[u'Man breaks into liquor store with forklift, leads police on low-speed chaseANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2013 Alaska police say a man used a stolen front-end loader to break into a liquor store and then led officers on a low-speed chase early Thursday.A witness flagged down Anchorage police about 3:20 a.m. to report a front-loader with forklift attachments had ripped off most of the front entrance to a Brown Jug, an Alaska liquor store chain.The witness saw the driver go inside, take bottles, then hop back on the front-loader and drive east.During a 15-mph chase, police followed the driver into a recreational vehicle park and blocked the only exit with patrol cars.Police say alcohol bottles were found inside the front-loader, which had been stolen from a construction site.Joseph Martin is being held on suspicion of criminal mischief, burglary, felony driving while intoxicated and other counts. His bail is set at $30,000.', u'WATCH: GoPro camera strapped to Cheetah running at full speedEver wondered what it would be like riding on the back of a Cheetah?Well, The Cincinnati Zoo uploaded a new video to YouTube showing the speeds you\u2019d be traveling at from the Cheetah\u2019s perspective after zoo keepers strapped a GoPro on to her back.According to The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden\u2019s YouTube Page, Savanna, a full grown Cheetah used in the zoo\u2019s running program, wasn\u2019t fazed about carrying a GoPro harness. Alicia Sampson, a trainer for the zoo\u2019s cat ambassador program, said that their cats are hand trained from a very young age.\u201cWe put [the GoPro harness] on Savanna and she could really care less,\u201d said Sampson. \u201cShe\u2019s used to harnesses and she\u2019s collared so it\u2019s just another day for her.\u201d', u'More than 4,000 migrants rescued in single dayROME \u2014 More than 4,000 would-be refugees were rescued at sea Thursday in one of the busiest days of the Mediterranean migrant crisis, and at least 20 died trying to reach Europe as Libyan-based smugglers took advantage of calmer seas to send desperate migrants north.The death toll was likely to grow far higher, however, as the Libyan coast guard also reported two overturned boats between the coastal cities of Sabratha and Zwara. Only four bodies were found, raising fears that the rest of those on board had perished.Overall, the Italian coast guard said it had coordinated 22 separate rescue operations Thursday that saved more than 4,000 lives.\u201cThat probably is a record,\u201d said coast guard spokesman Cmdr. Cosimo Nicastro, noting that previous highs have been in the range of 5,000 to 6,000 over two days.At least one smugglers\u2019 boat sank off Libya\u2019s coast, and 20 bodies were spotted floating in the sea, said Navy Lt. Rino Gentile, a spokesman for the EU\u2019s Mediterranean mission. Photos tweeted by the mission showed a bright blue dinghy submerged under the weight of migrants waving their arms in hope of rescue as an EU aircraft flew overhead.None had a life jacket.\t\t\t\n\t\tTwo Italian coast guard ships and the Spanish frigate Reina Sofia responded to the scene. Nicastro said 96 people were rescued.Barbara Molinario, spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency in Italy, said favorable weather conditions in May to October often encourage migrant crossings. She said prior to the recent rescues, some 40,000 people had been rescued so far this year, compared to 47,500 over the same period in 2015.Among those coming ashore Thursday in Sicily were the survivors of a dramatic capsizing a day earlier off Libya\u2019s coast. Footage provided by the Italian navy showed the steel-hulled smuggler ship rocked under the weight of its passengers and finally flipped, sending migrants into the water or clambering up the side.The Italian navy vessel Bettica brought the survivors and five bodies ashore in Porto Empedocle, Sicily. Red Cross workers took at least one migrant away in a stretcher, while rescue teams in white hazmat suits carried children down the plank to shore.In other rescues, a Libyan navy spokesman said a total of 766 migrants were rescued by the Libyan coast guard on Thursday.Col. Ayoub Gassim said they were found in two groups: one of 550 near the western coastal city of Sabratha and the second of 216 off Zwara.He said two other capsized boats were found empty in waters between the two cities and only four bodies were retrieved, with the rest of those aboard feared dead. He said he had no other details, including how many migrants had been aboard the boats.Before this week\u2019s deaths, the International Organization for Migration said only 13 people had drowned in the month of May, compared with 95 last May and 330 in May 2014. It said the figures \u201cindicate that migrant fatalities may at last be declining\u201d thanks to beefed-up coast guard monitoring along the North African coast.However, improved weather conditions appear to have led to an increase in the number of migrants risking the crossing.\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'Haida Gwaii caught in the midst of world plastic pollutionBritish Columbia\u2019s Haida Gwaii islands, with their\xa0long, rugged coastlines, temperate rainforest and unique wildlife, attract people from around the world to an area often referred to as \u2018the\xa0Galapagos of the North.\u2019But what most travellers don\u2019t expect to see on their visit to Haida Gwaii is the amount of plastic waste that washes up on the islands\u2019 supposedly immaculate\xa0shores.Because of their geographical location in\xa0the Pacific Ocean, far from the B.C. mainland, the islands of Haida Gwaii have always been hit by a steady influx of marine debris.But in recent years, the amount of plastic items drifting ashore has been growing, raising concern for local residents.The beaches of Haida Gwaii that are accessible to the general public get the benefit of beachcombers\xa0cleaning up some of\xa0the debris. But some of the more remote locations, only accessible by boat or air, nearly never get cleaned up, leaving debris to pile up.Taking a stroll down the remote,\xa0sandy\xa0East Beach, on the northeastern tip of Haida Gwaii, you can go for miles without seeing another human-being.But the signs of civilization can be seen\xa0everywhere.Poking out of the sand and jammed between beach logs, are\xa0plastic bottles, containers, marine buoys, fishing baskets and gear, pieces of Styrofoam, used tires, and even\xa0toothbrushes\xa0and rubber\xa0shoes.But it\u2019s what you don\u2019t immediately\xa0see that shows the true\xa0extent of the problem.Tiny pieces of\xa0broken-up\xa0plastic, sometimes only a few millimetres\xa0in diameter, are so numerous they often mix in with the sand \u2014 making it virtually impossible for even some of the more experienced beachcombers to see and pick up.\u201cSometimes you cruise by in a boat and it looks like the beach is clean, but then you look\xa0under the\xa0logs\xa0and\xa0there are tiny pieces of plastic everywhere,\u201d says Trent Moraes, a local resident whose company, Highlander Marine Services Ltd., helps\xa0clean up the debris.Plastic is used in many aspects of our daily lives because of\xa0how cheap and durable it is.A \xa0released in January suggests plastic production has surged over the past 50 years, from 15 million tonnes in 1964 to 311 million tonnes in 2014.The number is expected to double again over the next 20 years.But, the report also suggests that if our plastic consumption habits stay the way they are, oceans are expected to contain more plastics than fish by year 2050., including some\xa0,\xa0and at least  leak into the ocean every year.The tiny pieces of plastic that Moraes and other island residents have been noticing in recent years are the result of plastic debris getting weathered and pulverized by the force of the ocean.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says plastic will\xa0 until you can\u2019t see it anymore, but it never really fully goes away.Instead, it\xa0breaks\xa0down into smaller and smaller pieces, a process that\u2019s exacerbated by UV radiation, saltwater and the force of the surf.That means every single piece of plastic ever created still exists today.In fact,  a single one-litre plastic bottle could break down into enough small fragments to put one on every mile of beach in the entire world.NOAA says plastic debris can accumulate\xa0 up to 100,000 to 1,000,000 times the levels found in seawater. While it\u2019s still unclear whether these pollutants can seep from plastic debris into the organisms that happen to eat the debris, there is a serious concern that these contaminants may transfer through the food chain and all the way up to human consumption.Researchers have found small pieces of plastic\xa0found in the stomachs of many marine organisms, from plankton to whales. When fish and other marine life ingest small pieces of plastic, it could cause irritation or do damage to their digestive system,\xa0leading\xa0to malnutrition or starvation. plastic debris causes the deaths of more than a million seabirds every year, as well as more than 100,000 marine mammals.In Haida Gwaii, the problem is further exacerbated by powerful storms pushing deteriorated plastic along with other debris all the way up into the\xa0tree line, where it becomes part of the\xa0forest ecosystem, buried in the greenery and covered by moss \u2013 a\xa0disturbing\xa0sight for\xa0locals and tourists alike.The trick is to remove plastic debris from local\xa0beaches before it gets churned by the sea and pushed into the tree line, where it starts\xa0disintegrating to the point where removal is virtually impossible.After the , it was expected that Haida Gwaii would be hit with an increased volume of marine debris.So, in 2013, after the Japanese government offered Canada $1 million to help support the tsunami clean-up effort, community members joined forces to take things into their own hands and formed the Haida Gwaii Tsunami Debris Committee.The committee\xa0received a chunk of the Japanese funding \u2014 about $139,000. That allowed the group to hire contractors from around Haida Gwaii to\xa0clean up nearly 40 kilometers of local beaches and remove some 630 cubic meters of debris.Some of the debris is undoubtedly from Japan, but a substantial amount is what they just call \u201cworld garbage.\u201d\u201cMost of the plastic is not from a source that we can control,\u201d said marine ecologist Lynn Lee, a member of the Haida Gwaii Tsunami Debris Committee.\xa0\u201cIt comes from the Great Pacific garbage patch, industrial waste, fishing vessels.\u201cThese things happen outside of the boundaries of Haida Gwaii,\xa0but they are affecting\xa0the region.\u201dContractors have to use specialized trucks and boats to remove the debris from the remote beaches around Haida Gwaii \u2014 and\xa0they\u2019re usually filled up to capacity.\u201cWe can fill a boat within hours sometimes,\u201d said Moraes.The committee is also experimenting with using a helicopter to lift the debris out of very remote areas, but that would require substantially more money. The committee got an additional $115,000 from Japanese debris clean-up money this year. But this is\xa0the final round of funding, which officially runs out\xa0in March\xa02017.The committee is also looking into the possibility of chartering a barge to remove a larger amount of the debris all at one time. While\xa0it may not be economically feasible at this point, the debris collected on\xa0a barge could be shipped to a recycling facility.Currently, a great deal\xa0of\xa0the collected marine garbage\xa0ends up at a local landfill. A few\xa0items\xa0get recycled\xa0by local fishermen and a small portion goes into a smaller local recycling operation, but the majority of the debris, including deteriorated plastics, are left to rot in the ground.Moraes and others are looking into bringing in technology that could potentially convert marine garbage into biofuel.James Cowpar,\xa0the operator of local tour company called Haida Styles, said guides often take guests to areas heavily impacted by plastic pollution.The reaction is nearly always the same \u2013 people are stunned by what they see\xa0and want\xa0to help.\u201cYou can imagine going to an ancient village site in Gwaii Haanas and the first thing you are going to see is garbage,\u201d said Cowpar. \u201cWe have actually taken guests out to participate [in the clean-ups] and we found it very rewarding.\xa0While on tour, we try to grab as much [garbage] as we can.\u201dHe said educating visitors and talking about\xa0the bigger picture is part of their company\u2019s mandate.Part of their effort to help mitigate the situation involves not\xa0carrying plastic water bottles for their clients on\xa0their tour boats and using\xa0water containers with reusable cups instead.So far, he said, the reaction from their guests\xa0has been nothing but positive.\u201cGlobal pollution is a huge problem,\u201d said Cowpar. \u201cPeople believe that national parks and protected areas are free of pollution and that\u2019s\xa0simply\xa0not the case. It tends to be an indirect dumping ground.\u201dWith the Japanese funding drying up, Moraes\xa0said\xa0he wants to see more support from all levels of Canadian government.He\xa0said there should also be a feasibility study done on how to handle the amount of the debris coming in the\xa0future.\u201cThere is so much work to be done. We have been going strong for the last few years, but we are still not even close to getting it all collected,\u201d\xa0said Moraes. \u201cWe really need to figure something out for the long-term: find some dedicated money for this. The province and the federal government really should step up and address this huge issue.\u201dThe B.C. Ministry of Environment told Global News\xa0there are no immediate plans to fund the non-tsunami debris clean-up. The ministry said\xa0further resources will be allocated as necessary\xa0if a\xa0major increase in tsunami debris is experienced.But Lucy Stefanyk, the Haida Gwaii supervisor with BC Parks and a member of the committee, said marine debris, including plastics, will\xa0always be\xa0something that they\xa0will continue to grapple with.Lee said raising awareness about marine garbage in Haida Gwaii\xa0is also an opportunity to show the world\xa0how its actions somewhere far away are having an impact on\xa0a place like\xa0the islands.\u201cThere is no easy solution aside from minimizing plastic production and use,\u201d Lee said.Canada produces about  of the total world volume of plastic products. Canadian and worldwide demand for plastic products are expected to continue growing faster than the economy as a whole.Currently, Canadians take home an estimated , for a total of 2.86 billion bags per year.Canadians also consume more than , and globally, we consume about 190 billion litres a year.\u201cReduce what you are consuming, reduce the overusing,\u201d said Lee, adding plastic pollution is just a symptom of a larger\xa0problem.', u'Where Obama and his family will live after they leave the White HouseWASHINGTON \u2013 Real estate circles are buzzing over reports that President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have decided to lease a nine-bedroom mansion in one of Washington\u2019s poshest neighbourhoods when he leaves office in January.With a sprawling terrace and a castle-like exterior, the home sits on a quarter-acre lot just down the road from the Naval Observatory, the vice-president\u2019s official residence, in the wealthy Kalorama neighbourhood near Embassy Row. A 2011 remodel brought the total number of bathrooms to eight-and-a-half, along with three fireplaces and an \u201cau pair suite,\u201d spread out over roughly 8,200 square feet, according to real estate data. It features parking for up to 10 cars.Peg Mancuso, the president of the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors, called the area \u201cclearly one of the best neighbourhoods in the Washington Metropolitan area.\u201d She said if the reports are true, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have picked a better neighbourhood for his family.\u201d\u201cIt seemed like the perfect choice,\u201d Manusco said.The mansion\u2019s owners, President Bill Clinton\u2019s former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart and his wife, live in New York, where he works for the NFL. The White House declined to comment on the possibility of the Obamas renting the property, first reported by .An individual familiar with the Obamas\u2019 plans said they had started their housing search and were currently looking at rental properties in a number of Washington neighbourhoods, including Kalorama. The individual wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the issue publicly and requested anonymity.It was unclear whether the Obamas had settled on the Kalorama property and formally leased it or whether they were still considering other options. Obama\u2019s aides and friends have been reluctant to discuss his plans in light of the intense security preparations the U.S. Secret Service must undertake to ensure the first family can be adequately protected while living in a private home.Obama has said publicly that he and his family plan to stay in Washington after leaving the White House until their youngest daughter, 14-year-old Sasha Obama, graduates from high school. Sasha\u2019s older sister, Malia Obama, graduates from high school this year and .\u201cTransferring someone in the middle of high school \u2014 tough,\u201d Obama said earlier this year in Milwaukee.Built in the 1920s, the mansion last sold in 2013 for about $5.3 million \u2014 a drop from the list price of about $6 million, according to real estate records. It was put on the market in 2012 for just under $8 million but later removed.For years, Obama has complained publicly about the lack of privacy that comes with life in the White House, and has said he\u2019s eagerly awaiting the day he can recapture some of the anonymity and freedom of movement he enjoyed before becoming president. Though his decision to remain temporarily in Washington may delay that, Obama is expected to spend considerable time in the coming years in Chicago, where his family owns a home and where his presidential library will be built, as well as in New York and in Hawaii, where Obama was born.\xa0', u'Researchers develop wheelchair controlled by facial expressionsResearchers at a Brazilian robotics have developed technology that\xa0allows a person to control a wheelchair with simple facial expressions., a S\xe3o Paulo-based company, saw a gap in the market for wheelchair users who needed an efficient hands-free option that didn\u2019t require sensors or contraptions attached to the user\u2019s body.\u201cWe compared technologies developed 10 years ago to technologies today and we noticed that the improvements were not so significant,\u201d wrote\xa0HOOBOX CEO Paulo Pinheiro\xa0in an email to Global News.The  uses a laptop or tablet hooked up to a facial recognition camera which reads 80 points on a human face. So far, the technology recognizes eight expressions which can each be assigned to a certain movement\xa0or to stop the wheelchair.Pinheiro said the user can still maintain \u201cmoderate conversation\u201d without interrupting the operation of the Wheelie and said the second generation prototype is already able to recognize voice commands, head and iris movements. Functions such as the voice command can toggle the interface\xa0on and off if the user wants to stop and engage in an expressive conversation.The company said it has already received its first round of funding from investors and expects the first Wheelie model to be on the market by the end of 2018.', 'Why did this Kansas tornado last for 90 minutes?', u'Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders toss around possibility of debateWASHINGTON \u2013 Chances are likely slim, but what about a Donald Trump-Bernie Sanders debate heading into the crucial June 7 California primary?That possibility surfaced Wednesday, even if in a jocular tone, in an indirect exchange between the Republican billionaire real estate mogul and the senator who Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t been able to bump from the Democratic presidential sweepstakes.On ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d Trump said he enjoyed watching Clinton\u2019s increasingly heated sparring with Sanders.\xa0 \t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cI had no idea it was going to be so nasty,\u201d said Trump, who said he\u2019d be happy to engage Sanders in a one-on-one debate \u2014 as long as significant money goes to charity.Sanders said on Twitter he\u2019d welcome that. \u201cGame on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'WATCH: French protesters clash with riot police over labour law disputeLE HAVRE, France \u2013 French protesters scuffled with police, dock workers set off smoke bombs and union activists disrupted fuel supplies and nuclear plants Thursday in the biggest challenge yet to President Francois Hollande\u2019s government as it tries to give employers more flexibility.   On a day of nationwide strikes and protests, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls opened the door to possible changes in the labour bill that\u2019s triggering all the anger \u2013 but said the government would not abandon it. Union activists said it\u2019s too late to compromise. Posters at a protest in the port of Le Havre bore a blood red tombstone representing the bill reading: \u201cNot amendable, not negotiable: Withdraw the El Khomri Law.\u201d   The draft law, aimed at boosting hiring after a decade of nearly 10 per cent unemployment and slow but corrosive economic decline, relaxes rules around the 35-hour work week, weakens the power of unions and leaves workers less protected from layoffs.   Determined to defend France\u2019s labour protections, union activists have targeted the strategic fuel industry in recent days, causing gasoline shortages. The country\u2019s two main oil ports were blocked Thursday and only two of the France\u2019s eight refineries were working, the head of the UFIP oil industry lobby, Francis Duseux, told The Associated Press.   \u201cThere could be improvements and modifications\u201d in the bill, Valls said on BFM television Thursday. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what might be changed, and insisted that the \u201cheart\u201d of the bill \u2013 a measure weakening the power of unions over workplace rules \u2013 should remain.   Withdrawing the bill \u201cis not possible,\u201d he said.Union activists and ordinary workers took to the streets in several cities. In Paris, police detained nine people and scuffled with masked protesters as several thousands marched from the Bastille plaza through eastern Paris.   Members of the firmly leftist CGT union, leading the protests, remain angry that the government forced the bill through the lower house of parliament without a vote because of division in the Socialist majority.\u201cValls is hardening his tone? Well we\u2019re hardening our tone, too!\u201d an organizer shouted into a loudspeaker at the Normandy Bridge, in northern France, where some 200 to 300 trade unionists and other protesters gathered to block traffic.   The union activists then made their way into the port city of Le Havre, waving red flags, a percussion band leading the way.At least 10,000 dock workers and others poured into an esplanade in front of Le Havre city hall, setting off smoke bombs and threatening bystanders. They tossed powerful fireworks into the fountains, sending plumes of water rising into the air as the square reverberated with explosions.   The demonstration was rowdy at times \u2013 one AP journalist was egged and the protesters pelted the mayor\u2019s office with paint bombs \u2013 yet protesters took care to stay off the manicured lawn. One demonstrator was spotted urinating against the mayor\u2019s office beside bright yellow graffiti reading: \u201cHollande, Valls, Resign.\u201d   Fabien Gloaguen, an activist with the militant Worker\u2019s Force movement, said the government would have to back down.\u201cHe\u2019s going to withdraw it,\u201d Gloaguen said.   Valls insisted the bill is \u201cgood for workers\u201d and small businesses, and argued that many of its critics are ill-informed of its contents.   In addition to loosening rules about the 35-hour work week, the bill makes it easier to fire workers in times of economic downturn, and weakens the power of unions to set working conditions across an entire sector.   The stakes are high for both Hollande and the unions. The president is hopeful of getting re-elected next year, despite being deeply unpopular, and needs to show he has the strength to push through reforms. The unions are fighting for relevance, having lost membership in recent years.   \u201cWe\u2019re at an interesting juncture. If the movement finishes once more in failure, it might make further mobilization more complicated,\u201d said Stephane Sirot, a historian of the French union movement at the University of Cergy-Pontoise.   He said it\u2019s been decades since a left-wing government has been confronted with a nationwide strike of this magnitude.   Two months of protests escalated over the past week as unions targeted the sensitive oil industry, blocking fuel depots and refineries.   The government has started using its strategic fuel reserves and forcing depots to reopen, but supplies remained spotty Thursday, with long lines and caps on purchases.   Drivers endured long waits to reach gas pumps, railing at the strikes, the government and the overall funk in France. Prices have risen noticeably at gas pumps and some stations are rationing.   But at the blocked Normandy Bridge, at least one pair of travellers said they didn\u2019t mind.   \u201cIt\u2019s for us that they\u2019re doing this,\u201d said Jean-Luc Geraert, whose battered white van was caught behind the makeshift barricade.Geraert, a 55-year-old industrial painter, said if the government doesn\u2019t back down soon, \u201cit\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d', u'2 US Navy fighter jets collide off North Carolina coast, 4 injuredRALEIGH, N.C. \u2013 Two Navy jet fighters collided off the coast of North Carolina during a routine training mission on Thursday, sending four people to the hospital, officials said.The F/A-18 Super Hornet jet fighters, based in Virginia Beach, collided about 10:40 a.m. off the coast of Cape Hatteras, said Navy spokesman Ensign Mark Rockwellpate. Four crew members were taken to a hospital in Norfolk, but Rockwellpate said he didn\u2019t have information about the extent of their injuries.A safety investigation will be carried out to determine the cause of the accident, he said.The four survivors were plucked off a commercial fishing ship that pulled them out of the Atlantic Ocean and flown by Coast Guard helicopter to a hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer 3rd Class Joshua Canup.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tThe helicopter was dispatched from the Coast Guard\u2019s air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The station\u2019s helicopters perform ocean search-and-rescue operations off North Carolina and Virginia as far east as Bermuda.', u'Mentally disabled football player \u2018brutally raped\u2019 with coat hanger by teammates, lawsuit claimsThe family of a black mentally disabled high school football player in Idaho has filed a $10-million lawsuit against the school district after he was allegedly \u201cbrutally raped\u201d with a coat hanger by white teammates.The suit claims the incident happened inside a high school locker room last October following months of racially motivated bullying, harassment, and assaults that had been brought to the school\u2019s attention.The three players accused of carrying out the attack allegedly restrained the victim Oct. 23, 2015, shoved a coat hanger into the victim\u2019s anus, and then kicked the hanger several times causing serious injuries.\u201cI screamed,\u201d the victim told investigators, according to . \u201cI was pretty upset. I felt really bad. A little bit betrayed and confused at the same time. It was terrible \u2014 a pain I\u2019ve never felt.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re merely allegations at this point but they\u2019re of course serious allegations for any school district,\u201d former Idaho Attorney General David Leroy told .The family alleges Dietrich School District and 11 employees failed to address the abuses, which included the victim being forced to fight teammate John Howard, a white 18-year-old from Texas who moved to the small Idaho town to live with relatives after getting in trouble.\u201cThis young man should have been protected,\u201d E. Lee Schlender, co-counsel for the victim\u2019s family, told .The suit alleges \u201cThe victim was taunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names included \u2018Kool-Aid,\u2019 \u2018chicken eater,\u2019 \u2018watermelon,\u2019 and [the N-word].\u201dThe lawsuit follows an investigation that resulted in the state attorney general\u2019s office filing sexual assault charges against the three accused in March.Howard and 17-year-old Tanner Ward have been charged as adults and could face life in prison.The third accused is 16 and could not be identified.The civil suit goes on to allege that the victim was forced to sing \u201cNotorious KKK,\u201d a violent and racist rap song set to Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t You See.\u201d\u201cThis is not Idaho. This is not our culture, this is not our people,\u201d Schlender said. \u201cFor something like this to happen \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute aberration.\u201dOther alleged abuses described in the lawsuit included coaches encouraging other players to beat the victim until he was unconscious, painful wedgies, and having a racist picture of a school bus drawn on a chalkboard showing the victim sitting in the back.', u'Plucky 7-year-old punches gun-toting thief in the gut during armed robberyA\xa0gun-toting thief in a Maryland video game store got a little more than he bargained for last Friday when he was confronted by a brave seven-year-old.Security cameras inside the GameStop store in Silver Spring, Md. captured the incredible (and scary) moment the young boy responds to the armed robber \u2014 by socking\xa0him in the stomach.Montgomery County police said the robbery took place at 8:56 p.m.Friday when two male suspects, armed with handguns, entered the store. Police say the suspects ordered the three customers inside the store, including the boy, to stand against the wall.In the video, one of the men grabs the little boy, prompting him to throw several punches into the man\u2019s midsection.\u201cIt was scary. You\u2019re never prepared for something like that. You\u2019re not. So, you don\u2019t wish it on your worst enemy,\u201d the boy\u2019s father added.The identity of the boy and his family are being withheld at this time.According to police, the men ordered the store clerks to lie behind the counter before taking an undisclosed sum from the cash register.A  describes the suspects as black males in their 20s, approximately 5\u2032 6\u2033 tall and weighing 170 pounds.\xa0 They were wearing black, hooded sweatshirts, black pants, gloves, and masks.', u'\u2018When you find my body, please call my husband\u2019: Missing hiker found dead kept journal, survived 26 daysAUGUSTA, Maine \u2013 An Appalachian Trail hiker whose remains were discovered last year survived at least 26 days after getting lost, kept a journal of her ordeal and ultimately resigned herself to the idea she was going to die and it could be years before her remains were located, according to investigatory documents.Geraldine Largay, who was from Brentwood, Tennessee, hiked to higher ground in a failed attempt to get a cellphone signal, and text messages sent to her husband went undelivered, the documents show.\u201cWhen you find my body, please call my husband George \u2026 and my daughter Kerry,\u201d Largay, who was 66 years old, wrote in a page that was torn out of her journal. \u201cIt will be the greatest kindness for them to know that I am dead where you found me \u2013 no matter how many years from now.\u201dThe Maine Warden Service on Wednesday released more than 1,500 pages of documents related to the search for Largay in response to Freedom of Access Act requests by several media organizations.Largay, who went by the nickname Inchworm, got lost after leaving the trail on July 22, 2013, to relieve herself and set up her final camp the next day, wardens said. Her texts to her husband warning that she\u2019d become lost were never delivered but were retrieved from her phone after her body was found.\u201cin somm trouble,\u201d she texted on July 22, 2013, the day she left the trail. \u201cGot off trail to go to br. now lost. can you call AMC to c if a trail maintainer can help me. somewhere north of woods road.\u201dA day later, she again pleaded for help: \u201clost since yesterday. off trail 3 or 4 miles. call police for what to do pls.\u201dAfter she missed a rendezvous with her husband, he reported her missing on July 24, 2013, setting off a massive search by the Maine Warden Service and other agencies. Documents indicate they interviewed dozens of witnesses and conducted several searches over two years.The last entry in Largay\u2019s journal was on Aug. 18, 2013.Her husband, George Largay, told wardens that the Appalachian Trail journey from Georgia to Maine\u2019s Mount Katahdin was a bucket list item for her. She had started with a travelling companion, but the other hiker left the trail because of a family emergency.It wasn\u2019t until more than two years after she went missing, in October 2015, that her remains were found by a contractor conducting a forestry survey on property owned by the U.S. Navy in Redington Township.The property where Largay\u2019s body was recovered is part of a Navy survival skills training facility. The Navy uses the area for its Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape program.Largay\u2019s tent was collapsed, and her body was inside. The medical examiner determined she died of starvation and exposure.The items found with her included trail staples such as toothpaste, baby powder, a first aid kit, cord, twine, a pencil and pen and a paper trail map. The battery on her cellphone was dead, but investigators were able to retrieve the data.', u'WATCH: Proposed bus in China allows cars to drive underneath itDrivers who get frustrated being stuck behind stop-and-go buses on busy streets, causing a back-up of traffic, might appreciate this newly proposed bus unveiled in China.The Transit Elevated Bus (TEB)\xa0that\xa0straddles the street, was unveiled at the  in Beijing last weekend.The bus could carry more than a thousand passengers and take up no space on the road, allowing traffic to flow smoothly beneath it. In a country with about 20 million new drivers hitting the road each year, and one that is battling intensive air pollution,\xa0the proposal is one that appears to be quite inviting.The bus could ease traffic congestion, as well as become more inviting for commuters.However, it\u2019s unclear as to how feasible it will be as the model only used cars and didn\u2019t include trucks and other large\xa0vehicles. As well, no safety barriers were in place in the model, which could raise safety concerns.', u'Dramatic images capture the moment a boat carrying hundreds of migrants sank, killing 5It has become an all-too familiar sight in the waters off the coast of Italy.Overloaded boats, crammed\xa0with asylum seekers, capsizing under the weight of their passengers in the Mediterranean and dumping\xa0hundreds of men, women and children into the waters to either sink or swim.The Italian navy\xa0released a series of startling images this week of one such incident, showing an overloaded trawler in the process of tipping over, and people struggling to stay afloat as they waited for rescue.Astoundingly, the vast majority of the passengers survived and were picked up by navy boats. Of the more than 500 people on board, five reportedly drowned. One official with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) called it \u201ca miracle,\u201d especially given how many of the passengers were below deck when the trawler tipped.More than three dozen\xa0smuggling vessels have required rescue in the southern Mediterranean since the start of the week, according to the navy. They are just the tip of the iceberg, however.The\xa0IOM is reporting that a little over 191,000\xa0migrants and refugees\xa0have reached\xa0Europe by sea between Jan. 1 and\xa0May 21, 2016. They have mainly landed in Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Spain.Deaths over\xa0the same time period on all Mediterranean routes stand at 1,370, the organization says, which is 24 percent lower than 2015\u2019s total of 1,792 through the same period.Since the start of the year, the number of Syrian refugees arriving in Italy by boat has been low. The majority of\xa0passengers\xa0are now from sub-Saharan Africa, fleeing conflict and repressive regimes in\xa0Nigeria, Somalia, Gambia and Eritrea.Once they have been rescued, people\xa0plucked from the sea are normally\xa0taken to Italy and told they must leave within a week. It is no longer possible to apply for asylum at the Austrian-Italian border, a policy which prevents most from moving into Europe.', u'Ottawa shooting hero Kevin Vickers tackles protester at Ireland remembrance ceremonyFormer Sergeant-at-Arms , the man credited with stopping a gunman in a firefight on , can be seen in photos tackling a protester during a ceremony honouring British soldiers in Dublin, Ireland.According to the\xa0, Vickers was the first to jump into action when a protester interrupted an event at Grangegorman Military Cemetery Thursday morning to commemorate the British soldiers who died in 1916.A male protester stood up and yelled \u201cthis is an insult\u201d before Vickers, who is the Canadian Ambassador to Ireland, physically restrained the man before police could\xa0intervene.\u201cThe whole thing lasted about a minute.

According to local media outlets, the closures are due to a massive increase in tourism, causing irreversible damage to the endangered coral reef.\u201cTour groups spend at least three hours swimming, feeding fish and snorkelling, which severely damages the marine ecosystem, especially on coral reefs,\u201d \u201cThe reasons for coral damage in the Koh Khai area is from the coral-bleaching process, which occurs naturally and from human activity. This includes the increasing number of tourists, boats that anchor on the corals, people walking on corals while playing in the water, feeding marine animals and catching them to take photos of with them.\u201dAccording to the report, over 60 speedboats full of tourists visit the three islands every day.Photos on Instagram show just how crowded Koh Khai Nok has become, with dozens of sun chairs and umbrellas crowding the beach. According to reviews on Trip Advisor, many tourists complained of being gouged by locals to rent the chairs.A post on the DMCR Facebook page said vendors and tourist booths on the islands must be gone within two days.Earlier this month, officials were forced to close\xa0Koh Tachai island, known as one of the most beautiful beaches in Thailand. According to reports,  and had become overrun with food stands and tour boats.Koh Tachai island was rated  in 2015 and is one of the highest-rated attractions in ', u'Trump reaches magic number to clinch Republican nominationWASHINGTON \u2013  on Thursday reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination for president, completing an unlikely rise that has upended the political landscape and sets the stage for a bitter fall campaign.Trump was put over the top in the Associated Press delegate count by a small number of the party\u2019s unbound delegates who told the AP they would support him at the convention. Among them is Oklahoma GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard.It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president. Trump has reached 1,238. With 303 delegates at stake in five state primaries on June 7, Trump will easily pad his total, avoiding a contested convention in Cleveland in July.Trump, a political neophyte who for years delivered caustic commentary on the state of the nation from the sidelines but had never run for office, fought off 16 other Republican contenders in an often ugly primary race.Many on the right have been slow to warm to Trump, wary of his conservative bona fides. Others worry about Trump\u2019s crass personality and the lewd comments he\u2019s made about women.But millions of grassroots activists, many who have been outsiders to the political process, have embraced Trump as a plain-speaking populist who is not afraid to offend.Steve House, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party and an unbound delegate who confirmed his support of Trump to AP, said he likes the billionaire\u2019s background as a businessman.\u201cLeadership is leadership,\u201d House said. \u201cIf he can surround himself with the political talent, I think he will be fine.\u201dOthers who confirmed their decision to back Trump were more tepid, saying they are supporting him out of a sense of obligation because he won their state\u2019s primary.Cameron Linton of Pittsburgh said he will back Trump on the first ballot since he won the presidential primary vote in Linton\u2019s congressional district.\u201cIf there\u2019s a second ballot I won\u2019t vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Linton said. \u201cHe\u2019s ridiculous. There\u2019s no other way to say it.\u201dTrump\u2019s path to the Republican presidential nomination began with an escalator ride.Trump and his wife, Melania, descended an escalator into the basement lobby of the Trump Tower on June 16, 2015, for an announcement many observers said would never come: The celebrity real estate developer, who had flirted with running for office in the past, would announce that he was launching his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.That speech set the tone for the candidate\u2019s ability to dominate the headlines with provocative statements, insults and hyperbole. He called Mexicans \u201crapists,\u201d promised to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and ban Muslims from the U.S. for an indeterminate time.He put down women based on their looks. And he unleashed an uncanny marketing ability in which he deduced his critics\u2019 weak points and distilled those to nicknames that stuck. \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, \u201cWeak\u201d Jeb Bush and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz, among others, all were forced into primarily reacting to Trump. They fell one-by-one \u2014 leaving Trump sole survivor of a riotous Republican primary.His rallies became must-see events and magnets for free publicity. Onstage, he dispensed populism that drew thousands of supporters, many wearing his trademark \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and chanting, \u201cBuild the wall!\u201dThe events drew protests too\u2014 with demonstrators sometimes being forcibly ejected from the proceedings. One rally in Chicago was cancelled after thousands of demonstrators surrounded the venue and the Secret Service could no longer vouch for the candidate\u2019s safety.When voting started, Trump was not so fast out of the gate.He lost the Iowa caucuses in February, falling behind Cruz and barely edging Rubio for second. He recovered in New Hampshire. From there he and Cruz fiercely engaged, with Trump winning some and losing some but one way or another dominating the rest of the primary season \u2014 in votes or at least in attention \u2014 and ultimately in delegates.All the while, Republican leaders declared themselves appalled by Trump\u2019s rise. Conservatives called the onetime Democrat a fraud. But they failed, ultimately, to block him. Republican leaders slowly, warily, began meeting with Trump and his staff. And he began winning endorsements from a few members of Congress.As with other aspects of his campaign, Trump upended the traditional role of money in the race.He incurred relatively low campaign costs \u2014 just $57 million through the end of April. He covered most of it with at least $43 million of his own money loaned to the campaign. He spent less than $21 million on paid television and radio commercials. That\u2019s about one-quarter of what Jeb Bush and his allies spent on TV. Bush dropped out of the race three months ago, after disappointing results in South Carolina.Trump, 69, the son of a New York City real estate magnate, had risen to fame in the 1980s and 1990s, overseeing major real estate deals, watching his financial fortunes rise, then fall, hosting \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d TV show and authoring more than a dozen books.', u'World leaders right to be worried by rise of Donald Trump, Obama saysSHIMA, Japan \u2013 U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday that foreign leaders are \u201crattled\u201d by  and have good reason to feel that way, as he accused the presumptive Republican presidential nominee of ignorance about world affairs.Weighing in on the Democratic race to replace him, Obama also downplayed concerns that the protracted fight between  and  is hurting his party\u2019s chances, brushing off their escalating attacks as the inevitable \u201cgrumpiness\u201d of a primary campaign.Obama offered his assessment of the presidential campaign on the sidelines of a Group of Seven advanced economies summit in Japan, the latest world gathering to be colored by global concerns about Trump. Obama said foreign leaders at the conference were unsure how seriously to take his pronouncements.He contrasted that to proposals that thoughtfully address what\u2019s required to keep the U.S. safe and prosperous and \u201cto keep the world on an even keel.\u201dQuestions about the unpredictable Trump have increasingly trailed Obama when he travels overseas, with world leaders incredulously sizing up a leading presidential candidate who speaks of banning Muslim immigration, starting trade wars and spreading nuclear weapons to Japan and South Korea. Obama has said that Trump now comes up in every one of his foreign meetings, with the president offering reassurances that he doesn\u2019t believe Trump will be elected.Though Obama has generally avoided opining on the presidential race, particularly while the Democratic primary continues to play out, he\u2019s made no secret of his distaste for Trump, whose election would mark a sharp departure from Obama in both tone and substance. In addition to opposing the sweeping Asia-Pacific free trade deal that Obama brokered, Trump has threatened to renegotiate Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and the global climate pact reached in Paris.Obama, taking questions the day before he pays a historic visit to Hiroshima, said foreign countries pay more attention to U.S. elections than Americans do to theirs because they count on the U.S. to provide stability and direction in addressing global challenges.Obama\u2019s comments to reporters came amid growing Democratic impatience to see the party unite behind Clinton, who is close to netting the number of delegates needed for the nomination but has unable to persuade Sanders to exit the race. Many Democrats, including prominent senators, have started publicly voicing frustration with Sanders, who shows no signs of a quick departure despite near-impossible odds of overtaking Clinton.Rather, Sanders has warned of a potentially \u201cmessy\u201d Democratic Convention in Philadelphia in July, stoking concerns for the Democratic Party and for Clinton\u2019s campaign, both of which are eager to shift their focus to attacking Trump and courting voters needed to win the general election in November.Yet Obama brushed off calls for him to get more personally involved in brokering a resolution, saying that he\u2019s still inclined to let the Democratic primary play itself out. He likened the hard-fought campaign between Clinton and Sanders to the one he waged with Clinton in 2008.\u201cDuring primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other. Somebody\u2019s supporter pops off and there\u2019s a certain buildup of aggravation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cEvery little speed bump, conflict trash-talking that takes place is elevated.\u201dHe urged both Democratic candidates to \u201ctry to stick to the issues,\u201d adding that the grumpiness often stems from voters\u2019 frustration when the campaign instead becomes dominated by talk about \u201cpersonalities and character.\u201dAsked about the Taliban\u2019s new leader, Obama said he was not optimistic about a change for the better any time soon despite the U.S. drone strike that killed former Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour, who had refused to engage in reconciliation talks with Afghanistan\u2019s government.Mansour\u2019s replacement, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, has signalled intentions to continue Mansour\u2019s aggressive approach. But Obama said he never expected \u201ca liberal Democrat\u201d to be the newly appointed leader of the Taliban.\u201cIn the short term, we anticipate the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence,\u201d Obama said. He added that he was hopeful that eventually \u201cwhen there are those within the community that surround the Taliban that recognize their goals are best achieved by negotiations.\u201d', u'Oil surges past $50 for first time in 7 monthsThe price of oil broke through the $50 a barrel barrier Thursday morning for the first time in seven months.U.S. crude traded as high as US$50.21\xa0after the U.S. government reported a larger-than-expected drop in fuel stockpiles for last week.In Europe, Brent crude \u2013 which is used to price international oils \u2014 cracked the $50 mark as well.But prices settled back below that mark a couple of hours later. By noon ET, West Texas crude was trading at US$49.67.Oil prices have been rising steadily in 2016 after hitting a 14-year low of around $26 a barrel in February.The surge in prices today is helping to push up oil-based currencies, like the Canadian dollar. This morning, it was trading at 77.19 cents US, up four-tenths of a cent from Wednesday\u2019s close. By noon, the dollar was trading at just under 77.1 cents US.As well, global stock markets were mostly higher on\xa0Thursday in reaction to oil\u2019s steady rise.\u201cThis move does appear to have been coming for the\xa0last couple of weeks, the question now is whether it can establish\xa0itself in a new range between $50 and $55,\u201d said Craig Erlam,\xa0senior market analyst at OANDA. \u201cWhile supply disruptions are\xa0likely to continue to support prices for now, a further\xa0strengthening in the dollar over the next couple of months could act\xa0as something of a counterweight and keep prices in check.\u201dEarlier this month, oil hit fresh highs for the year due in part to unrest in Nigeria and the . In Nigeria, attacks by militants in Niger Delta region cut the country\u2019s daily output by 800,000 barrels.In Alberta, oilsands production came to a near standstill as the Fort McMurray wildfire forced tens of thousands of people to flee the city and nearby oilsands camps.\u2014\xa0', u'Day of strikes, protests and fuel blockades in France over labour billLE HAVRE, France \u2013 With union activists disrupting fuel supplies, trains and nuclear plants, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls opened the door Thursday to possible changes in a labour bill that has sparked intensifying strikes and protests \u2013 but insisted the government will not abandon it.The reform, aimed at boosting hiring by loosening protection for French workers, has escalated into the toughest challenge yet to President Francois Hollande and his Socialist government.\u201cThere could be improvements and modifications\u201d in the bill, Valls said on BFM television Thursday. He didn\u2019t elaborate on what might be changed, and insisted that the \u201cheart\u201d of the bill should remain. Withdrawing the bill \u201cis not possible,\u201d he said.Members of the CGT union immediately dismissed the gesture, saying they want the bill scrapped, not modified. \u201cIt\u2019s inadmissible,\u201d said Arnaud Pacot of the CGT in the Aube region of eastern France said on BFM from a nuclear plant being blocked by activists.Union activists blocked a major bridge across the Seine River on France\u2019s northern coast and a tunnel in Marseille as part of protest actions and one-day strikes around the country Thursday against the bill.Demonstrators gathered early Thursday morning at a central square in the venerable port town of Harfleur, setting off fireworks and air horns. Activists were unapologetic about the disruption they planned.\u201cWe have to hit where it hurts,\u201d said union official Gilles Guyomard. \u201cAnd where it hurts is the bosses\u2019 wallets.\u201dThe activists then went to the 2-kilometre-long Normandy Bridge at Le Havre, setting a pile of tires aflame and blocking toll booths. Protesters dispersed two hours later after closures that snarled traffic and stranded motorists.At least one pair of travellers said they didn\u2019t mind.\u201cIt\u2019s for us that they\u2019re doing this,\u201d said Jean-Luc Geraert, whose battered white van was caught behind the makeshift barricade set up at the entrance to the bridge.Geraert, a 55-year-old industrial painter, said Valls needed to withdraw the law.\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201dValls insisted the bill is \u201cgood for workers\u201d and small businesses, and argued that many of its critics are ill-informed of its contents.The bill loosens the 35-hour workweek, makes it easier to fire workers in times of economic downturn, and weakens the power of unions to set working conditions across an entire sector.', u'Python slithers out of toilet, bites man\u2019s penisBANGKOK \u2013 A Thai man is recovering from a bloody encounter with a 3-meter (10-foot) python that slithered through the plumbing of his home and latched its jaws onto his penis as he was using a squat toilet.Attaporn Boonmakchuay was smiling as Thai television stations interviewed him in his hospital bed about the intimate intrusion, and doctors said he would recover. But photos of his blood-splattered bathroom in Chachoengsao province, east of Bangkok, were testimony to his ordeal.The 38-year-old told Thai TV Channel 7 that he struggled to remove the snake for 30 minutes Wednesday before he managed to free himself with help from his wife and a neighbour. After his wife tied a rope around the snake, Attaporn pried open its jaws before passing out.Emergency workers dismantled the Asian-style squat toilet, with the python still twined through it. The snake was taken away to be released back into the wild, according to an emergency responder cited by the newspaper Thai Rath.Doctors said Attaporn, bloodied but unbowed, will recover.\u201cHe has a really good attitude\u2026 even though his own wife and children were in shock. He\u2019s been smiling and giving interviews all day from his bed.\u201d hospital director Dr. Chutima Pincharoen said.', u'NASA inflates expandable room on the space stationCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2013 It\u2019s pump-it-up day at the International Space Station.NASA is releasing air into an inflatable room delivered last month by SpaceX. If all goes well, the pod will swell four times in volume and demonstrate a new way of living for astronauts. The hour-long process began Thursday morning 250 miles above Earth.Astronaut Jeffrey Williams opened a valve that allowed air to slowly flow into the inflatable chamber, called BEAM. That stands for Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. It\u2019s the creation of Bigelow Aerospace, founded by hotel entrepreneur Robert Bigelow. NASA paid the North Las Vegas company $17.8 million to test the inflatable-habitat concept at the space station.Williams and his crewmates won\u2019t venture inside BEAM \u2013 the world\u2019s first inflatable room for astronauts \u2013 until next week.', u'Taliban leader travelled with false name, fake Pakistani ID when killed: officialISLAMABAD \u2013 The foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan\u2019s prime minister says \u201call indicators\u201d confirm that Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in a U.S. drone strike in the country\u2019s southwest while travelling under a false name with a fake Pakistani identity document.At a news briefing Thursday, Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan was awaiting the DNA test results, after which his body will be handed to his relatives.Aziz condemns the strike, calling it a violation of Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty. He says that \u201cwe have conveyed our serious concern to the United States on this issue.\u201dAziz says the drone attack has \u201cundermined the Afghan peace process\u201d but he still believes that the way to resolve the Afghanistan\u2019s conflict is through negotiation.', u'Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370: Debris in Mozambique, Mauritius to be analyzedSYDNEY, Australia \u2013 Three pieces of debris found washed ashore in Mozambique and the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius will be examined by investigators in Australia to see if they came from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials said Thursday.Two of the pieces were found in Mauritius, and one was discovered in Mozambique, Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester said. Other debris from the Boeing 777 that vanished two years ago has previously been found in both countries.The Malaysian government is arranging to collect the items, Chester said in a statement. The debris will then be flown to Australia for examination.Chester did not release details on what the debris looked like or who found them, saying only that the items are \u201cof interest.\u201dTwo weeks ago, officials said a piece of engine cowling found in South Africa and an interior panel piece from an aircraft cabin found on Rodrigues Island off Mauritius were almost certainly from Flight 370. Those parts were the fourth and fifth pieces of the plane that have been recovered since it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.An extensive underwater search of a vast area of the Indian Ocean off Australia\u2019s west coast has turned up empty, with crews expected to complete their sweep of the search zone by July or August. Crews have less than 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 square miles) of the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) search area left to scour, and there are no plans to extend the hunt beyond that.Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, acknowledged it is looking less likely that Flight 370 will be found as the search nears the end.\u201cThat\u2019s just a statement of the obvious,\u201d said Dolan, whose agency is heading up the search effort. \u201cWe\u2019ve covered a fairly significant proportion of our total search area without finding the aircraft and so we have to start considering the alternatives. But we\u2019ve still got 15,000 square kilometres to go \u2013 which is a big chunk. \u2026 So it\u2019s not as though we\u2019ve given up.\u201d\u2014Associated Press writer Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, contributed to this report.', u'Body of Dutch climber recovered from Mount EverestKATHMANDU, Nepal \u2013 A helicopter has retrieved the body of a Dutch climber who died last week on Mount Everest while attempts were being made to retrieve the bodies of two other climbers.The body of Eric Arnold of Rotterdam was flown from Everest directly to a hospital in Kathmandu on Thursday to be put in the morgue. He died Friday night near South Col after showing signs of altitude sickness.Attempts were being made to retrieve the bodies of an Australian and an Indian climber but it was unclear when they will be brought to Kathmandu.Five climbers have died and two are missing on Everest, while nearly 400 have scaled the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) peak this month.This year\u2019s busy climbing season follows two years of disasters that virtually emptied the mountain.', u'Nearly 1,000 killed in attacks on hospitals worldwide in 2 years: WHO reportWASHINGTON \u2013 Nearly 1,000 people have been killed worldwide in attacks on medical facilities in conflicts over the past two years in violation of humanitarian norms, the World Health Organization said in a report Thursday.The report highlighted an alarming disrespect for the protection of health care in wars by governments and armed groups, which has earned fierce condemnation from human rights groups and doctors.The study by the Geneva-based WHO, the agency\u2019s most comprehensive study of such attacks around the globe, detailed 594 attacks on hospitals and clinics in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere in 2014 and 2015, which have left 959 medics, support staff, patients and visitors dead and over 1500 injured.Most disturbingly, the report states that over 60 per cent of the attacks deliberately targeted medical facilities, while 20 per cent were accidental and the rest were undetermined. Over 50 per cent of the attacks were perpetrated by governments, one-third by non-state armed groups and the rest were unknown.\u201cWe witness with alarming frequency a lack of respect for the sanctity of health care, for the right to health care and for international humanitarian law,\u201d the report said. \u201cPatients are shot in their hospitals beds, medical personnel are threatened, intimidated or attacked, hospitals are bombed.\u201dTargeting hospitals, doctors and patients constitutes a war crime, according to the Geneva Conventions. The U.N. Security Council has denounced the attacks and demanded that all parties in conflicts protect medical facilities, but some of the Council\u2019s most powerful members have themselves been associated with these crimes.U.S. forces struck a clinic in Afghanistan last year, killing 42 people, in what the Pentagon said was a mistake caused by human error. Medical facilities have also been hit by the U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Syrian President Bashar Assad and the Russian forces that back him have been accused of deliberately striking hospitals to make life in opposition-held areas unlivable.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely devastating breakdown of this long-held norm \u2014 protection and respect of health care,\u201d said Susannah Sirkin, a director at the New York-based Physician for Human Rights.In its report, WHO said it was important to continue documenting the attacks and the health effects they have on the communities where they are perpetrated. The agency also called for advocacy work on the international as well as local level to prevent such crimes.\u201cWe must ensure that health care is provided universally during emergencies to all those who need it, in safety, unhindered by violence or obstruction,\u201d the report said.', u'Police discover newborn baby in car following high-speed chase with suspectDramatic body cam and dash cam footage showed the moment a police officer found\xa0a baby in the back seat of a car following a high-speed chase with a suspect in Texas.Gerard Perry, 23, was arrested on May 21 for fleeing police during a routine traffic\xa0stop and then leading them on a chase.However, police weren\u2019t aware of a six-week-old baby inside of Perry\u2019s car until after the incident.According to , the infant was unharmed but was crying hysterically.He is now in the care of his grandmother.Perry, who was confirmed to be the father of the child, was arrested a short time later.Perry has been charged with assault on a peace officer, abandoning and endangering a child, as well as possession of marijuana and resisting arrest.', u'11 States sue Obama administration over transgender bathroom directiveAUSTIN, Texas \u2013 Texas and 10 other states are suing the Obama administration over its directive to U.S. public schools to let transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity.The lawsuit announced Wednesday includes Oklahoma, Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Maine, Arizona, Louisiana, Utah and Georgia. It asks a North Texas federal court to declare the directive unlawful in what ranks among the most co-ordinated and visible legal challenges by states over the socially divisive issue of bathroom rights for transgender persons.The Obama administration has \u201cconspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights,\u201d the lawsuit reads.Many of the conservative states involved had previously vowed defiance, calling the guidance a threat to safety while being accused of discrimination by supporters of transgender rights. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has previously said \u201cthere is no room in our schools for discrimination.\u201dThe White House had no comment on the lawsuit. The Justice Department said it would review the complaint and did not comment further.Texas\u2019 lieutenant governor has previously said the state is willing to forfeit $10 billion in federal education dollars rather than comply. The directive from the U.S. Justice and Education Departments represents an escalation in the fast-moving dispute over what is becoming the civil rights issue of the day.Pressed about whether he knew of any instances in which a child\u2019s safety had been threatened because of transgender bathroom rights, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of research\u201d during a news conference about the lawsuit. He said he his office has heard from concerned parents, but didn\u2019t say how many, and said he did not meet with any parents of transgender students before drafting the lawsuit.The states claim that the directive demands \u201cseismic changes\u201d in schools across the U.S. and forces them to let students choose a bathroom \u201cthat match their chosen \u2018gender identity\u2019 on any given day.\u201dTwo school districts joined the states in the lawsuit: one is the tiny Harrold school district in North Texas, which has roughly 100 students and passed a policy this week requiring students to use the bathroom based on the gender on their birth certificate. Superintendent David Thweatt said his schools have no transgender students to his knowledge but defended the district taking on the federal government.\u201cIt\u2019s not moot because it was thrusted upon us by the federal government,\u201d Thweatt said, \u201cor we were going to risk losing our federal funding.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tThe question of whether federal civil rights law protects transgender people has not been definitively answered by the courts and may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. But schools that refuse to comply could be hit with civil rights lawsuits from the government and could face a cutoff of federal aid to education.The guidance was issued after the Justice Department and North Carolina sued each other overs a state law that requires transgender people to use the public bathroom that corresponds to the sex on their birth certificate. The law applies to schools and many other places.Supporters say such measures are needed to protect women and children from sexual predators, while the Justice Department and others argue the threat is practically nonexistent and the law discriminatory.Education officials in Arizona said campuses already had policies to protect students from bullying and discrimination \u201cregardless of their gender identity.\u201d A small Arizona school district also joined in the lawsuit.\u201cThe fact that the federal government has yet again decided that it knows what is best for every one of our local communities is insulting and, quite frankly, intolerable,\u201d Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas said.___', u'Protesters clash with police outside Trump rally in CaliforniaANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A day after violent protesters outside a Donald Trump rally threw burning items at police and toppled barricades, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee railed against \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton and leaders in his own party who haven\u2019t yet endorsed him in a boisterous but less heated rally on Wednesday.Outside, demonstrators quietly held up signs reading \u2018Love and Peace\u201d and \u201cMigration is beautiful\u201d during the rally, but the modest crowd grew rowdier when Trump supporters came outside. The two sides shouted at each other as dozens of police, some on horseback, moved in to prevent a renewal of the violence that included rock-throwing and burning T-shirts Tuesday night in New Mexico.Five people were arrested as a line of police slowly moved scattered protesters along a nearby street.Inside, Trump\u2019s rally was interrupted several times by protesters who were escorted out of the Anaheim Convention Center, which was packed with thousands of Trump supporters.\u201cGet \u2019em out!\u201d he shouted at one point. \u201cOut! Out! Out!\u201d But Trump urged his supporters and security to handle his interrupters gently. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt \u2019em,\u201d he told them. \u201cI say that for the television cameras. Do not hurt him even though he\u2019s a bad person.\u201dLater, a pair of protesters in the stands behind the candidate ripped a Trump sign in half and made a rude gesture toward the crowd.As for Clinton, Trump noted Wednesday\u2019s report by the State Department inspector general that faulted her for her use of private email for official business when she was secretary of state.Trump said that he was eager to run against Clinton, but wondered aloud, as he often does, whether she would actually be the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee.Trump appeared to be making a concerted effort on Wednesday to tout his support with women. He met with a group of female business leaders ahead of the rally and invited several onstage. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, women do like me,\u201d he said.But later he went after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been vigorously criticizing him.\u201cShe gets nothing done, nothing passed. She\u2019s got a big mouth, and that\u2019s about it,\u201d he said of Warren. \u201cBut they use her because Hillary\u2019s trying to be very presidential. She\u2019s stopping with the shouting, OK?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I cannot listen to her,\u201d he added of Clinton.Trump\u2019s western swing comes as he works to unify a Republican Party that often remains skeptical of his candidacy. During the rally, Trump offered jabs at 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and former rival Jeb Bush, who have yet to endorse his candidacy.House Speaker Paul Ryan is still holding out on endorsing Trump even as his staff and other House Republicans and aides communicate increasingly closely with the Trump campaign on policy.Meeting with reporters Wednesday, Ryan shot down rumors that an endorsement was imminent. \u201cI don\u2019t have a timeline in my mind and I have not made a decision and nothing\u2019s changed from that perspective,\u201d he said.Later in the day his staff disclosed that Ryan planned to speak with Trump Wednesday evening by phone but insisted it was not about endorsing. \u201cThe purpose of the call tonight is for the two of them to continue their conversation about unifying the party,\u201d said spokesman Zack Roday.Before the Anaheim rally, police issued a firm warning to protesters that violence would not be tolerated following the clashes between anti-Trump protesters and police in New Mexico a day earlier.In one of the presidential campaign year\u2019s more unruly spectacles, anti-Trump protesters had thrown burning T-shirts, plastic bottles and other items at police officers, injuring several, and had toppled trash cans and barricades.Police responded by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades into the crowd outside the Albuquerque Convention Center.In Anaheim, pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators clashed last month at Anaheim City Hall when the City Council discussed a resolution criticizing Trump as divisive. Rally attendees arrived early Wednesday, weaving through a maze of police barricades and security checkpoints before entering the venue.The violence in New Mexico has prompted security concerns beyond neighboring California. Police in Bismarck, North Dakota, said Wednesday they would dedicate about a quarter of their force for security when Trump heads to the state Thursday.Sgt. Mark Buschena said about 30 officers would be assigned to the event at the Bismarck Civic Center. Trump is keynoting the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference and Expo, with about 7,000 people expected to attend.Trump was also scheduled to attend a TV taping and a fundraiser in the Los Angeles area Wednesday evening. He\u2019ll be back in California on Friday with visits to Fresno and San Diego.', u'Living with parents until mid 30s more common than everWASHINGTON \u2013 Many of America\u2019s young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.For the first time on record, living with parents is now the most common arrangement for people ages 18 to 34, an analysis of census data by the\xa0 has found.And the proportion of older millennials \u2014 those ages 25 to 34 \u2014 who are living at home has reached its highest point (19 per cent) on record, Pew analysts said.Nearly one-third of all American millennials live with their parents, slightly more than the proportion who live with a spouse or partner. It\u2019s the first time that living at home has outpaced living with a spouse for this age group since such record-keeping began in 1880.The remaining young adults are living alone, with other relatives, in college dorms, as roommates or under other circumstances.More than 40 per cent of Canadians aged 20 to 29 also lived at home with their parents at last count.The sharp shift across the continent reflects a long-running decline in marriage, amplified by the economic upheavals of the recession.The trend has been particularly evident among Americans who lack a college degree.The pattern may be a contributing factor in the sluggish growth of the U.S. economy, which depends heavily on consumer spending. With more young people living with their parents rather than on their own, fewer people need to buy appliances, furniture or cable subscriptions. The recovery from the 2008-09 recession has been hobbled by historically low levels of home construction and home ownership.Jennifer Post, 26, has been living with her parents in Villas, New Jersey, since dropping out of law school two years ago.A law career wasn\u2019t a good fit for her, Post decided, and now she\u2019s seeking a job in digital media or marketing. There aren\u2019t many opportunities in Villas, a beach town.Even living at home, she said it\u2019s been hard to save for a move to a bigger city after she was laid off from a baking job in March.Post spends her days on her laptop, sending resumes and refreshing LinkedIn and other job sites. To her parents, it looks as though she\u2019s slacking off.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a generation gap,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they literally think I just sit down and watch Netflix all day.\u201dAs recently as 2000, nearly 43 per cent of young adults ages 18 to 34 were married or living with a partner. By 2014, that proportion was just 31.6 per cent.In 2000, only 23 per cent of young adults were living with parents. In 2014, the figure reached 32.1 per cent.The proportion of young adults living with their parents is similar to the proportions that prevailed from 1880 through 1940, when the figure peaked, Pew found. Yet in those decades, the most common arrangement for young adults was living with a spouse rather than with parents.The typical U.S. woman now marries at 27.1 years old, the typical man at 29.2, according to census data. That\u2019s up from record lows of 20.1 for women and 22.5 for men in 1956.\u201cThey\u2019re concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children,\u201d Fry said.The shift may also be disrupting the housing market. One mystery that\u2019s confounded analysts is why there aren\u2019t more homes for sale. The lack of available houses has driven up prices and made it less affordable for many would-be purchasers to buy.Nela Richardson, chief economist at real estate brokerage Redfin, says one explanation for the sparse supply is that many baby boomers aren\u2019t able to sell their family homes and downsize for retirement because they still have adult children living with them. Redfin surveyed homeowners ages 55 to 64 and found that one-fifth still have adult children at home.Among young men, declining employment and falling wages are another factor keeping many 18-to-34-year-olds unmarried, Fry said. The share of young men with jobs fell to 71 per cent in 2014 from 84 per cent in 1960 \u2014 the year when the proportion of young adults living outside the home peaked.Incomes have fallen, too: Wages, adjusted for inflation, plunged 34 per cent for the typical young man from 2000 to 2014.Other factors contributing to more millennials living with parents range from rising apartment rents to heavy student-debt loads to longer periods in college.Many analysts had expected that as the economy improved, younger adults would increasingly move out on their own. That hasn\u2019t happened. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says soaring rents are discouraging some from leaving their parents\u2019 homes.Kolko\u2019s research has found that the share of young adults living with parents in the first quarter of 2016 was essentially unchanged from two years earlier.Median rents nationwide were surging at a 6 per cent annual pace as recently as August, though they have slowed since. In fast-growing cities like San Francisco, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, rents rose last year at a double-digit pace.Heavier student debt loads have sent more young people back to their parents\u2019 nests, according to research by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Other economists aren\u2019t convinced that student debt plays a dominant role. They note that the proportion of young adults without college degrees who live with parents is especially high: Nearly 39 per cent of those with only a high school degree were living with a parent in 2014, up from around 26 per cent in 2000.That compares with just 19 per cent of young adult college grads living at home in 2014. That figure, though, is up sharply from 11 per cent in 2000.Still, economists say most millennials appear to be delaying, rather than avoiding, marriage.Casey Marshella moved back in with her parents in Fairfield, Connecticut, after graduating from Boston University last year. Just this week, she moved into an apartment with her sister. Within weeks, she and a friend \u2014 who also lives with her parents \u2014 expect to find their own place.Marshella, 22, says living at home has helped her save money from her job as a human resources specialist. Because many people her age share the same circumstances, most sympathize with her.Still, Marshella says their first question is usually, \u201cSo when are you planning on moving out?\u201d', u'\u2018Some people are gay, get over it\u2019: Teen told pro-LGBTQ shirt violates school dress codeA 13-year-old Texas girl is speaking out after her school told her a pro-LGBTQ shirt she was wearing was a violation of the school\u2019s dress code policy.Eighth-grader Ali Chaney and her mother, Cassie Watson, believe the shirt reading \u201cSome people are gay, get over it,\u201d does not qualify as disruptive under the policy.\u201cI would never, ever have expected it from the administration,\u201d Watson Watson says she got a call this past Monday from her daughter, in tears after being sent to the principal\u2019s office at SC Lee Junior High School in Copperas Cove, Texas.Chaney, who identifies as homosexual, says school officials told her to change her shirt.\u201cIt\u2019s just a shirt, and it\u2019s not hurting anybody,\u201d Ali told KCEN News.But a spokesperson for the Copperas Cove Independent School District (CCISD) says the shirt fell under the district\u2019s policy against wearing \u201cdisruptive\u201d clothing.\u201cOur purpose at CCISD is to educate children, first and foremost,\u201d District Spokeswoman Wendy Sledd said in a statement. \u201cAccording to CCISD\u2019s dress code in the student handbook and code of conduct, clothing that is disruptive to the learning environment based on reactions by other students is prohibited.\u201dThe school board says Chaney was offered an alternative choice of clothing after being told her shirt\u2019s slogan was offensive.\u201cThe student was offered a school shirt to wear and declined,\u201d Sledd said.According to the  the dress code \u201cprohibits pictures, emblems, or writings on clothing (including bags/backpacks) that are lewd, offensive, vulgar, or obscene.\u201dIn addition, the handbook says school administrators have the final say over what constitutes \u201cdisturbing\u201d clothing.\u201cCampus administrators and faculty are charged with enforcing the dress code,\u201d the code reads.Yet Chaney says that policy is not enforced universally, showing a KCEN reporter a photo of another classmate wearing a shirt implying U.S. President Barack Obama is a Muslim Communist.In that case, Chaney says no disciplinary action was taken by the school despite the shirt\u2019s obvious political message.Cassie Watson says she\u2019s filed a complaint with the school board and is hopeful they will offer an apology to her daughter.', u'Seven-year-old with rare disease becomes a singing Internet sensationShe\u2019s a karaoke queen. Seven-year-old Audrey Nethery from Kentucky is taking the Internet by storm and has become a singing sensation with more than a million followers on Facebook.The little girl has become such a hit she even got to meet Taylor Swift.Nethery has a disease called Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. The disease is a bone marrow malfunction that fails to make enough red blood cells.on\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make as much blood cells as most people do. And it makes me a little bit short but that doesn\u2019t stop me from moving and acting,\u201d Nethery said.Nethery\u2019s parents started a Facebook page, , as a way to raise awareness for the disease.On the page they also share some of the more difficult moments, such as when Nethery has to go through a blood transfusion.But throughout all of this, the young Nethery keeps on singing and dancing.', 'Caught on camera: Smoking manhole cover explodes as Florida firefighters investigate blazeSt. Petersburg, Florida firefighters are lucky to have escaped serious injury on Tuesday after a manhole that was billowing smoke suddenly blew up.Video of the incident recorded firefighters responding to a call about a faulty transformer below the street, which was sending huge plumes of smoke rising from the sidewalk.Then without warning, a blast turned the smoke to fire at the same time a pair of firefighters walk by the manhole.Fortunately no one was injured in the explosion, but several nearby businesses were temporarily closed due to the incident.Electrical crews replaced the faulty transformer with a temporary one, though a permanent fix could take days.The electrical company says it could take multiple days to determine what caused the transformer to set fire and explode.', u'Canadian researcher hopes to prove exercise can be an anti-cancer \u2018drug\u2019A Canadian researcher is leading\xa0an international clinical trial that he hopes can change\xa0the way we treat cancer.The current focus is\xa0on advanced  patients who\u2019ve stopped responding to traditional treatments. The hope is to extend their life through a\xa0structured, high-intensity workout regimen.\u201cWe want to actually prove [exercise]\xa0does more than just makes you feel better and actually prolongs your survival,\u201d\xa0explained\xa0Dr. Fred Saad, a urologist-oncologist at the .Prostate cancer patients whose options have seemingly run out are encouraged to ask their doctors to join the randomized trial. It\u2019s already been launched in Australia and Ireland and is expected to run in at least 10 Canadian cities, including\xa0Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.Those\xa0who volunteer will be led through\xa0an hour of aerobic and resistance training three times a week, and compared against a control group who will only get general exercise\xa0recommendations.It\u2019s reportedly the\xa0largest\xa0research project to ever be\xa0funded by the \xa0and will cost an estimated $10 million.It\xa0builds on other Canadian research\xa0that\u2019s examined the benefits of a regular dose\xa0of exercise.A 2013 , for instance,\xa0found patients who did 60 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week\xa0had a lower risk of recurrence of the disease and a longer survival.This clinical trial will be the largest ever of its kind, Saad said, and the first to hopefully prove the link between exercise and cancer survival.Life-prolonging cancer drugs \u2014 which he said can cost $50,000 a year for one person\xa0\u2014\xa0can take a toll on patients, often making them lose their hair as well as\xa0causing pain and complications.Those chemotherapy side effects are thought to be lessened by\xa0exercise, as it\u2019s\xa0believed to strengthen bones and muscles.The roughly 100 international researchers working on this study\xa0figure if patients can tolerate more therapy through\xa0exercise, they\u2019ll ultimately live longer.Results won\u2019t be known for five years, so it\u2019s still too early to tell if the findings could be extended to other types of cancer.But \u201cresearchers are betting that exercise could well become the .\u201d', u'Finding a job is a major problem for military spouses: studyWASHINGTON \u2013 Military spouses struggle to find jobs and are more likely to work for less pay or in positions below their education level, spurring unemployment and other costs of as much as $1 billion a year, according to a study.Wrestling with frequent moves, deployments and erratic schedules of their service member mates, military spouses have an unemployment rate of up to 18 per cent, compared to last month\u2019s national jobless rate of 5 per cent.The problem is not new to the Pentagon, and in recent years has triggered a flood of new programs aimed at encouraging companies to hire military veterans and spouses.The latest study was commissioned by Blue Star Families, a group that co-ordinates services for families with a loved one who is currently serving or has served in the military. And it found that up to 42 per cent of military spouses \u2014 or as many as 95,000 \u2014 are jobless, compared to about 25 per cent of a comparable civilian spouse population. In addition, it estimated that military spouses with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn 40 per cent less than their civilian counterparts.The report noted that various groups have done studies on military spouse unemployment that yielded varying statistics. But there was broad agreement on the overall conclusion that they face higher unemployment rates than civilians, especially those of comparable age.\u201cThe math is shocking, but it also shows the way forward,\u201d said Kathy Roth-Douquet, founder and chief executive officer of Blue Star Families.And she called on the government and private companies to do more to battle spouse unemployment in the same way they did to beef up the hiring of veterans.\u201cMilitary spouses are faced with unique challenges in starting and maintaining a career as a result of the military lifestyle they lead that requires frequent moves and sometimes being the single parent while their military spouse is deployed,\u201d said Marine Lt. Col. Gabrielle Hermes, a Pentagon spokeswoman.Defence Department data from surveys comes up with different numbers, finding that 23 per cent of military spouses identify themselves as unemployed.According to the study, the estimated cost of the problem is largely borne by the federal government, including unemployment and health care benefits and lost income taxes. The study estimated that those costs ranged from about $710 million to $1.07 billion per year.There has been increased attention on veteran and military-related unemployment issues over the past decade, particularly as service members came home from repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and found it difficult to find jobs after they left the military. That focus has also expanded to spouses, who often find themselves moving every two or three years and often can\u2019t find jobs that are flexible enough to compensate for the long hours, absences and irregular schedules of their spouses while still meeting any child care needs.The study found that getting meaningful employment is a major concern for spouses. And more than half of them say that having a spouse in the military has a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on their ability to find a job that meets their education and experience levels.As of 2015, there were about 564,000 female civilian spouses of active duty military members nationwide, and 70 per cent of them were under the age of 35.The Pentagon and military services have a number of websites and jobs programs, including ones aimed at military spouses. The Military Spouse Employment Partnership has job listings, resume tips, career counselling and other assistance. According to the Defence Department, partner employers have posted more than 4 million jobs in the past five years.The Joining Forces initiative launched by First Lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden in 2011 has helped more than 1.2 million veterans and spouses get hired or trained, according to numbers announced earlier this month. Of those, Hermes said that about 95,000 were military spouses.Another program provides up to $4,000 in scholarships to eligible spouses to pursue certifications, licenses or other degrees.Hermes said that the department is assessing the effectiveness of the programs, adding that getting information about them can be a challenge especially when so many military spouses transition out of the military every year and new spouses join. She said the department relies on experts who work for the military services as well as other organizations, employers and communities, to help get the word out.', u'Trudeau to pitch Canada\u2019s new approach for boosting world economy at G7 summitISE, Japan \u2013 A group of powerful world leaders is about to hear a starkly new take on what Canada thinks must be done to revive the stagnant global economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will promote Canada\u2019s growth-boosting plan to his Group of Seven counterparts this week in Japan.Trudeau\u2019s theme: government investment is better than belt-tightening.This approach will sound different to G7 leaders than the message they likely heard from Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper.The ex-Conservative leader, who lost power to Trudeau\u2019s Liberals last fall, regularly called upon the global community to apply budgetary restraint.Trudeau\u2019s approach is expected to be well-received by most of his G7 peers at the two-day summit, which begins Thursday in Japan\u2019s Ise-Shima region.Most of the leaders have supported the use of fiscal tools to foster growth, but countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom are likely to stick to their cost-cutting approaches.One of Canada\u2019s closest G7 allies in the anti-austerity camp is Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who met with Trudeau and International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland on Tuesday in Tokyo.Japan, however, has a huge amount of debt compared to Canada and has been forced to try a combination of approaches to lift growth, including asset purchases or \u201cquantitative easing.\u201dThe situation is better in Canada, where the Liberals say low interest rates combined with the country\u2019s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio have created good borrowing conditions.As a result, they have committed to running years of budgetary deficits in order to double federal infrastructure spending over the next decade to $120 billion.\u201cCanada, at this meeting, will be speaking strongly on the side of investing in growth, rather than in favour of austerity,\u201d Freeland said.The government believes the G7, which also includes the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Germany, provides a good forum to share Canada\u2019s approach.Trudeau is scheduled to get one-on-one time Thursday with French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the sidelines of the summit.However, he likely will have a tough time persuading Merkel to make a big shift away from her cost-reducing stance.The G7 leaders will also discuss a range of other subjects, including security, refugees, health, climate change and the empowerment of women.Canada is expected to try to encourage G7 partners to join Ottawa in refusing to pay ransoms to kidnappers.The issue is of particular significance for Canada after militants in the Philippines beheaded Canadian hostage John Ridsdel last month. Ridsdel was kidnapped alongside fellow Canadian Robert Hall, who is still being held by the group.\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing a summit where there won\u2019t be a single, burning issue,\u201d John Kirton, director of the G8 Research Group at University of Toronto, said in a recent interview.Kirton believes U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s visit to Hiroshima is likely to attract the majority of the media attention away from the summit.Obama will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit the city, which was levelled by an atomic bomb during the Second World War.But Kenjiro Monji, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in a recent interview that the global economy will be the \u201cmain theme\u201d of the summit. He added it\u2019s very important the G7 strikes a strong message about growth.One expert said while the G7\u2019s anti-austerity camp holds the consensus, the challenge is finding a way for heavily indebted European countries to make that shift.Either way, G7 countries will closely watch how Trudeau\u2019s plan unfolds, said Matt Browne, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington.\u201cIt would not surprise me in the years to come that the example of Canada, should it prove to be successful, \u2026 would then indeed set an example for others to follow,\u201d said Browne, whose organization is run by high-ranking figures in Democratic politics.With the other leaders at the summit facing domestic hurdles, Browne said newcomer Trudeau and his relatively fresh slate are in a unique position.\u201cI think that allows him to be braver,\u201d he said when asked about the four years of majority government Trudeau has in front of him.Obama, meanwhile, is seen by many as a \u201clame-duck\u201d president as his final term nears its end.British Prime Minister David Cameron is swamped ahead of next month\u2019s vote on whether the United Kingdom should leave the European Union \u2013 the so-called Brexit.Browne said observers feel Hollande\u2019s presidency has been a disaster.In Germany, Merkel faces lower levels of growth than expected and the inability of the labour market to integrate refugees, he added.Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi must cope with one of the highest government debt loads in the European Union. Renzi has opposed Germany\u2019s austerity position, insisting that spending is the best way to boost growth.Abe also has to deal with a massive amount of public debt and a parliamentary election later this year, which will force him to postpone a planned hike in the national sales tax.', u'\u2018It was just pure grace\u2019: dog saved from euthanasia when vet finds paralyzing tickOllie the Sheltie\u2019s owners are calling it a miracle that their furry friend was saved from euthanasia when a paralyzing tick was discovered behind his ear.The Meteney family, from Portland, Ore., had returned from a camping trip earlier this month when 10-year-old Ollie became increasingly lethargic. According to the , Ollie was previously a healthy and active dog.The Meteneys took Ollie to their regular veterinarian who couldn\u2019t find a cause for his illness, despite conducting an array of tests.Ollie\u2019s health continued to deteriorate.He could no longer stand, walk, eat or \u201cdo his business\u201d\xa0on his own.They decided to put Ollie down.Veterinarian Dr. Adam Stone was preparing to put Ollie to sleep when veterinary student Neena Golden felt a strange lump behind the dog\u2019s ear.The lump turned out to be a tick that had latched onto the pup even\xa0though he was wearing a tick collar during the camping trip.Stone recalled a rare condition he had learned about in school but had never encountered before: tick paralysis.The  the condition occurs when a tick of a certain species secretes saliva into the dog\u2019s system over a prolonged period, causing paralysis.Instead of being put down, Ollie was sent home with his family to see if his condition would improve with the tick removed.\u201cThe next morning my mom opened the door and said, \u2018Look at your doggie,\u2019\u201d Falline Meteney told . \u201cHe comes walking up to me and I\u2019m barely awake and he just smiled at me.\u201dOllie was one minute away from being put down and the Meteneys are calling the incident a ', 'Six-month-old infant sets world record for youngest water-skiierVideo released by the World Barefoot Center in Florida shows Zyla St. Onge making two attempts to break the record for youngest water-skier.With a boost from several adults, Zyla skiied 62 feet last Friday. Doing so at the age of six months and 26 days.She made another attempt the next day, reaching 686.4 feet.The World Barefoot Center says that breaks a decades-old record held by Parks Bonifay, who skied at the age of six months and 29 days.', u'Billionaire Peter Thiel bankrolled Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker, reports sayST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2013 Is Hulk Hogan\u2019s courtroom cage match with  being bankrolled by a high-tech billionaire with a grudge against the news-and-gossip site?Two months after Hogan won a $140 million invasion-of-privacy verdict against Gawker for posting a sex tape of him, news reports say the pro wrestler is secretly backed by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook, was outed as gay by a Gawker-owned website in 2007, and the Gawker empire has run a number of stories skewering Facebook.On Wednesday, Hogan and Gawker were back in a Florida court, where Judge Pamela Campbell denied his request for a new trial and refused to reduce the damages. Gawker vows to take the case to an appeals court.Swirling in the background of the legal proceedings were reports in The New York Times and Forbes that Thiel is footing Hogan\u2019s legal bills against their common enemy, Gawker. The news stories cited unidentified sources.Thiel, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $2.7 billion, didn\u2019t immediately respond to interview requests made through email or on the voicemail of a mobile phone number he previously provided to an Associated Press reporter.Gawker reacted to the reports by saying: \u201cWe trust the appeals court will correct the outsized Florida jury verdict and reaffirm the law that protects a free and critical press, which is more embattled and important than ever.\u201dHogan\u2019s lawyers wouldn\u2019t comment on the Thiel story but praised the judge for denying a new trial and accused Gawker of refusing to accept responsibility for \u201ctheir reprehensible behaviour and method of doing what they call journalism.\u201dLegal experts say there is nothing illegal \u2013 or even unethical \u2013 about someone financing a lawsuit. There are entire companies that invest in contingency claims, usually in product liability, personal injury, patent infringement and copyright cases. It is called \u201clitigation financing.\u201dBut a billionaire doing it out of what may be spite? That\u2019s a little different, experts say.\u201cAs much as this is not at all illegal or unethical, it just smells and feels wrong,\u201d said Scott Greenfield, a New York lawyer who is managing editor of Fault Lines, an online legal magazine. \u201cWhen a rich guy can basically afford to bring down a media outlet, that has horrible social ramifications, even if the particular outfit is one that everybody hates, like Gawker.\u201dGawker is counting on the case to be overturned on appeal and has not said whether it can afford the full $140 million. During the trial, Gawker\u2019s parent company, a collection of websites called Gawker Media, was estimated to be worth $83 million.Earlier this month, Hogan sued Gawker again, saying the website leaked sealed court documents containing a transcript that quoted him making racist remarks. After the National Enquirer published the story, the WWE pro wrestling company severed its ties with Hogan. Gawker denies it leaked the transcript.In legal circles, attorney James Sammataro of Miami said people speculated how Hogan could afford such a large \u201cdream team\u201d of lawyers.Said Miami attorney Richard Wolfe: \u201cIt sounds to me that Hulk Hogan made a smart deal by getting the right guy to finance his lawsuit.\u201d', u'Penny-pinching restaurateur jailed after peanut allergy customer dies from \u2018no nuts\u2019 dishA British man was convicted of manslaughter after a customer at his Indian restaurant died because of a peanut allergy.Restaurant owner Mohammed Zaman, 53 was sentenced to six years in prison on Monday for the death of Paul Wilson, 38, a highly allergic bar manager who died after eating chicken tikka masala.Wilson had reportedly told the staff at Zaman\u2019s restaurant Indian Garden in North Yorkshire, England, about his allergy to peanuts.But police say despite ordering a nut-free meal \u2014\xa0the lid of the takeaway dish was clearly marked \u201cno nuts\u201d \u2014 it was\xa0later determined\xa0that the dish contained very high levels of peanuts.Prosecutors had argued that Wilson\u2019s death was the result of Zaman swapping out almond powder for a cheaper, peanut-based mix. The court heard that he even ignored another customer\u2019s near-death experience.Prosecutors say Zaman\u2019s conviction, the first of its kind in Britain, sets an example around the world: restaurant owners should be held accountable for not meeting allergy needs.\u201cPaul\u2019s death was avoidable and the outcome of this case sends a clear message to those who operate similar businesses that if they choose to operate in such a grossly negligent way, they are liable to prosecution as well as having to live with the potential deadly consequences,\u201d North Yorkshire Detective Shaun Page said in a Wilson was found dead on the bathroom floor by his roommate. He went into severe anaphylactic shock. The barely eaten curry dish was found on the kitchen table.Zaman had immigrated to England from Bangladesh at the age of 15 before getting into the restaurant business. Throughout his career, he\u2019s owned half a dozen award-winning Indian restaurants.His kids reportedly went to private schools and prestigious universities.But police say Zaman started pinching his pennies. He began employing undocumented workers and swapping ingredients with cheaper imitation ingredients to save money.Consequently, police say Zaman\u2019s cutting corners had led to the death of a man who was always extremely careful with his peanut allergy.', u'Female salamanders give up sex, end up better able to fend off predatorsAn ancient line of female salamanders has managed to do away with the need for mating with males, and has developed increased regenerative powers\xa0in the process.They may not be able to heal themselves instantly, but the salamanders show an increased capacity to grow back tails that have been lost to accidents or predators, according to a recent study .On average, their tails grew back 36 per cent faster than a normal salamander\u2019s after being chopped off. That\u2019s a huge competitive advantage as bigger animals\xa0look for a snack. The faster you can grow your tail back, the faster you can present it to a predator as an alternative to your head, or other important appendages.This all-female line of fast healers \u2014\xa0part of the broader species of Ambystoma salamanders native to large sections\xa0of\xa0North America including Canada \u2014\xa0is interesting even without its enhanced regeneration. Scientists have discovered that the animals reproduce themselves through cloning, effectively eliminating the need for any messy\xa0mating.Normally, cloning starts to become a problem after several generations because of the lack of fresh\xa0material in the gene pool. But this particular gang of ladies\xa0has been around for a very long time. They\u2019ve managed to evolve a unique mechanism to swipe\xa0DNA from \u201csperm packets\u201d deposited by males during the normal reproductive process.The unisexual amphibians are then able to use the stolen sperm to trigger an egg to divide, but it doesn\u2019t actually fertilize the egg, and may or may not contribute chromosomes to the offspring. In other words, the baby salamanders don\u2019t end up with any of the unwilling sperm donors\u2019 genes.Scientists have playfully dubbed it \u201csneaky sex,\u201d but the formal term is kleptogenesis.\xa0', 'Obama gives hip hop history lesson after Vietnamese rapper rhymes for himU.S. President Barack Obama completed a three-day trip to Vietnam with a town hall meeting in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday.As usual, Obama incorporated a question-and-answer session with the young leaders, which led to an impromptu performance by Vietnamese rapper Suboi.After she performed an a cappella verse, Suboi and Obama discussed gender stereotypes in music.The meeting involved about 800 young adults taking part in efforts to strengthen ties between the United States and Southeast Asia.In Vietnam, he met participants in the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.The initiative targets adults under the age of 35 in a variety of educational and cultural exchanges.Obama will shortly fly to Japan as part of a trip that will include the first visit to Hiroshima since the end of World War II by a sitting U.S. president.', u'State Department audit says Hillary Clinton violated email rulesWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton disregarded various State Department guidelines for avoiding cybersecurity risks, an internal audit found Wednesday, faulting her and past secretaries of state for weak information management.The inspector general\u2019s 78-page analysis, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, cites \u201clongstanding, systemic weaknesses\u201d related to the agency\u2019s communications. These started before Clinton\u2019s appointment as secretary of state, but her failures were singled out as more serious.Despite guidelines to the contrary and never seeking approval, Clinton used mobile devices to conduct official business on her personal email account and private server. She never sought approval from senior information officers, who would have refused the request because of security risks, the audit said.The review was prompted by the revelations of Clinton\u2019s email use, which has affected her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nevertheless, the review also encompassed the email and information practices of the last five secretaries.The report said the department and its secretaries were \u201cslow to recognize and to manage effectively the legal requirements and cybersecurity risks associated with electronic data communications, particularly as those risks pertain to its most senior leadership.\u201dClinton has been dogged by questions about her email practices for more than a year, since AP revealed that the clintonemail.com server was in the basement of Clinton\u2019s New York home while she served as the nation\u2019s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.Separately from the State Department audit, FBI agents have been probing whether Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server imperiled government secrets.Clinton has acknowledged in the campaign that her homebrew email setup was a mistake, but said she never sent or received anything marked classified at the time.', u'Caught on camera: Belgium police chief knocked out by protesterThe Brussels police chief was knocked unconscious on Tuesday during clashes at the end of a major anti-austerity demonstration attended by around 50,000 people in the center of the Belgian capital.Police chief Pierre Vandersmissen was treated for a head injury after he was hit with a stone in the back by a red-clad man and fell to the ground during rock throwing by a few dozen protesters after most of the marchers had already disbanded.With a pepper spray canister, Vandersmissen had been chasing people who had attacked police even though he was not wearing extensive protective gear.He was taken to hospital and is expected to be released on Wednesday.The demonstration was called to protest the center-right government\u2019s social and economic policies, which trade unions say cut deep into the foundations of Belgium\u2019s welfare state.', u'Captain America, Iron Man make surprise visit to teen battling cancer for the 2nd timeEL CAJON, Calif. \u2014 Each night, 18-year-old Ryan Wilcox sleeps under a portrait of himself dressed as Captain America \u2014 the pinnacle of human strength and endurance.The Marvel Comics fan knows a thing or two about those heroic attributes. He is battling cancer for a second time in his life, and so when he recently received some bad news about his prognosis, his schoolmates rallied and called in the Avengers.On Monday, the 67-pound teen answered his front door and was shocked at what he saw: Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. and Captain America Chris Evans had not only teamed up, they were with \u201cIron Man\u201d star Gwyneth Paltrow on a mission to lift his spirits.\u201cHey what\u2019s up buddy?\u201d Evans is heard as Wilcox shakes his head, doing a double take in a video taken by Paltrow. \u201cWe were in the neighborhood and thought we\u2019d cruise by.\u201d\u201cHey guys,\u201d says Wilcox, wearing a T-shirt featuring Captain America\u2019s shield.Paltrow, who plays Pepper Potts in the \u201cIron Man\u201d films, hugged Wilcox\u2019s mom, as the other two stars plopped down on the carpeted living room floor. They spent an hour at the home, conversing with the teenager, like they were old friends, his mom, Amy Wilcox, said.\u201cShe told me this is a gift from one mom to another mom,\u201d Amy Wilcox said. \u201cShe knew how happy it would be for me to see Ryan so happy.\u201dWearing a blue \u201cStark\u201d hat with Downey\u2019s autograph on the bill, Wilcox was still reveling Tuesday in what he described as the best day of his life.\u201cIt was really cool hanging out with them. That really picked me up,\u201d said Wilcox, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m going to get through this.\u201dCaptain America has been a symbol of strength for Ryan Wilcox. The film series has kept him going, keeping him distracted as he has undergone chemotherapy and bone marrow treatments during numerous hospital visits.Wilcox was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer at the age of 16. His mother said the cancer may be the result of chemotherapy treatments he underwent to fight a brain tumor at the age of three.He had a bone marrow transplant from his 14-year-old sister in April 2015, but he had a relapse in December of that year. In February, he had to leave school because his immune system was too weak, and last month the family was told the treatments are not working so far and his disease is progressing, his mother said.Thousands of students at Grossmont High School in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon held a rally two weeks ago, chanting \u201cRyan Strong.\u201d Scores were dressed in red, white and blue in honor of his favorite superhero. Then a group of students made a plea on Facebook for the cast of \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d to visit Wilcox.Evans responded within days of the posting with a video message telling Wilcox to \u201cstay strong.\u201dEvans on Monday signed the shield in the portrait of Wilcox dressed as Captain America above his bed. It reads: \u201cStay strong Brother!! Chris Evans. CAP.\u201d\xa0', u'\u2018Small, insecure moneygrubber\u2019: Sen. Elizabeth Warren blasts Donald TrumpBOSTON \u2014 More shots have been fired in the war of words between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump.The Massachusetts Democrat called the Republican presidential candidate a \u201csmall, insecure moneygrubber\u201d who doesn\u2019t care whom he hurts, as long as he can make money.Warren pointed to comments Trump said in 2007 that he\u2019s always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\u201cDonald Trump was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown because it meant he could buy up a bunch more property on the cheap,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhat kind of a man does that? Root for people to get thrown out on the street?\u201d\u201cPocahontas is at it again,\u201d Trump said in an email to The Associated Press in response to questions about Warren\u2019s remarks. \u201cShe scammed the people of Massachusetts and got into institutions because she said she is Native American. She\u2019s one of the least successful Senators in the U.S. Senate.\u201dDuring her 2012 election campaign, when she ousted incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown, Warren was criticized after being listed in law school directories as having Native American ancestry.Warren has dismissed similar criticism by Trump in the past as recycling what she described as \u201cBrown\u2019s hate-filled attacks on my family.\u201dThe comments by Warren on Tuesday before the Center for Popular Democracy in Washington are the latest in an ongoing battle between Warren and Trump. Earlier this month Warren took to Twitter to bash Trump for his treatment of women and comments he had made about her.During Tuesday\u2019s speech, Warren amplified that criticism.Warren, a hero to the liberal wing of the party, also faulted Trump for criticizing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that sought to overhaul the U.S. financial sector following the recession.\u201cDonald Trump is worried about helping poor little Wall Street? Let me find the world\u2019s smallest violin to play a sad, sad song,\u201d Warren said. She accused Trump of \u201ckissing the fannies of poor, misunderstood Wall Street bankers.\u201dShe also criticized Trump for saying he would not release his tax returns.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just a lousy businessman who doesn\u2019t want you to find out that he\u2019s worth a lot less money than he claims,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut we know one thing: the last time his taxes were made public, Donald Trump paid nothing \u2014 zero.\u201dTrump defended his private sector success.\u201cI borrowed $1 million dollars and turned it into a great $10 billion dollar company in a relatively short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf goofy Elizabeth Warren could do the same thing for the United States, which she can\u2019t, this country would be proud again.\u201d', u'How an 11-year-old boy, born deaf, became one of the top spellers in U.S.WASHINGTON \u2013 Making it to the Scripps National Spelling Bee is an amazing achievement for any kid, but for 11-year-old Neil Maes, being born deaf made his journey especially unlikely.After receiving cochlear implants in both ears as a baby, he had to train his brain to understand spoken words. It took countless hours of speech therapy.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even know that he\u2019d be able to talk. It wasn\u2019t a guarantee,\u201d his mother, Christy Maes, said Tuesday.Now the soft-spoken kid from Belton, South Carolina is officially one of the nation\u2019s top young spellers. He earned the right to take the stage with 281 others in Wednesday\u2019s preliminary rounds of the Scripps National Spelling Bee.The only assistance Neil requires is that the bee\u2019s pronouncer will speak into a microphone that transmits an FM signal directly into his cochlear implants. Similar to the technology he uses in school, it allows him to filter out background noise and focus on each word.Neil\u2019s parents have given him another tip, coaching him to always ask the pronouncer for the definition of a word, so that he can be sure he heard it correctly. Most contestants do this anyway.Peter and Christy Maes had no experience with deafness in their families. It turns out they\u2019re both carriers for a genetic mutation that causes hearing loss. Neil got his first implant at 11 months old. One of his two younger sisters was also born deaf, and has implants as well.\u201cMy goal was for him to meet his potential, no matter what it was,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt turned out to be pretty good!\u201dCochlear implants bypass the non-functioning parts of the ear by sending an electrical signal directly to the hearing nerve. While speech, music and other noises don\u2019t sound exactly like they do to a person with normal hearing, the brain can, over time, learn to process those sounds in a similar way, said Dr. Michael Hoa, a surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital who performs cochlear implantations.But these implants are merely a tool, the doctor said: Neil\u2019s intelligence and work ethic get credit for the rest.\u201cHe\u2019s able to handle very complex words. You tell him, \u2018Spell this word,\u2019 and he\u2019s able to actually visualize what that sounds like in his head and spell the word. It\u2019s actually quite impressive,\u201d Hoa said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into training your brain to do that.\u201dChristy Maes gave up her nursing job to help Neil through speech therapy. Now she works as a preschool teacher.She choked up several times when talking about her son\u2019s journey in an interview Tuesday at the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, a group that advocates for early intervention to help hearing-impaired kids.Neil\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know he was participating in a spelling bee with his third-grade class \u2013 until he came home and told them he had won. He made it all the way to his regional bee that year, finishing second. Now a fifth-grader, Neil is naturally shy and already worn out from the hectic bee-week schedule. He seemed happy to let his mom do most of the talking.\u201cOur main hope out of all of this was to encourage and inspire people that are going to be facing what we had to face,\u201d Christy said.But Neil said coming to the bee has motivated him to study even harder, so he can return next year.\u201cIt\u2019s just fun,\u201d Neil said, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve never been here before, and I just want to do it again.\u201d', u'Netanyahu shifts Israel further right, appoints ultranationalist defence ministerJERUSALEM \u2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached a deal to expand his coalition government on Wednesday by bringing in the ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu party and appointing its leader Avigdor Lieberman as his new defence minister.The development caps a tumultuous political week that began with Netanyahu negotiating with the moderate Labor Party against a backdrop of international pressure to relaunch peace efforts with the Palestinians, before choosing Lieberman\u2019s hawkish party instead.Lieberman is one of Israel\u2019s most polarizing politicians and has a reputation for making inflammatory statements. The Palestinian president\u2019s adviser promptly denounced the appointment, saying Lieberman was a \u201cfascist minister\u201d who will promote settlements.In a joint signing ceremony in Jerusalem, Netanyahu and Lieberman insisted they have put their past differences behind them and sought to soothe fears over their new alliance by making calming statements in both Hebrew and, with an eye toward the world, in English as well.\u201cI am committed to promoting the peace process. I am committed to make every effort to reach an agreement,\u201d Netanyahu said, noting that developments in the region have created new opportunities for peace.With the deal, Netanyahu expands his coalition to 66 of parliament\u2019s 120 members. He previously only had 61, the slimmest of majorities, which made it difficult to govern and legislate and opened him to potential extortion of any single lawmaker.Netanyahu also made another feeble plea for Labor to join his government. But it will almost certainly be rejected by a party that is deeply distrustful of Netanyahu\u2019s motives and currently engaged in bitter infighting over even negotiating with him in the first place.Lieberman will take over as defence chief in place for former military chief Moshe Yaalon, who resigned earlier this week following the political shakeup.Yaalon, like Netanyahu, is a security hawk who was deeply skeptical of peace prospects with the Palestinians and led the military through a 50-day war against Islamic militants in the Gaza Strip in 2014. At times, he angered the U.S. by criticizing American peace initiatives in the region as naive or messianic. But he was one of the Cabinet\u2019s more moderate voices and was fiercely protective of the military when it came under fire from ideologically-driven hardliners.His departure leaves the Cabinet dominated by religious and ultranationalist ministers who oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state and have close ties to the West Bank settler movement. Lieberman himself is a West Bank settler.In a three-decade political career, Lieberman has at times been Netanyahu\u2019s closest ally and at other times a fierce rival. While he is an experienced politician who has been foreign minister and held other top jobs, his security experience is limited.Over the years, Lieberman has made headlines for a series of incendiary comments. At one point, he called for bombing Egypt\u2019s Aswan Dam and suggested toppling the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Just a few weeks ago, he threatened to kill a Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip. He has repeatedly voiced skepticism about pursuing peace with the Palestinians.Those close to Lieberman, though, say he is far more pragmatic and level-headed in person than he appears in public and he seemed to be trying to convey that Wednesday.\u201cAll of us have commitments to peace, to the final status agreement, to understanding between us and our neighbours.\u201dSami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Islamic Hamas rulers, said all Israelis leaders are \u201ccriminals and killers\u201d and that appointing Lieberman signalled \u201cthe increasing extremism and racism in the Israeli occupation.\u201dHamas, which is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction, encouraged all other Palestinian faction to reject any \u201cillusion\u201d of normalization with Israel.Mohammed Shtayyeh, a political adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said Lieberman\u2019s addition to the government reflected an overall rightward tilt in Israeli society.\u201cI think that bringing a fascist minister who lives in a settlement, this is actually a manifestation of the settlement program,\u201d he said.\u201cAll what this Israeli government is interested in is to have more settlers, more settlements and totally shun away from the international effort to end occupation and conflict in the Palestinian territory,\u201d Shtayyeh added.', u'200-metre-long sinkhole along Florence\u2019s Arno River swallows dozens of carsFLORENCE, Italy \u2013 An underground water main break along Florence\u2019s picturesque Arno River has created a 200-metre-long sinkhole that buried dozens of parked cars.Firefighters asked residents of nearby palazzi to evacuate voluntarily, as there was no water or lighting in the area. Hours after the pre-dawn break, authorities were trying to determine Wednesday whether the weakened asphalt could withstand the weight of a crane to extract the waterlogged cars that fell into the hole.Mayor Dario Nardella stressed that the underground flooding was the result of a gash in a 60-centimetre (two-foot) diameter pipe, one of the major water conduits in the neighbourhood, and not a leak in the banks of the Arno. In a tweet he stressed that no one had been hurt in the collapse.The scene is near the famed Ponte Vecchio bridge, a favourite spot for tourists shopping for jewelry.', u'Baltimore police leader acknowledges flaws exposed by Freddie Gray caseBALTIMORE \u2013 The trial of an officer cleared in the arrest of a young black man who died from injuries suffered in police custody has exposed deep systemic problems within the Baltimore Police Department: Officers are inadequately trained and routinely ignore rules and regulations designed to keep people safe.The police commissioner acknowledged the failings Tuesday and announced a new program to help make sure officers read and understand general orders and policies. The announcement came less than 24 hours after a judge acquitted Officer Edward Nero of assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct charges in the arrest of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old man who died a week after being critically injured in a police van.In his verdict, Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams said Nero played little role in Gray\u2019s arrest and wasn\u2019t responsible for the failure to buckle him into the police van where he suffered a broken neck. Gray\u2019s death in April 2015 set off protests and rioting throughout the city.It was the second straight setback for prosecutors. A manslaughter trial for Officer William Porter ended in December with a hung jury. It also exposed troubles within the police department.Prosecutors plan to retry Porter in September. Prosecutors have not commented; they are under a gag order.Critics who believe prosecutors were overzealous with charges against six police officers say the state is using the individual officers as a way to indict an entire police department.\u201cThe benefit of this is, it\u2019s bringing attention to a real problem in policing: There are too many arrests and they lack probable cause, and individuals are stopped and frisked without reasonable suspicion,\u201d said David Jaros, an assistant law professor at the University of Baltimore. \u201cThe problem is, I don\u2019t think you use an individual to make that point.\u201dGray\u2019s neck was snapped sometime during a 45-minute ride in the back of police van, with his hands in cuffs and ankles in shackles.On Monday, Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams ruled that Nero, who was there when Gray was detained and placed in the wagon, was simply doing his job, even when he made a choice not to buckle Gray into a seat belt.Prosecutors tried to convince the judge that Nero was reckless for not buckling Gray in, an action required by an updated seat belt policy Nero\u2019s attorney insists the officer never read.The judge said his decision was influenced by a slew of witnesses who testified that Nero wasn\u2019t trained properly, and didn\u2019t understand the rules that applied to him. What\u2019s more, the judge said Nero was reasonable in believing that the wagon driver, or his immediate supervisor who was also on scene, would belt Gray before the van drove away.Among the witnesses was Sgt. Charles Sullivan, Nero\u2019s field training officer who told the judge that the policeman\u2019s hands-on training module was cut short for some reason, but couldn\u2019t explain why. He said he never trained Nero on prisoner transport policies even though it was required.Tessa Hill-Aston, the president of the Baltimore chapter for the NAACP, said after Nero\u2019s acquittal that the trial proved more than anything else the deep failings of the police department. But even so, she said it isn\u2019t enough for an officer to assume his supervisor will follow the rules.\u201cIt speaks to the lack of police knowing their own rules and regulations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt speaks to a lack of training, lack of protocol, lack of police officer being able to see that Freddie should have been buckled into the seat regardless of what their position is and who\u2019s in charge. That\u2019s where the system failed Freddie.\u201dDavis said Tuesday the new Power Document Management System, which will be rolled out July 1, will require officers to take quizzes based on information contained in general orders before signing their names at the bottom. Under the new system, officers who fail to review their policies could face administrative disciplinary measures.Davis added that the department is also updating its use of force policy for the first time since 2003.Asked if officers will now be unable to argue that they didn\u2019t read or understand a policy they failed to follow, he was unequivocal in his answer.', u'Ukrainian pilot Savchenko released by Russia: OfficialAccording to a tweet from Ukrainian\xa0President\xa0Petro Poroshenko, the plane carrying Ukrainian\xa0pilot Nadezhda Savchenko has\xa0landed.\u2014\u2014KIEV, Ukraine \u2013 An official in the Ukrainian presidential administration says Russia has released jailed pilot Nadezhda Savchenko and she is being flown to Ukraine, as part of a swap for two Russian servicemen imprisoned in Ukraine.The official spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.Kremlin-funded television station RT, , reported that two Russians also were released and are being flown to Moscow.According to the official Twitter account for the\xa0Presidential Administration of Ukraine, President\xa0Petro Poroshenko will make a statement to the media Wednesday; however, it\u2019s not yet clear if it\u2019s related to the reported release of\xa0Savchenko.Savchenko was captured in June 2014 while fighting with a Ukrainian volunteer battalion against Russia-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine.\xa0 for calling in co-ordinates for shelling that killed two Russian journalists in eastern Ukraine.

But severe damage or injuries are rare.In 1999, a strong earthquake near Athens killed 143 people, levelling some buildings and causing extensive damage to others.', u'Riot breaks out at Donald Trump rally in New MexicoALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2013 In one of the presidential campaign year\u2019s more grisly spectacles, protesters in New Mexico opposing Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy threw burning T-shirts, plastic bottles and other items at police officers, injuring several, and toppled trash cans and barricades.Police responded by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades into the crowd outside the Albuquerque Convention Center.During the rally, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, who shouted, held up banners and resisted removal by security officers.The banners included the messages \u201cTrump is Fascist\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve heard enough.\u201dTrump lashed back at protesters, tweeting Wednesday: \u201cThe protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!\u201dAt one point, a female protester was physically dragged from the stands by security. Other protesters scuffled with security as they resisted removal from the convention centre, which was packed with thousands of loud and cheering Trump supporters.Trump responded with his usual bluster, instructing security to remove the protesters and mocking their actions by telling them to \u201cGo home to mommy.\u201dHe responded to one demonstrator by asking, \u201cHow old is this kid?\u201d Then he provided his own answer: \u201cStill wearing diapers.\u201dTrump\u2019s supporters responded with chants of \u201cBuild that wall!\u201dTrump later tweeted \u201cGreat rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd!\u201dThe altercations left glass at the entrance of the convention centre smashed.Albuquerque attorney Doug Antoon said rocks were flying through the convention centre windows as he was leaving Tuesday night. Glass was breaking and landing near his feet.\u201cThis was not a protest, this was a riot. These are hate groups,\u201d he said of the demonstrators.Albuquerque police said several officers were treated for injuries after getting hit by rocks thrown by protesters. At least one person was arrested from the riot, police said.During the rally, protesters outside overran barricades and clashed with police in riot gear. They also burned T-shirts and other items labeled with Trump\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201dTuesday marked Trump\u2019s first stop in New Mexico, the nation\u2019s most Hispanic state. Gov. Susana Martinez, head of the Republican Governors Association and the nation\u2019s only Latina governor, has harshly criticized his remarks on immigrants and has attacked his proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The governor did not attend the rally and has yet to make an endorsement.Trump read off a series of negative statistics about the state, including an increase in the number of people on food stamps.\u201cWe have to get your governor to get going. She\u2019s got to do a better job, OK?\u201d he said, adding: \u201cHey, maybe I\u2019ll run for governor of New Mexico. I\u2019ll get this place going.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office fired back, saying Martinez has fought for welfare reform.\u201cThe potshots weren\u2019t about policy, they were about politics,\u201d said spokesman Michael Lonergan. \u201cAnd the Governor will not be bullied into supporting a candidate until she is convinced that candidate will fight for New Mexicans, and she did not hear that today.\u201dTrump supporters at the rally said they appreciated his stance on boosting border security and stemming the flow of people crossing the border illegally, but some said they were frightened by the violent protests outside.Karla Molinar, a University of New Mexico student, said she participated in disrupting Trump\u2019s speech because she felt he was attacking members of her family who are living in the country illegally. She said she believes Trump is using them as scapegoats for the nation\u2019s problems.Associated Press writer Susan Montoya Bryan contributed to this report from Albuquerque.', u'Scholar appointed successor after death of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar MansourKABUL \u2013 The Afghan Taliban confirmed on Wednesday that their leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in a U.S. drone strike last week and that they have appointed a successor \u2013 a scholar known for extremist views who is unlikely to back a peace process with Kabul.The announcement came as a suicide bomber struck a minibus carrying court employees in the Afghan capital, killing at least 11 people, an official said. The Taliban promptly claimed responsibility for the attack.In a statement sent to the media, the Taliban said their new leader is Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, one of Mansour\u2019s two deputies. The insurgent group said he was chosen at a meeting of Taliban leaders, which is believed to have taken place in Pakistan, but offered no other details.Mansour was killed in Pakistan on Saturday when his vehicle was struck by a U.S. drone plane, an attack believed to be the first time a Taliban leader was killed in such a way inside Pakistani territory.Pakistani authorities have been accused both by Kabul and the West of giving shelter and support to some Taliban leaders \u2013 an accusation that Islamabad denies. The insurgents have been fighting to overthrow the Kabul government since 2001, when their own Islamist regime was overthrown by the U.S. invasion.The United States and the Afghan government have said that Mansour had been an obstacle to a peace process, which ground to a halt when he refused to participate in talks with the Afghan government earlier this year. Instead, he intensified the war in Afghanistan, now in its 15th year.Mansour had officially led the Taliban since last summer, when the death of the movement\u2019s founder, the one-eyed Mullah Mohammad Omar became public. But he is believed to have run the movement in Mullah Omar\u2019s name for more than two years. The revelation of Mullah Omar\u2019s death and Mansour\u2019s deception led to widespread mistrust, with some senior Taliban leaders leaving the group to set up their own factions.Some of these rivals fought Mansour\u2019s men for land, mostly in the opium poppy-growing southern Taliban heartland.Senior Taliban figures have said Mansour\u2019s death could strengthen and unify the movement, as he was in some ways a divisive figure. The identity of his successor was expected to be an indication of the direction the insurgency would take, either toward peace or continued war.Akhundzada is a religious scholar who served as the Taliban\u2019s chief justice before his appointment as a deputy to Mansour. He is known for issuing public statements justifying the existence of the extremist Taliban, their war against the Afghan government and the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan. His views are regarded as hawkish, and he could be expected to continue in the aggressive footsteps of Mansour, at least in the early days of his leadership.He was close to Mullah Omar, who consulted with him on religious matters. A convincing orator, Akhunzada was born in Kandahar \u2013 the capital during the Taliban\u2019s 1996-2001 regime.A member of the Noorzai tribe, he is said to be aged around 50 years, and comes from a line of religious scholars. He leads a string of madrassas, or religious schools \u2013 figures in the Taliban say up to 10 \u2013 across Pakistan\u2019s southwestern Baluchistan province.A former foreign minister under the Taliban, Mullah Mohammad Ghous, told The Associated Press that the choice of Akhundzada was \u201ca very wise decision.\u201d Akhundzada was well respected among Taliban of all ranks, and could be a unifying force for the fractured movement, Ghous said.Wednesday\u2019s statement said two new deputies had also been appointed \u2013 both of whom had earlier been thought to be the main contenders for the top job.One of them is Sirajuddin Haqqani, who was also one of Mansour\u2019s deputies and who leads the notorious Haqqani network \u2013 the faction behind some of the most ferocious attacks in Afghanistan since the war began in 2001. The other is the son of Mullah Omar, Mullah Yaqoub, who controls the Taliban military commissions for 15 of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provinces.Akhundzada\u2019s appointment came as a surprise to some, including Ghous, who said that despite not being a top contender but a \u201cthird candidate,\u201d the new leader would rise above any personal animosity or conflict that might have arisen should either Haqqani or Yaqoub have been chosen.The Taliban statement called on all Muslims to mourn Mansour for three days, starting from Wednesday. It also attempted to calm any qualms among the rank and file by calling for unity and obedience to the new leader.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who took office in 2014, assiduously courted Pakistan in an effort to bring the Taliban into a dialogue that would lead to peace talks. Mansour, however, refused, choosing instead to intensify the war once the international combat mission drew down to a training and support role in 2015.In an unusual move, exiled Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who heads the militant Hezb-i-Islami group, offered condolences to Mansour\u2019s family, according to Mullah Hameedullah, a member of the Taliban\u2019s religious council.\u201cHekmatyar said he will offer prayers for Mullah Akhtar Mansour\u2019s soul,\u201d Hameedullah said.Hekmatyar \u2013 who is on U.S. and United Nations blacklists, as was Mansour \u2013 has agreed to a tentative peace deal with the Afghan government that could see him return to Kabul in the coming months. Officials and Hekmatyar\u2019s representatives have said that the truce, which is yet to be signed by the two parties, could serve as a template for a future deal with the Taliban to end the war.\u2014Associated Press writers Rahim Faiez in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this story.', u'11 dead after bomb explodes on minibus carrying court employees in KabulKABUL \u2013 A suicide bomber targeted a minibus carrying court employees in Kabul during morning rush hour Wednesday, killing 11 people, Afghan and UN official said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.The bomber, who was on foot, detonated his explosives\u2019 vest as he walked by the vehicle in the western part of the city, said Najib Danish, the Interior Ministry\u2019s deputy spokesman.The attack came as the Taliban named a new leader following the death of their former leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Saturday.The casualties in Wednesday\u2019s bombing included both court workers and civilians and the explosion also wounded four people, Danish said. The minibus belonged to the judiciary department in neighbouring Maidan Wardak province and was taking the workers there when it came under attack, he added.Within an hour of the assault, the Taliban, who often target government employees in their war against the state, claimed responsibility for the bombing. The claim came from Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, in an email sent to the media.\u201cThis attack was carried out as revenge for the killing of six innocent prisoners in Kabul,\u201d the statement said. It was a reference to the hanging early this month at a Kabul prison of six Taliban members convicted of terrorism.President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s office at the time said he had \u201capproved executions of six terrorists who perpetrated grave crimes against civilians and security personnel.\u201d The executions were the first approved by Ghani since he took office in 2014, promising to end the war. After the hanging, a Taliban statement accusing Kabul and the United States of torture, inhumane treatment and \u201ckillings under suspicious circumstances.\u201dThe suicide attack in Kabul was the second of its kind on the judiciary this month \u2013 a judge was gunned down by unknown attackers in Kabul earlier in May.The U.N. mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack.Since Jan. 1, UNAMA has verified 14 separate attacks targeting judges, prosecutors and judicial staff in Afghanistan, resulting in nine civilian deaths and 19 civilians wounded. Also, there have been four incidents of abduction of judicial staff. The Taliban claimed responsibility for seven of these incidents, said UNAMA.\u201cAttacks against judicial authorities are cowardly and contrary to international humanitarian law,\u201d said Nicholas Haysom, the chief of UNAMA, adding that the mission urges \u201cauthorities to do everything in their power to ensure adequate protection of judicial officials.\u201dThe last major attack in Kabul was on April 19, when a massive bomb killed 64 people and wounded hundreds. The Taliban also claimed that bombing.', u'Leaders at G7 summit in Japan to grapple with sluggish world economyTOKYO \u2013 Leaders of the Group of Seven rich nations will undoubtedly voice unity over fighting terrorism, pandemics and tax evasion at their summit in Japan this week. Finding a consensus on how to breathe life into their sluggish economies is proving more elusive.Aging workforces, sagging productivity and lingering damage from the 2008 financial crisis are complicating efforts to spur growth while the effects of the slowdown in China and the other big developing economies ripple across the globe.At a pre-summit meeting in northern Japan\u2019s Sendai, finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-7 failed to concur on a co-ordinated approach to fighting what Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz calls the \u201cGreat Malaise.\u201dThey did agree the world\u2019s growth engine is running on fumes: \u201cWe as the G-7 believe the biggest economic problem is demand. Demand \u2013 there is no demand \u2013 and that is the biggest problem around the world,\u201d said Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso.The reluctance of consumers to buy and businesses to invest, despite rock-bottom interest rates, has caught economists by surprise and policymakers flatfooted, as the IMF, World Bank and governments repeatedly have had to downgrade overly rosy forecasts.Last month, the IMF lowered the economic growth projection for 2016 and 2017 for the world\u2019s advanced economies, including Europe, the United States and Japan, where collectively growth has remained below 2 per cent since 2010.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult environment indeed,\u201d PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said last month in announcing a drop in her company\u2019s first-quarter sales and profits.When G-7 meetings began in the 1970s, Japan was in the midst of its post-World War II industrial boom. Growth peaked in the late 1980s, and has mostly stagnated since a massive stock market and lending bubble imploded in the early 1990s. It has continued to limp and languish despite massive public works spending and, more recently, a barrage of monetary stimulus.In Sendai, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and other officials said co-ordinating growth strategies was difficult given the varied challenges and resource constraints of each country.\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all,\u201d Lew said. Nonetheless, he made a point of urging Japan not to derail its faltering recovery with a sales tax hike planned for next year and cautioned Tokyo against intervening to drive the yen weaker for the sake of its exporters.The IMF says advanced economies could get a healthy economic payoff by investing in research and development, roads, bridges and other infrastructure, and to rewrite tax codes that discourage people from working.Instead, governments have tended to rely on central banks to keep interest rates low, or \u2013 in Japan and Europe \u2013 even negative.Meanwhile, some economists, notably Robert Gordon at Northwestern University, worry the world lacks the kinds of technological advances needed to drive up productivity and growth.Japan\u2019s population is shrinking and aging the fastest among G-7 countries, and its predicament is deepened by productivity that lags behind its G-7 peers.The country appeared poised for a revival, emerging from recession as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in late 2012, promising to \u201cbring Japan back\u201d with share price-plumping plans to fire up growth through government spending and a flood of stimulus from the central bank.The \u201cAbenomics\u201d three-pronged combination of monetary easing, government spending and structural reforms was supposed to end deflation and get households and businesses to spend more in the sort of \u201cvirtuous\u201d cycle all major economies have been striving for ever since the global financial crisis.The Bank of Japan\u2019s \u201cbig bazooka\u201d of monetary easing pumped trillions of dollars into the economy, helping to weaken the yen against the U.S. dollar as profits of big exporters like Toyota Motor Corp. soared.But Japan is still dipping in and out of recession, and a 2 per cent inflation target remains far beyond reach. Recent data show the outlook deteriorating, despite a 1.6 per cent uptick in annual growth in January-March.After more than three years, Abenomics is viewed mainly as a \u201cmarketing slogan,\u201d said Kenneth S. Courtis, chairman of Starfort Holdings and a former Asia vice chairman at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Japan needs to \u201ctake a blowtorch\u201d to regulations and red tape that discourage competition, he says.Most Japanese companies simply are not investing in their shrinking domestic market, even after the Bank of Japan pushed interest rates on some bank deposits it is holding below zero.The G-7 summit venue of Ise once was a centre for silk and cotton processing and shipbuilding. Today, its main industries are pearls, \u201cMatsuzaka\u201d fat-marbled beef and tourism.The region is picturesque but sparsely populated: Villages have been emptying out for decades as businesses, mines and entire communities were abandoned.Some were casualties of earlier shifts in the global market, as factories migrated to China and other developing countries.Stalling growth is not unique to rural Japan: Long-term economic growth in each of the G-7 countries is the worst it has been since the annual summits began 42 years ago, says Howard Rosen, an independent economist based in Washington.In the advanced economies, automation and online commerce have meant the disappearance of many skilled, high-wage jobs. To a growing extent, the meagre or unpredictable pay of service-sector and contract or part-time work is sapping consumers\u2019 purchasing power.As the usual policy tools fail, for the G-7 as a whole what prevails is uncertainty, said Dave Tilstone, president of the National Tooling and Machining Association.His group\u2019s members are showing \u201ca lot more hesitation, more than before, to make long-term commitments. Their customers just aren\u2019t getting those long-term contracts either,\u201d he said.Looming unknowns include the ups and downs of oil prices; whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again, possibly slowing the U.S. economy; whether Britain will opt to leave the European Union in a June 23 vote; and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, which could put Donald Trump in the White House.Europe is struggling with floods of refugees, as its banks, still holding bad debts left over from the financial crisis, remain wary of lending.Though Germany alone has kept its conservative stance toward spending, the other G-7 members have been constrained in varying degrees by law, politics and financial limitations from pursuing needed spending increases.\u201cYears ago, they came out with a co-ordinated growth plan and everyone kicked into gear,\u201d said Courtis. \u201cNow there are very different views and that\u2019s what\u2019s paralyzed the G-7.\u201d\u2014Wiseman reported from Washington.', u'8-month-old infant allegedly killed in shooting by father in St. LouisST. LOUIS \u2013 An 8-month-old boy was shot to death in his mother\u2019s arms Tuesday, and the suspected shooter \u2013 the boy\u2019s father \u2013 remained at large, St. Louis police said.The deadly shooting occurred shortly after 1 p.m. by an Interstate 270 exit ramp near the city limits, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said. The baby, Reign Crockett, was shot once as his mother attempted to escape a slowing car in which two other young sons were passengers, Dotson said. Police believe Diata R. Crockett, 34, was aiming at the mother, Dotson said.The victim\u2019s brothers, ages 2 and 3, were found unharmed several hours later at a family member\u2019s home in the St. Louis suburb of Bellefontaine Neighbors, near Ferguson.The mother flagged down a passing motorist who drove her and the infant to an area hospital as Crockett pursued them, Dotson said.According to Dotson, an 11-minute 911 conversation includes audio in which the unidentified Good Samaritan and the boy\u2019s mother, whose name was not released, can be heard saying: \u201cHe\u2019s trying to run us off the road. He\u2019s trying to cause an accident. He\u2019s following us.\u201dCrockett, whom police initially said was 35, remained at large Tuesday evening.

So you can imagine the magnitude of the loss,\u201d Kadua State Govenor Nasiru Ahmed El-Rufai said at a press conference on Monday.One billion naira is roughly $6.5 million Canadian.El-Rufai said officials have been sent to Kenya to learn how to deal with the pest.The loss of the crop is a devastating blow, because tomatoes are a staple food in the country.The price of the plant has risen dramatically: a basket of tomatoes, which had been US$1.20 three months ago is now more than US$40, the BBC reports.Kaduna state\u2019s agricultural commissioner, Manzo Daniel, puts the price even higher.A basket that contains around 100 tomatoes is going for 42,000 naira (US$212), he told AFP.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency calls the moth \u201chighly destructive.\u201dIt originated in South America, but has migrated to Africa and Europe, including Greece.Nigerians have taken their struggle online, where they are mocking Spain\u2019s La Tomatina, a festival that sees over 20,000 people join in a tomato fight.\u201cThey are throwing gold!\u201d one post reads.\xa0\xa0', u"Fiscal belt-tightening in Brazil as economic crisis loomsRIO DE JANEIRO \u2013 Brazil\u2019s acting president announced austerity measures Tuesday aimed at pulling Latin America\u2019s largest economy from its worst crisis in decades, warning that a failure to act will mean \u201cextraordinary hardship\u201d for future generations.Speaking with government leaders in a national televised meeting, interim President Michel Temer, 75, also banged his hand on the table while insisting he was up to the job.Temer said the government would get an early repayment of about $28 billion from Brazil\u2019s state-run investment bank BNDES and immediately abolish a fund created to channel oil revenues into education.He also pledged to limit annual growth in government spending to the rate of inflation, currently around 10 per cent.The most aggressive belt-tightening plans will depend on the Congress, and especially the Senate. Senators must vote in the coming months on whether to return suspended President Dilma Rousseff to office after an impeachment trial or permanently remove her. The latter would let Temer stay in the presidency through 2018.Temer, who was vice-president, took over this month after Rousseff was impeached by the Senate for allegedly using accounting tricks in managing the federal budget. Rousseff has argued she did nothing wrong and promises to fight permanent removal at her upcoming trial.Temer was vague about a timeline for introducing legislation on his \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d of reforming Brazil\u2019s pension system. Last week, he appointed a commission to study and negotiate changes. However, two of the country\u2019s largest unions have refused to participate, saying they don\u2019t recognize his government.Brazil\u2019s economy, an important engine for many South American nations, is expected to contract around 3 per cent this year after a fall of almost 4 per cent in 2015.Temer faces huge challenges to getting reforms through Congress. While many lawmakers rallied around the idea of impeaching Rousseff, agreeing on thorny reforms will likely prove much more difficult.In his first test with legislators, a divided Congress was still to vote on a new fiscal target for 2016, with a budget deficit of almost $48 billion. The previous figure under Rousseff was for a deficit of a little more than $27 billion. Lawmakers on both sides said there was a strong chance the vote would be postponed for next week.\u201cI have heard: \u2018Temer is very frail, poor thing, he cannot govern. Nonsense!'\u201d said Temer, whose normal mild manner has earned him the nickname \u201cbutler.\u201d \u201dI was public security secretary twice in Sao Paulo and I had to deal with criminals. I know what to do in government.\u201dHe said his administration has been a victim of \u201cpsychological aggression.\u201dAs acting president for less than two weeks, Temer has come under mounting criticism on several fronts, from his decision to appoint a Cabinet of all white men to unpopular ideas floated by his finance minister, such as raising taxes.Things got worse for the new administration Monday when Planning Minister Romero Juca took a leave of absence after a recording emerged in which Juca appears to be arguing that Rousseff had to be impeached to tamp down a sprawling investigation of a multibillion-dollar bribery and kickback scheme at state oil company Petrobras.Since Temer took office, unions, artists, politicians and students have protested against him. An ally-turned-enemy of Rousseff\u2019s, he is not popular. Opinion polls say many Brazilians would like to see him impeached, too. And the last time he faced the ballot box on his own, in 2006, he received the least votes among the candidates who won seats in the Chamber of Deputies.Also on Tuesday, Temer recreated the Culture Ministry after strong criticism from artists like Grammy Award winner Caetano Veloso and Oscar nominee Fernanda Montengro over his decision to fold the Culture Ministry into the Education Ministry.Temer has his work cut out for him in convincing average Brazilians that he can turn things around.The IBOPE institute on Tuesday published a poll saying only 31 per cent of Brazilians reported being \u201coptimistic\u201d or \u201cvery optimistic\u201d about Temer\u2019s prospects, while 34 per cent said they were \u201cpessimistic\u201d or \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d and 30 per cent reported feeling indifferent. Five per cent did not respond. The poll interviewed 2002 people between May 12 and May 16 and had a 2 percentage point margin of error.", u'John Oliver pokes fun at Chechen strongman\u2019s lost cat Instagram post. It didn\u2019t go over well.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov didn\u2019t take kindly to comedian John Oliver making fun of him for posting about his lost cat on Instagram.The 39-year-old, described as a \u201c\u201d ruler and repeatedly accused of violating human rights and cracking down on  and political dissent, has spent the past two weeks waiting for his tiger-like cat to come home.He  to make a public plea for any information about his feline companion.A translation of Kadyrov\u2019s Instagram post, via the , reads:The wayward feline is a toyger, short for \u201ctoy tiger.\u201d It\u2019s a , bred to look like a tiger.Oliver poked fun at Kadyrov Sunday night during the weekly broadcast of his HBO program .\u201cKadyrov being upset about his lost cat is not good. This is a man whose security forces have been accused of kidnappings and torture, and whose Wikipedia page has an entire section dedicated to accusations of human rights abuses,\u201d the comedian noted, before taking a couple of jabs at the content Kadyrov\u2019s Instagram account.\u201cIt\u2019s not just where he announced that he lost his cat, it\u2019s also where he keeps his 1.8 million followers updated with videos of his workout routine set to the finest European rave music,\u201d said Oliver before going on to describe Kadyrov as \u201ca can of Monster energy drink come to life.\u201dKadyrov\u2019s Instagram account is notorious: at times described as \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201c, his account has everything from pics of him wrestling in the snow and , to cuddling baby animals and posing with assault weapons.\u201cHonestly, I cannot recommend his Instagram account enough,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt almost makes you forget he was once  before executing him\u2026 Almost, but not quite.\u201dThat was a claim by Kadyrov\u2019s defector former bodyguard, Umar S. Israilov, made before  in 2009.Kadyrov was appointed leader of the Chechen Republic by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007.His close ties with Putin were also fodder for Oliver\u2019s jokes \u2013 something that wasn\u2019t all that hard to do given the ubiquity of Putin\u2019s visage on the account.The jabs pushed Kadyrov , in English no less, to hit back at Oliver and attempted to mock him.  Kadyrov posted an image of Oliver, with a Putin T-shirt photoshopped onto him, saying the comedian \u201cgot his wish to appear publicly in a T-shirt with an image of Putin, but not Obama.\u201d He heaped praise on the Russian president and criticized the U.S., accusing President Barack Obama of sparking deadly \u201cnew wars and bloody internal conflicts.\u201d As for his missing cat, he assured his followers that reports of the cat turning up everywhere from Iceland to New Zealand, and even the Oval Office, were false.', u'Japan\u2019s Prime Minister ups pressure on Trudeau over TPPTOKYO \u2013 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe upped the pressure Tuesday on Justin Trudeau by publicly suggesting his Canadian counterpart\u2019s positions had budged on a pair of prickly international files.Following a bilateral meeting with the visiting Canadian prime minister in Tokyo, Abe read a statement to reporters saying the two leaders shared \u201cserious concern\u201d about the territorial dispute that involved the \u201cbuilding of outposts\u201d in the South China Sea.Abe also said, through an interpreter, that Japan would continue to make efforts to seek early ratification of the controversial  treaty \u2014 \u201ctogether with Canada.\u201dBut Canada\u2019s interpretation of the meeting was somewhat different on those two issues.\t\t\t\n\t\tTrudeau initially made no mention of the contentious South China Sea dispute in remarks Tuesday that followed Abe\u2019s. As for the TPP, the government has made clear it is taking its time to review the 12-country Pacific Rim trade agreement before deciding to ratify.Japan is embroiled in an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea. China has been constructing islands despite the concerns of several Asian countries with territorial claims in the area.Last winter, Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida issued a statement confirming their commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in international maritime law.Without naming China, they also said they opposed the use of intimidation, force or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific.Late Tuesday, Trudeau spokeswoman Kate Purchase said in an email that \u201cthere is no change in our position on the South China Sea.\u201d She reiterated Canada\u2019s position, saying: \u201cAs we have said consistently, we believe in the rule of law and discourage any unilateral actions.\u201dKeio University law professor Masayuki Tadokoro said Abe may have been trying to \u201cextract\u201d extra support from Trudeau on an issue that represents a real security threat for the Japanese.\u201cAbe may have exaggerated the level of support he got out of the bilateral meeting for domestic consumption,\u201d said Tadokoro.Trudeau may have been trying to steer clear of the issue \u201cin the fear of undermining its relations with Chinese,\u201d he added.Tadokoro said while there\u2019s no way to know what Abe and Trudeau actually said to each other, \u201cit is not uncommon in diplomacy that things are deliberately left for convenient interpretations of both sides.\u201dKenjiro Monji, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in recent interview that on security issues Canada has long kept its attention toward Europe and the south because it is an Atlantic state.Monji said Canada is also a Pacific nation, but Canadians\u2019 renewed focus on Asia has primarily been through \u201ceconomic lenses.\u201dHe added that Japan has put a lot of importance on TPP and hopes to ratify it as soon as possible.Trudeau repeated his government\u2019s long-held position Tuesday that the TPP was still subject to a thorough, cross-country review.The TPP was negotiated by the former Conservative government and the Liberals have yet to signal whether they will ratify it.But the future of the TPP is in doubt. U.S. presidential hopefuls from both major parties have said they would reject the deal if elected.On Tuesday, Trudeau focused on boosting Canada\u2019s economic ties to Japan. He personally invited Japanese auto executives to invest more in Canada.\t\t\t\n\t\tBut it appeared his efforts in Tokyo wouldn\u2019t immediately secure concrete commitments from the auto industry.Trudeau met with parts manufacturers and the presidents of three auto companies: Honda, Toyota and Subaru.The CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries, the firm that makes Subaru, told Trudeau he doesn\u2019t have any plans to expand capacity in the near term, though he might in the future, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary Cameron Ahmad said after the meeting.There were no announcements of imminent deals with the others, either.\u201cI am very much in the relationship-building mode,\u201d Trudeau told a news conference in Tokyo when asked whether the meetings would yield firm results.As part of his pitch, the prime minister also told Yoshinaga that Canadians are innovative and focused on quality.He later described the meetings as \u201csuccessful.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, visited the Meiji Shrine, met with the emperor and empress of Japan and had dinner with Abe.Trudeau\u2019s Tokyo visit came ahead of the Group of Seven summit on Thursday and Friday in Japan\u2019s Ise-Shima region.', u'Canada not certain on joining anti-ISIS mission in Libya: VanceOTTAWA \u2013 Canada\u2019s top general says military intervention in Libya is not inevitable.Gen. Jonathan Vance, the chief of the defence staff, says he\u2019s not advocating one way or another for Canada to join a possible western military coalition in Libya.He says it is not inevitable that a new military mission will be needed to get rid of Islamic militants in Libya, but he\u2019s keeping a close watch so he can advise the government.\t\t\t\n\t\tVance says much will depend on the performance of Libya\u2019s new, United Nations-brokered government and what assistance it may ask for.Vance says the foothold gained by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya\u2019s port city of Sirte remains a serious impediment to stabilizing the country.But he says simply throwing military assets at the situation is not a solution on its own.', u'Mysterious letter to parents of missing person could help solve 1977 disappearance, police sayBernard \u201cBunny\u201d Ross Jr. was last seen leaving his home near Fort Kent, Maine in a state of emotional distress in 1977.He has been  and his whereabouts remained a mystery until his parents, Carol, 78, and Bernard Ross Sr., 80, received an anonymous letter a couple months ago at their home in Portland, Maine, from someone claiming to know\xa0where their\xa0son is.Police say if the letter is legitimate it could help solve the nearly four decade old missing person\u2019s case.\u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like this happen in my career,\u201d Maine State Police Lieutenant Troy Gardner told Gardner told the  that he reached out to the media in hopes that more stories might encourage the anonymous author to come forward.

While those reforms have allowed about half a million Cubans to start work in the private sector, the process has been slow and marked by periodic reversals. \t\t\t\n\t\tThe government has regularly cracked down on private businesses that flourish and compete with Cuba\u2019s chronically inefficient state monopolies. The latest backlash came after President Barack Obama met private business owners during his March 20-22 visit to Cuba, prompting hard-line communists to warn that the U.S. wants to turn entrepreneurs into a tool to overturn the island\u2019s socialist revolution.The Communist Party documents, published in a special tabloid sold at state newsstands Tuesday, said a category of small, mid-sized and \u201cmicro\u201d private business was being added to a master plan for social and economic development approved by last month\u2019s Cuban Communist Party Congress. The twice-a-decade meeting sets the direction for the single-party state for the coming five years.The 32-page party document published Tuesday is the first comprehensive accounting of the decisions taken by the party congress, which was closed to the public and international press. State media reported few details of the debate or decisions taken at the meeting but featured harsh rhetoric from leading officials about the continuing threat from U.S. imperialism and the dangers of international capitalism.That tough talk, it now appears, was accompanied by what could be a major step in Cuba\u2019s ongoing reform of its centrally planned economy.\u201cPrivate property in certain means of production contributes to employment, economic efficiency and well-being, in a context in which socialist property relationships predominate,\u201d reads one section of the \u201cConceptualization of the Cuban Economic and Social Model of Socialist Development.\u201dVanessa Arocha, a 56-year-old architect who makes hand-made purses and bags at home under a self-employed worker\u2019s license, said she dreamed of forming a legally recognized small business that could import supplies and machinery and hire neighbours looking for extra income.The government currently allows private enterprise by self-employed workers in several hundred job categories ranging from restaurant owner to hairdresser. Many of those workers have become de-facto small business owners employing other Cubans in enterprises providing vital stimulus to Cuba\u2019s stagnant centrally planned economy.The Cuban government blames the half-century-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba for strangling the island\u2019s economy. Cuba\u2019s new class of entrepreneurs say the embargo is a major obstacle but also lodges frequent, bitter complaints about the difficulties of running a business in a system that does not officially recognize them.Low-level officials often engage in crackdowns on successful businesses for supposed violations of the arcane rules on self-employment. And the government maintains a monopoly on imports and export that funnels badly needed products exclusively to state-run enterprises.Due to its dilapidated state-run economy, Cuba imports most of what it consumes, from rice to air conditioners. Most private businesses are forced to buy scarce supplies from state retail stores or on the black market, increasing the scarcity of basic goods and driving up prices for ordinary Cubans. Many entrepreneurs pay networks of \u201cmules\u201d to import goods in checked airline baggage, adding huge costs and delays.The latest change will almost certainly take months to become law. Such reforms typically require formal approval by Cuba\u2019s National Assembly, which meets only twice a year.\xa0', u'WATCH: India successfully tests mini space shuttleNEW DELHI \u2013 India has successfully tested its first small space shuttle as part of its efforts to make low-cost reusable spacecraft.The Indian Space Research Organization said the shuttle lifted off on a rocket from a launch pad in southern India on Monday and completed a successful 13-minute test flight.Space expert Pallava Bagla, who writes for science magazines, said the test paves the way for India to embark on low-cost space missions.

Richards and his climbing partner Adrian Ballinger shared images and videos of their journey on Snapchat, offering a firsthand glimpse at the beauty of a mountain with a deadly history. Four climbers have died on Everest in the past four days alone, According to the latest update on Snapchat, Richards began his descent from the summit of Everest early Tuesday. He made the entire journey without supplemental oxygen.Most climbers use supplemental oxygen due to the low levels of gas in the high-altitude air.Ballinger did not make it to the summit; he elected to turn around and begin using oxygen mid-way to the summit. But Richards isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. Many people become sick, some fatally, while making the descent from the summit.On Saturday, Australian Maria Strydom died after developing altitude sickness while descending the mountain. The 34-year-old climbed the mountain to prove that her vegan diet was enough to get her through the trek. In 2014, an avalanche killed 16 Sherpa guides near the base camp. Last year, another avalanche triggered by a powerful earthquake, killed 19 climbers and injured 16 others.', u'San Francisco home reno yields 120-year-old casket containing remains of toddlerA San Francisco construction crew renovating a house earlier this month was shocked to discover what is believed to be a 19th century casket containing the body of a three-year-old girl.Erika Karner was having renovations done in her garage, when a worker called telling her that they had discovered the girl, complete with skin, teeth and hair.\u201cHe said, \u2018do you have any idea what this is?\u2019\u201d Karner told . \u201cWe think it\u2019s a casket,\u201d the worker told Karner.The casket does not have a name or any other definable markings on it, making it difficult for officials to identify the girl.For now, Karner, who is living in Idaho while her house is under construction, has named the little girl \u201cMiranda.\u201dOfficials believe the casket was left behind when a local  more than 80 years ago.As San Francisco\u2019s population expanded in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the prime land became too valuable to house the city\u2019s dead.Between the 1920s and 40s, most of San Francisco\u2019s burial grounds were ordered out of the city, with the remains of more than 150,000 people moved south to the town of Colma.Today, Colma is made up of 1,600 living residents \u2013 and more than 1.5 million dead.Following the mass exhumation of San Francisco\u2019s graveyards, headstones made room for households, including Karner\u2019s home, which was built in 1936.But officials say many bodies were missed in the unearthing process and are often uncovered today during residential construction.The discoveries can leave homeowners wondering what to do with the remains.\u201cI was told to call a number of different agencies,\u201d said Karner. \u201cEveryone said, \u2018don\u2019t know what to tell you, but it\u2019s your responsibility.\u2019\u201dKarner said the city refused to reclaim the body, and would not issue her a burial permit to entomb the little girl without a death certificate.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get one, so that put us in a position of unfortunately having this individual in our backyard and feeling awful as a mom knowing this is a small child,\u201d said Karner.Karner contacted burial grounds in Colma, but was asked to pay US$7,000 to take the little girl.\u201cThis is somebody\u2019s child who was lovingly put to rest,\u201d said Elissa Davey, founder of .The organization, which provides burials for abandoned and unidentified children, has come to Karner\u2019s aid.\u201cThe coroner told Karner, \u2018It was a properly interred body\u2026this body belongs to [her],\u2019\u201d said Davey.But after the casket lay in limbo for 10 days in Karner\u2019s backyard Davey said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to help.\u201dDavey hopes donations will help provide the girl with a \u201cdignified burial\u201d and a new resting place in Colma in early June.\u201cOn her headstone it will read Miranda.\u201d', u'\u2018Like silent killers\u2019: Parents warn of window blind cords after toddler strangledParents of two-year-old toddler Bryan Saba who choked to death on a window-blind cord are urging other moms and dads to check their homes.Saba was playing in the living room last September when he got entangled in the looped cord of the window blind.\u201cI was afraid of the stairs, the bathroom and other things like the oven that Bryan could touch. The place we thought was the safest was where my son died,\u201d mother Maria Jose Saba said.The toddler\u2019s 16-year-old sister, who was babysitting at the time in their family home in Portadown, Ireland found Saba hanging from the cord.He was taken to hospital but died two weeks later from brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen reaching his brain.Now, at an inquest into his death, a coroner has issued a warning to parents and caregivers to remove the blind cords from homes in a bid to prevent similar incidents.\u201cAs coroner I don\u2019t want to hear another inquest into the death of child as a result of strangulation from a blind cord.\u201dThe court heard that Bryan was living with his father and four of his six siblings at the time of the tragedy.Bryan\u2019s parents are originally from Guinea-Bissau in West Africa but moved to Italy, then Northern Ireland at the start of 2015 for work.It is believed that the toddler, who was known for being adventurous and loving to play outside, climbed onto the couch and put his head through the loop.In Canada, regulations for corded window coverings require manufacturers to attach stop mechanisms meant to prevent the accidental strangulation of children.After Bryan\u2019s\xa0death, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) released  for parents and caregivers on blind cord safety:', u'Drunk driving convictions keep engineer off the road but not off busy rail lineNEW YORK \u2013 An engineer is operating trains along the third-largest commuter railroad in the United States, even though his driver\u2019s license has been suspended for 10 years because of a history of driving while intoxicated.New Jersey Transit engineer Thomas Broschart\u2019s license was suspended in 2007 for a decade, and he has someone pick him up from work because he isn\u2019t legally allowed to drive a car, according to an investigation by . But federal law doesn\u2019t require him to have a motor vehicle driver\u2019s license to operate a train.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a driver\u2019s license,\u201d Broschart said. \u201cOne has nothing to do with the other.\u201dNJ Transit said it\u2019s following the law but would welcome stricter regulations.\u201cFederal law governing engineers sets forth specific regulations in dealing with DWI cases involving engineers and we are obligated to follow those Federal Railroad Administration rules,\u201d NJ Transit said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe code was strictly adhered to and the engineer is certified to operate locomotives according to federal law.\u201dWhen asked whether his supervisors know that his driver\u2019s license was revoked, Broschart responded, \u201cAbsolutely. Everybody knows.\u201dIn 1995, Broschart\u2019s license was suspended for two years because he refused to have his blood-alcohol level tested, the TV station reported. In 1999, his license was suspended for a year for driving while intoxicated, and in 2001, his license was suspended for not complying with a mandatory alcohol program.U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez said it was \u201cpretty alarming\u201d that Broschart can transport commuters but can\u2019t legally drive to and from work. The New Jersey Democrat has asked his staff to contact the Federal Railroad Administration to determine whether a law needs to be changed.NJ Transit said, \u201cAnything that could be done to strengthen those federal rules and protect our customers and employees would be welcome.\u201d', u'Caught on camera: Police dashcam captures sudden collision with elkMontana Highway Patrol (MHP) released dashcam video from May 17 showing an officer colliding with an elk as it sprinted across a road.The video shows Trooper Dave Gleich travelling along a darkened highway near Great Falls, Mont., when an elk unexpectedly runs out onto the road.The animal is shown nearly being hit by an oncoming car, before Gleich plows into the elk with his cruiser.The car\u2019s airbag deployed and Gleich was able to escape the crash without injuries.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d another driver can be heard asking Gleich.\u201cYeah,\u201d responds Gleich. \u201cI think.\u201dMHP released the video as a reminder to drivers to always be on the lookout for wildlife while driving, and never swerve in an attempt to miss an animal.\u201cPlease always wear your seatbelt and never veer for deer,\u201d read MHP\u2019s  post.', u'Father pens touching letter to his transitioning sonA veteran political journalist in the United States says his daughter\u2019s transition from female\xa0to male hasn\u2019t been an easy road, but that he has come to accept and even embrace\xa0it.Jon Ralston, a contributing editor to Politico and the host ofon PBS, is using his public pulpit to share the very personal story of his son Jake\u2019s transition. Until recently, when Jake had the name on his birth certificate\xa0changed by a judge in Nevada, he was Madeline, or \u201cMaddy\u201d for short.\u201cI admit I sometimes still have a hard time with it all,\u201d Ralston wrote in\xa0\xa0that has since been shared widely on social media.He titled it simply \u201cThe child I love.\u201dBy the end of the post, Ralston begins\xa0referring to Jake as \u201che,\u201d reflecting his son\u2019s\xa0new identity. Ralston recalls\xa0Maddy\u2019s childhood, saying she always preferred dressing like a boy. After losing her mother and having to switch schools, however, he figured she was just going through a \u201cphase.\u201dBut the truth, he explains, was that he was the one in denial.In college, his now-son faced even more backlash, Ralston adds, and was\xa0told he is\xa0\u201can abomination of God,\u201d that his mother killed herself because she was ashamed of him, and that he is going to hell.As he prepares to meet Jake formally for the first time, Ralston said the political and moral debate raging in the United States over transgender rights is not top-of-mind.Speaking to\xa0, Jake said he is proud of his father\u2019s blog post and his willingness to share the family\u2019s story.', u'Donald Trump calls climate change a \u2018hoax\u2019, but is concerned it could ruin his golf courseWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump wants to build another huge wall, this time to keep out the rising seas threatening to swamp his luxury golf resort in Ireland.The Republican presidential candidate has called climate change a \u201ccon job\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d But in an application filed this month in County Clare, Ireland, the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel cites the threat of global warming in seeking a permit to build a nearly two-mile-long stone wall between it and the Atlantic Ocean. The beach in front of the 18th green is disappearing at a rate of about a yard each year.Trump\u2019s application, first reported Monday by Politico, cites local regulations pertaining to \u201crising sea levels and increased storm frequency and wave energy associated with global warming.\u201d An attached environmental impact statement says that almost all the dunes in western Ireland are retreating \u201cdue to sea level rise and increased Atlantic storminess.\u201dTrump campaign spokesman Alan Garten did not respond Monday to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.Trump, who has roiled the immigration debate by proposing to build a massive wall along the Mexican border, has repeatedly taken to Twitter to express skepticism that human activity is causing the world to warm, raising sea levels as the polar ice caps melt.He has also said he would seek to \u201crenegotiate\u201d the global accord to cut climate-warming carbon emissions agreed to by President Barack Obama in December.\u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2012.\u201cThe entire country is FREEZING \u2013 we desperately need a heavy dose of global warming, and fast! Ice caps size reaches all time high,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2014.Environmental groups pounced on the application as evidence of hypocrisy.\u201cDonald Trump clearly cares more about the fate of his golf courses than the health of the millions of families already affected by the climate crisis,\u201d said Adam Beitman, a spokesman for the Sierra Club.', u'What is turning the Taj Mahal green? Insect poo blamed for damaging historic monumentLUCKNOW, India \u2014 Swarms of insects breeding in a polluted river near the Taj Mahal are threatening the intricate marble inlay work at the 17th century monument to love by leaving green and black patches of waste on its walls, archaeological experts said Monday.Workers scrub the walls clean every day, but the regular scrubbing can damage the floral mosaics and shiny marble surface, said Bhuvan Vikram of the Archaeological Survey of India.\u201cA series of marble panels depicting plant motifs on the walls or reflective tiles used in this part of the monument are becoming disfigured,\u201d Vikram said.Authorities are looking for a permanent solution to the problem created by the insects from the genus Goeldichironomus, a type of elongated fly that resembles a mosquito, that is proliferating in the polluted Yamuna River. The river has stagnated to the point that it no longer supports fish that once kept the insects in check, environmentalist Yogesh Sharma said.In addition, heavy algal growth and deposits of phosphorus from ash dumped by a nearby cremation ground \u201care the primary source of food for this particular species of insect,\u201d said Girish Maheshwari, who heads the Department of Entomology at St. John\u2019s College in the northern city of Agra.The highest elected official of the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the Taj Mahal is located, called the insect menace a matter of \u201cserious concern.\u201dThe Taj Mahal, one of India\u2019s most cherished tourist attractions, brings millions of visitors to Agra every year. Archeologists are also struggling to protect the monument from air pollution, which turns the marble yellow and brown.\u201cOfficials have been asked to investigate as why there is sudden increase in number of these insects and how to control their population,\u201d Uttar Pradesh state spokesman Navneet Sehgal said.The Taj Mahal was built by Mogul Emperor Shah Jahan between 1632 and 1654 for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and houses their graves and a mosque.', u'EgyptAir Flight MS804: Second Canadian victim in crash ID\u2019d as Toronto manA Toronto man, Medhat Tanious, has been identified as the second Canadian killed when EgyptAir\xa0 flight MS804 crashed while heading from Paris to Cairo last week.\u201cIt is with great sadness that we inform you of the departure of Mr. Medhat Tanious on May 19th 2016,\u201d the Coptic Orthodox church said in a  commemorating victims of the crash. \u201cOur prayers are with the all the families affected by the tragedy of Egypt Air flight MS804.\u201dAccording to multiple media reports a funeral for Tanious took place Monday at St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Markham, Ont. The church said he left behind a wife, and three daughters.His daughter Merna said her father had flown to France to surprise his youngest sister. He was en route to Cairo to visits his in-laws at the time of the crash, she added.\u201cHe had a heart of a child,\u201d Merna Tanious told the Canadian Press. \u201cHe loved unconditionally, and he had an unbelievable ability to forgive all people that did him wrong.\u201dMedhat lived most of\xa0his life in Egypt, his daughter said. He married\xa0his wife\xa0in 1988 and the couple began raising their three girls there before immigrating to Canada in 2004.\u201cHe brought us here to try and give us the best life possible, and that\u2019s what he did every single day,\u201d she said.Last week, EgyptAir confirmed that another Canadian, , was one of 66 people aboard the Paris to Cairo flight that crashed into the Mediterranean Sea in the early hours of May 19.\u201cOn behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims,\u201d Foreign Affairs Minister St\xe9phane Dion wrote in a statement Friday.Hamdy was born and raised in Saskatoon but moved to Egypt several years ago.

He said the Democratic Party faces a choice of becoming more inclusive or maintaining the status quo.\u201cI think if they make the right choice and open the doors to working-class people and young people and create the kind of dynamism that the Democratic Party needs, it\u2019s going to be messy,\u201d Sanders said.Asked if the convention could be problematical, Sanders said: \u201cSo what? Democracy is messy. Every day my life is messy. But if you want everything to be quiet and orderly and allow, you know, just things to proceed without vigorous debate, that is not what democracy is about.\u201dSanders is vying for support ahead of California\u2019s June 7 primary, a day that also includes contests in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Clinton has 271 more pledged delegates than Sanders and is just 90 delegates shy of clinching the nomination when the total includes superdelegates, the party officials and elected leaders who can support the candidate of their choice.Some Democrats have grown weary about the length of the primaries, worried that it could give Republican businessman Donald Trump a head start on the general election and make it more difficult for Democrats to unite behind a nominee. The issue gained attention when a recent Nevada Democratic convention turned raucous.Sanders said he was \u201cbothered\u201d by the portrayal of the Las Vegas convention, saying it did not turn violent as some media reports indicated. \u201cThere was rowdyism. There was booing, I think inappropriately by the way,\u201d he said.The senator spoke after the Democratic National Committee announced a 15-member platform drafting committee, which will write the first draft of the party platform. The panel includes allies of both candidates.Sanders said the platform process would be an \u201cexcellent time to educate the American people,\u201d saying it would allow the party to have a vigorous debate over ways to address wealth inequality, the role of Wall Street in the economy, climate change and universal health care.He declined to entertain the possibility of being considered as Clinton\u2019s running mate, saying he was focused on winning the nomination. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, we will see what happens later on.\u201d But he reiterated that he would do \u201ceverything that I can\u201d to ensure that Trump is not elected president.Sanders said he had a \u201cshot\u201d at winning the California primary against Clinton and said, given his delegate deficit, it was \u201cimperative\u201d that he perform well. He estimated his rallies around the state would allow him to speak directly to 200,000 voters before the primary.\u201cWhat happens if I win a major victory in California? Will people say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re really enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton despite the fact that Bernie Sanders has now won whatever it may be, 25 states, half the states?'\u201d he said.If that happens, he added, superdelegates \u201cmay rethink that. That is why you want the process to play out.\u201dClinton\u2019s campaign said Monday she would not participate in a proposed California debate, choosing instead to campaign in the state. Sanders said at an evening rally in Santa Monica he was \u201cdisturbed but not surprised\u201d that Clinton had \u201cbacked out\u201d of the debate, which was part of an agreement the campaigns reached with the DNC earlier this year.Sanders also looked ahead to the future of his political movement, saying his goal was \u201cthe transformation of the Democratic Party. To be a party which is a grassroots party where the main energy comes from working families, from trade unionists, from environmentalists, from people today who want real political and social and economic and environmental changes in our society.\u201d", u'Invasion of bats forces Australian town to issue state of emergencyWork was underway on Tuesday to eradicate thousands of bats from the Australian town of Batemans Bay, in New South Wales, with local government officials labelling the situation as a \u201cstate of emergency,\u2019 local media reported.There are more than 100,000 bats that made their home in the coastal town south of Sydney, creating problems for local residents, according to local media.The New South Wales state government says it will commit about US $1.8 million to help the local council disperse the bats, known as grey-headed flying foxes.The bats are officially considered vulnerable species and their dispersing must be non-lethal, according to local media.Some of the ideas being considered are smoke, noise and clearing the vegetation, local media reported.Animal rights groups say this will not work and are calling for patience and time to enable to bats to move on.', u'Baltimore prosecutor criticized after 2nd cop acquitted in Freddie Gray deathBALTIMORE \u2013 After two trials and no convictions, Baltimore\u2019s top prosecutor faces criticism that she moved too quickly to file charges against six officers in the case involving a 25-year-old black man who died a week after he was critically injured in police custody, triggering protests and riots a year ago.Even the judge overseeing the cases \u2014 in his verdict Monday acquitting the latest officer to stand trial in the death of  \u2014 said the state failed to prove its case on any of the charges.Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams acquitted Officer Edward Nero of the assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment charges in connection with Gray\u2019s arrest outside a West Baltimore housing complex.Grey died on April 19, 2015, a week after his neck was broken while handcuffed, shackled, but left unrestrained by a seat belt in the back of a police van. The circumstances of his arrest and his death triggered protests demanding justice for Gray. On the day of his funeral, rioting and looting broke out. The National Guard responded, and a curfew was imposed.Nero, 30, who is white, was the second of six officers charged to stand trial. The manslaughter case against Officer William Porter ended in a mistrial when the jury deadlocked. Prosecutors plan to retry him in September.Williams delivered his verdict in the racially charged case before a packed courtroom Monday. Nero\u2019s parents and his brother sat in the front row; a few rows away, Gray\u2019s stepfather. Noticeably absent, however, was State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who was present when Williams declared a mistrial in the trial for Porter in December.After announcing charges against the officers last May \u2014 one day after receiving the police department\u2019s investigation while a tense city was still under curfew \u2014 Mosby did not shy from the spotlight. She posed for magazine photos, sat for TV interviews and even appeared onstage at a Prince concert in Gray\u2019s honour.After the acquittal, Nero\u2019s lawyers sought to send a strong message to her.\u201cOfficer Edward Nero, his wife and family are elated that this nightmare is finally over,\u201d wrote Marc Zayon and Allison Levine in a statement. \u201cThe state\u2019s attorney for Baltimore city rushed to charge him, as well as the other five officers, completely disregarding the facts of the case and the applicable law. His hope is that the state\u2019s attorney will reevaluate the remaining five officers\u2019 cases and dismiss their charges.\u201dMosby spokeswoman Rochelle Ritchie, citing a gag order in the case, declined comment.David Weinstein, a Florida attorney and former federal civil rights prosecutor, said the verdict will probably serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for prosecutors.\u201cThis speaks to the notion a lot of people had when this first happened, which is that it was a rush to judgment,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cThe state\u2019s attorney was trying to balance what she had with the public outcry and call to action given the climate in Baltimore and across the U.S. concerning policing, and I think she was overreaching.\u201dHarvard University professor Alan Dershowitz said he believed the judge\u2019s verdict was an example of the legal system looking at the facts of the case without being influenced by race or community pressure. He said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believed Mosby overreached in bringing charges against the six officers.\u201cThere\u2019s no question she acted irresponsibly,\u201d Dershowitz said in a telephone interview.Although the judge\u2019s ruling referred specifically to Nero\u2019s case \u2014 the other officers will be tried separately for their alleged roles \u2014 he rejected nearly every claim the state made at trial, repeatedly telling prosecutors they\u2019d failed to prove any of the counts beyond a reasonable doubt.Prosecutors had argued that Nero and colleague Garrett Miller illegally detained and arrested Gray without probable cause, and that Nero was reckless when he failed to buckle Gray into a seat belt during the van\u2019s second stop blocks from the arrest. Zayon argued Nero wasn\u2019t involved in Gray\u2019s arrest, having only arrived after Gray was in handcuffs. As for the seat belt, Zayon said not only was Nero unaware of a newly revised policy requiring officers to buckle in prisoners \u2014 the previous policy gave officers discretion based on circumstances \u2014 but that it was the van driver\u2019s responsibility to make sure Gray was safe.In his verdict, Williams said he believed Miller, who took the stand as the state\u2019s principal witness and testified that he alone detained and handcuffed Gray. The judge told prosecutors they failed to prove Nero did anything wrong.\u201cThe state\u2019s theory from the beginning has been one of negligence, recklessness, and disregard for duty and orders by this defendant,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere has been no information presented at this trial that the defendant intended for any crime to happen.\u201dWarren Brown, a Baltimore attorney who observed much of Nero\u2019s trial, said the verdict proved how thin the state\u2019s cases are against the officers.\u201cIt was clearly a case where the state decided that come hell or high water they were going to prosecute Nero and Miller, and I think that the ridiculous prosecution was borne out,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis thing may extend on and on, quite frankly. It\u2019s the prosecution that keeps on giving.\u201dTrial No. 3 \u2014 that of van driver Caesar Goodson, who prosecutors believe is most culpable in Gray\u2019s death \u2014 is set to begin in two weeks. He is charged with second-degree murder.___', u'Greece evacuates hundreds from Idomeni refugee campIDOMENI, Greece \u2013 Greek authorities sent hundreds of police into the country\u2019s largest informal refugee camp Tuesday to support the gradual of evacuation of the Idomeni site on the Macedonian border.The government has pledged that police will not use force, and says the operation is expected to last about a week to 10 days.By about midday 18 buses carrying a total 838 people had left Idomeni, heading to new refugee camps in northern Greece, police said. No violence was reported.Vicky Markolefa, a representative of the Doctors Without Borders charity, said the operation was proceeding \u201cvery smoothly\u201d and without incident. \u201cWe hope it will continue like that,\u201d she said.The camp, which sprang up at an informal pedestrian border crossing for refugees and migrants heading north to wealthier European nations, was home to an estimated 8,400 people \u2013 including hundreds of children \u2013 mostly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.At its peak, when Macedonia shut its border in March, the camp housed more than 14,000, but numbers have declined as people began accepting authorities\u2019 offers of alternative places to stay.In Idomeni, most have been living in small camping tents pitched in fields and along railroad tracks, while aid agencies have set up large marquee-style tents to help house people. Greek authorities have sent in cleaning crews regularly and have provided portable toilets, but conditions have been precarious at best, with heavy rain creating muddy ponds.Recently the camp had begun taking on an image of semi-permanence, with refugees setting up small makeshift shops selling everything from cooking utensils to falafel and bread.More than 54,000 refugees and migrants have been trapped in financially struggling Greece since countries further north shut their land borders to a massive flow of people escaping war and poverty at home. Nearly a million people have passed through Greece, the vast majority arriving on islands from the nearby Turkish coast.In March, the European Union reached an agreement with Turkey meant to stem the flow and reduce the number of people undertaking the perilous sea crossing to Greece, where many have died when their overcrowded, unseaworthy boats sank. Under the deal, anyone arriving clandestinely on Greek islands from the Turkish coast after March 18 faces deportation to Turkey unless they successfully apply for asylum in Greece.But few want to request asylum in the country, which has been struggling with a deep, six-year financial crisis that has left unemployment hovering at around 24 per cent.Journalists were barred from the camp during the evacuation operation. An estimated 700 police were participating in the operation.Greek authorities are also eager to reopen a railway line \u2013 the country\u2019s main freight train line to the Balkans \u2013 that runs through the camp and has been blocked by protesting camp residents since March 20.Anastassios Saxpelidis, a spokesman for Greek transport companies, said Tuesday that the 66-day closure has cost transporters about 6 million euros.Giorgos Kyritsis, a government spokesman on immigration, said the line should open \u201cin coming days.\u201dThe government has been trying for months to persuade people to leave Idomeni and go to organized camps. This week it said its campaign of voluntary evacuations was already working, with police reporting that eight buses carrying about 400 people left Idomeni Sunday. Others took taxis heading to Thessaloniki or a nearby town of Polycastro.On the eve of the evacuation operation, few at the camp appeared to welcome the news.Abdo Rajab, a 22-year-old refugee from Raqqa in Syria, has spent the past three months in Idomeni, and is considering paying smugglers to be sneaked into Germany.\u201cWe hear that tomorrow we will all go to camps,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, but my aim is not reach the camps but to go Germany.\u201d', u'Poland\u2019s PM, EU leader to discuss ending political crisisWARSAW, Poland \u2013 A senior European Union leader will meet with Poland\u2019s prime minister to discuss ways of solving a political crisis in the country that has strained ties with Brussels, the deputy foreign minister said Tuesday.Alarmed by government moves that have paralyzed Poland\u2019s constitutional Tribunal, the EU Commission has implemented the \u201crule of law\u201d procedure aimed at protecting EU values including respect for law, and has threatened sanctions.Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said Tuesday that recent talks have led to some understanding and paved the way for a meeting later in the day between Prime Minister Beata Szydlo and EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans, who said on Twitter he was to meet Szydlo in Warsaw.The EU has urged Poland\u2019s lawmakers to find a solution to the constitutional crisis that has divided the nation and led to massive street protests.The leader of the civic movement in defence of democracy, or KOD, Mateusz Kijowski, was meeting with EU Parliament leader Martin Schulz for talks on the situation in Poland.', u'China breaks Guinness World Record in \u2018mass plaza dancing\u2019BEIJING \u2013 China\u2019s dancing grannies have taken their moves to the record books.Guinness World Records says more than 31,000 Chinese participants have set a record for mass plaza dancing in multiple locations.It says on its website that 31,697 participants in Beijing, Shanghai and four other cities set the new mark on Saturday by performing choreographed dance moves together for more than five minutes.Participants in Beijing posed with Guinness representatives in front of the city\u2019s iconic Bird\u2019s Nest stadium.Generally middle-aged and elderly women, such dancers are a common site in parks, plazas and other public spaces in Chinese cities. While considered a healthy way to exercise and socialize, the performances have sometimes drawn criticism from those living nearby over the loud music accompanying the moves.', u'Hawaii could be first U.S. state to track gun owners in FBI databaseHONOLULU \u2013 Hawaii could become the first state in the United States to enter gun owners into an FBI database that will automatically notify police if an island resident is arrested anywhere else in the country.Most people entered in the \u201cRap Back\u201d database elsewhere in the U.S. are those in \u201cpositions of trust,\u201d such as school teachers and bus drivers, said Stephen Fischer of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information Services Division. Hawaii could be the first state to add gun owners.\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of us being entered into a database. It basically tells us that they know where the guns are, they can go grab them\u201d said Jerry Ilo, a firearm and hunting instructor for the state. \u201cWe get the feeling that Big Brother is watching us.\u201dSupporters say the law would make Hawaii a leader in safe gun laws. Allison Anderman, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the bill was \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d and that she hadn\u2019t heard of other states introducing similar measures.Sen. Will Espero, who introduced the bill, and the Honolulu Police Department said Hawaii could serve as a model for other states if it becomes the first to enact the law.Yet others say gun owners shouldn\u2019t have to be entered in a database to practice a constitutional right.\u201cYou\u2019re curtailing that right by requiring that a name be entered into a database without doing anything wrong,\u201d said Kenneth Lawson, faculty at the University of Hawaii\u2019s William S. Richardson School of Law.Legal experts say the bill could face challenges, but would probably hold up in court. Recent Supreme Court rulings have clarified states\u2019 ability to regulate gun sales, said David Levine, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.The bill will undergo a legal review process by departments including the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which supported the bill, before Gov. David Ige decides if he will sign it into law, said Cindy McMillan, a spokeswoman for the governor.The cost to enter names in the database will be covered by a fee paid by gun owners, which wasn\u2019t defined in the bill.Even though other states don\u2019t enter gun owners in the database, Honolulu Police Department Maj. Richard Robinson said it will still benefit Hawaii police. Right now, Hawaii gun owners undergo a background check only when they register a gun, so police have no way of knowing if they\u2019re disqualified from owning a gun in the future unless they try to register a new firearm.\u201cWe were only discovering things by accident,\u201d said Robinson, who helped draft the bill. \u201cThey happen to come register another firearm, we run another background check, and then we find out they\u2019re a prohibited person.\u201dThat happens about 20 times each year, he said.Some local gun owners say the law confirms their fear that the government would know exactly who and where people keep their firearms.\u201cThis is an extremely dangerous bill. Exercising a constitutional right is not inherently suspicious,\u201d said Amy Hunter for the National Rifle Association. \u201cHawaii will now be treating firearms as suspect and subject to constant monitoring.\u201d', u'EgyptAir Flight MS804: Human remains reveal explosion on board, official saysCAIRO -Human remains retrieved from the crash site of EgyptAir Flight 804 have burn marks and are very small in size, suggesting an explosion on board may have downed the aircraft in the east Mediterranean, a senior Egyptian forensics official said Tuesday.\u201cThe logical explanation is that an explosion brought it down,\u201d the official told The Associated Press.The official, who is part of the Egyptian team investigating the crash that killed all 66 people on board the flight from Paris to Cairo early last Thursday, has personally examined the remains at a Cairo morgue. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.However, the head of the government\u2019s forensic agency later Tuesday dismissed as speculation all media reports about human remains from the crash indicating an explosion.\u201cWhatever has been published is baseless and mere assumptions,\u201d Hisham Abdel-Hamid told Egypt\u2019s state MENA news agency.A statement from the government\u2019s investigative committee also warned media outlets to be cautious about what is published \u201cto avoid chaos and spreading false rumors and damaging the state\u2019s high interests and national security.\u201dThe Egyptian expert told the AP that all 80 pieces that have been brought to Cairo so far are very small. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even a whole body part, like an arm or a head,\u201d said the official, adding that one piece was the left part of a head.He said the body parts are \u201cso tiny\u201d and that at least one piece of a human arm has signs of burns \u2013 an indication it might have \u201cbelonged to a passenger sitting next to the explosion.\u201d\u201cBut I cannot say what caused the blast,\u201d he said. He did not say whether traces of explosives were found on the human remains retrieved so far.The expert\u2019s comments mark a new dramatic twist surrounding last week\u2019s crash, which still remains a mystery. The plane\u2019s black boxes have yet to be found and photographs of retrieved debris published by the Egyptian military over the weekend were not charred and appear to show no signs of fire.Egyptian officials have said they believe terrorism is a more likely explanation than equipment failure, or some other catastrophic event, and some aviation experts have said the erratic flight reported by the Greek defense minister suggests a bomb blast or a struggle in the cockpit.But so far no hard evidence has emerged on the cause of the disaster.Also Tuesday, the investigative team led by Ayman al-Moqadem issued its second report on the case, saying that so far pieces of the plane wreckage have been taken to Cairo in 18 batches. It added that the priority is to locate the black boxes and to retrieve more bodies.France\u2019s aviation accident investigation agency would not comment on anything involving the bodies or say whether any information has surfaced in the investigation to indicate an explosion.A French patrol boat took one doctor on board to help with searches when and if the body parts are found. But the French Navy said that if it finds debris and body parts, this would be first reported to Egyptian authorities and French justice officials.In a search for clues, family members of the victims gave been arriving during the day Tuesday at the Cairo morgue forensics\u2019 department to give DNA samples to help identify the remains of their kin, a security official said. The official also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.Also, a technical team from Egypt\u2019s forensic medicine department went to a hotel near the Cairo International Airport where relatives of the victims are gathered to take DNA samples to use in identifying the bodies.The EgyptAir crash shocked a nation struggling to revive its ailing economy and contain a resilient insurgency by Islamic militants.Safety onboard Egyptian aircraft and at the country\u2019s airports have been under close international scrutiny since a Russian airliner crashed in the Sinai Peninsula last October, killing all 224 people on board, shortly after taking off from an Egyptian resort. The crash \u2013 claimed by the Islamic State affiliate in Sinai and blamed by Moscow on an explosive device planted on board \u2013 decimated Egypt\u2019s lucrative tourism industry, which had already been battered by years of turmoil in the country.If mechanical or structural failure is found to be behind the crash of Flight 804, that would deal another severe blow to both tourism and the national carrier. If downed by an act of terror, the Egyptians can point to security at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, from which the plane took off.Egypt has dispatched a submarine to search for the flight\u2019s black boxes and a French ship joined the international effort to locate the wreckage and search for the plane\u2019s data recorders.Ships and planes from Britain, Cyprus, France, Greece and the United States are also taking part in the search for the debris from the aircraft, including the black boxes.', u'Suicide bombing killed 43 at Syrian hospital: WHOBEIRUT \u2013 A suicide bomber who targeted a hospital in a Syrian coastal city the previous day killed 43 people, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, as an activist group raised the overall death toll from the day\u2019s unprecedented wave of attacks on government strongholds to 154.Most of those killed in Monday\u2019s explosion at the Jableh National Hospital in the city of Jableh were patients and visiting family members, but three doctors and nurses were also among the dead, said WHO.The hospital, which was taking in victims from at least three other blasts that hit in the city on Monday \u2013 including one at a crowded bus station \u2013 was badly damaged and is no longer operational, WHO also said.The wave of bombings, claimed by the Islamic State group, struck in Jableh and the city of Tartus, also on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Both cities are government strongholds that have so far remained mostly immune to the violence of Syria\u2019s civil war, now in its sixth year.Syrian government officials said at least 80 died in Monday\u2019s devastating assaults, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict through a network of activists on the ground, said on Tuesday that 154 were killed.The attacks signified a major breach in the security of President Bashar Assad\u2019s coastal strongholds.The Islamic State group cast the attacks in starkly sectarian terms. A message attributed to the extremists that was circulated on social media said the bombings struck at the \u201chome of the Nusayris,\u201d a pejorative term for Assad\u2019s minority Alawite sect.However, Tartus and Jableh are both diverse cities, home to a sizable Sunni, Christian and Shiite population. The attacks targeted public spaces used by residents of all sects.The bombings sparked a reprisal attack on a camp for those internally displaced by war located in Tartus. Parts of the al-Karnak camp were burned down, according to Ghassan Hassan, who heads the Tartous2day media agency. Most of the 700,000 refugees in Tartus, from Syria\u2019s northern provinces, are Sunni.The coastal region has been the backdrop to some of the war\u2019s darker junctures, including twin massacres in Baniyas and Bayda, two formerly restive towns about 25 miles (40 kilometres) north of Tartus. Pro-government forces or militias summarily executed 248 civilians and looted and burned down Sunni neighbourhoods there in May 2013, according to Human Rights Watch. The New York-based monitoring group said the methods suggested that the attackers intended to drive the Sunni population out of the towns.Moderate and ultraconservative Sunnis now form the backbone of the rebel movement against the government in the surrounding regions.Syria\u2019s conflict, which began as a popular uprising against Assad\u2019s government in 2011, quickly descended into a full-blown civil war. Al-Qaida militants exploited the chaos to establish a foothold in the country, but the Sunni extremist group soon fractured, spawning the powerful Islamic State group. IS now controls a large swath of territory in the northeast and has proclaimed its self-styled \u201ccaliphate\u201d on territories it holds in Syria and Iraq. Al-Qaida remains a major player in Syria\u2019s conflict through its affiliate, the Nusra Front.', u'Trudeau tries to woo Japanese automakers ahead of G7 SummitTOKYO \u2013 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally invited Japanese auto executives Tuesday in Tokyo to invest more in Canada.But it\u2019s unclear whether he will secure concrete commitments from the companies on his first trip to Japan since taking office last fall.Trudeau met with auto parts manufacturers and the presidents of three auto companies: Honda, Toyota and Subaru.The CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries, the firm that makes Subaru, told Trudeau he doesn\u2019t have any plans to expand capacity in the near term, though he might in the future, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary Cameron Ahmad said after the meeting.\u201cThank you for agreeing to meet with us,\u201d Trudeau said to Yasuyuki Yoshinaga after they exchanged greetings at the residence of Canada\u2019s ambassador to Japan.\u201cI look forward to talking about tremendous opportunities to create success for Canada and for Japan through economic engagement.\u201dUnlike Toyota and Honda, Subaru does not have an operation in Canada.As part of his pitch, the prime minister also told Yoshinaga that Canadians are innovative and focused on high quality.Trudeau will also sit down Tuesday with his Japanese counterpart to discuss the countries\u2019 business ties as well as security co-operation before the Group of Seven summit later this week.His agenda for his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe includes issues like investment, education and trade, such as the huge 12-country treaty known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, visited the Meiji Shrine and will meet the emperor and empress of Japan before the prime minister sits down with Abe.For his part, Abe is expected to raise a pressing subject for the Japanese: regional security.Japan is deeply concerned about North Korea\u2019s recent nuclear tests and missile launches as well as an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea.Following their meeting in February, Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida issued a statement reconfirming their commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in international maritime law.Without naming China, they also said they opposed the use of intimidation, force or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific.When it comes to China, Keio University law professor Masayuki Tadokoro said Japan will listen carefully to Trudeau\u2019s words on the matter. The concern is Canada may not want to take very strong position due its economic interests in China.\u201cCanada has always been watching toward the east and south because Canada is an Atlantic state,\u201d Kenjiro Monji, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in an interview last week.\u201cCanada is also a Pacific nation and it is only recently that Canadians started to look to the west, but only through economic lenses.\u201dAbe is also expected to urge Trudeau to move quickly to open up Canadian liquefied natural gas exports to Japan.Japan, the world\u2019s biggest importer of LNG, is hoping Canada will issue necessary environmental permits to allow companies to export it from British Columbia.Monji said LNG is still very important energy source for his country, which makes Canada one of the most promising potential exporters to Japan. He noted that Japanese companies are involved in several LNG projects in Canada.Trudeau\u2019s Tokyo visit comes ahead of the G7 summit on Thursday and Friday in Ise-Shima.', u'5 dead after skydiving tour plane crashes in HawaiiHONOLULU \u2013 Five people died after a skydiving tour plane crashed and caught fire in Hawaii, one of two plane crashes reported Monday in the islands.It happened about 9:30 a.m. on the island of Kauai, the county fire department said. The pilot, two skydive instructors and two tandem jumpers were believed to be on the plane.Four of them were pronounced dead at the crash site, just outside Port Allen Airport. One man was taken to Wilcox Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.The group was believed to have been part of a tour operated by SkyDive Kauai, county firefighters said. The company offers tours from Port Allen.SkyDive Kauai is listed in state documents as a trade name for D & J Air Adventures, which FAA records identify as the registered owner of the aircraft.Company President David Timko said he didn\u2019t have any comment because the crash is under investigation. But he said he offers his condolences to the families of those killed.Kauai firefighters said the identities of the dead haven\u2019t been released.The National Transportation Safety Board will work with officials to determine the cause of the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration will also investigate.The plane was a single-engine Cessna 182H, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said. It\u2019s unclear what led to the crash.A few hours later Monday off the coast of the island of Oahu, emergency responders took one person to a nearby hospital after a small aircraft crashed in the water off Makaha Beach Park.County lifeguards brought two people to shore from a single engine aircraft that was about 30 yards off the coast, Honolulu Fire Department Capt. David Jenkins said.The other person in the airplane wasn\u2019t injured, Honolulu Emergency Services Department spokeswoman Shayne Enright said.State Department of Health data shows 20 visitors died in aircraft crashes in Hawaii from 2005 to 2014, including one skydiver. The others were killed in plane, helicopter and light sport aircraft crashes. Over the same period, 24 residents were killed in air crashes, including four skydivers.', u'Father angry after school lets substitute teacher take child home without permissionA Louisiana father is upset after his son\u2019s school allegedly allowed a substitute teacher to walk his child home without his permission.Christopher Johnson said on May 18 his five-year-old son missed his bus at J. F. Kennedy Elementary School that would normally take him home.However, instead of Johnson receiving a call from the school to let him know what happened, he said a substitute teacher walked his son home.According to KPLC, the teacher lives near\xa0the Johnsons.\u201cI can\u2019t even rationalize it because regardless of whether he lives close, or regardless of if he was a substitute teacher: he did not have any right to take my child from school,\u201d said Johnson to KPLC.Johnson also claimed the teacher left his son to roam the neighbourhood after no one answered the family\u2019s house door.He also said it was a \u201cbad 20 minutes\u2026 pacing back-and-forth\u201d asking for God to watch over his son because of the potential danger \u201cout there.\u201dThe boy was found at a neighbour\u2019s home a short time later.Now, Johnson and his wife want answers and an apology from the school.\u201cI would like for them to explain to me that this will never happen again, that this will definitely never happen again.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear who gave the substitute permission to take the boy home.The school board told KPLC they are aware of the incident and that it\u2019s currently under investigation.', u'Facebook still denies meddling with Trending Topics, but vows to make changes is taking steps to improve its Trending Topics section, after taking heat from conservative critics over claims it  to shut out right-leaning news topics. But the social networking juggernaut maintains there is \u201cno evidence of systematic political bias.\u201dIn , Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said it took swift action to address allegations it \u201c\u201d news stories and topics that might be of interest to conservative Facebook users while tampering with its algorithm to promote other topics that weren\u2019t necessarily trending.\u201cOur data analysis indicated that conservative and liberal topics are approved as trending topics at virtually identical rates,\u201d read the statement, following an internal investigation and a meeting last week between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and John Thune, chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee.The claims were first made in a May 9 article on the tech website  (an arm of Gawker media).Trending topics were introduced in 2014 and appear in a separate section to the right of the Facebook newsfeed. According to Facebook, potential trending topics are first determined by a software formula, or algorithm, that identifies topics that have spiked in popularity on the site.The Gizmodo article alleged the Trending Topics section \u201coperates like a traditional newsroom, reflecting the biases of its workers and the institutional imperatives of the corporation.\u201dGizmodo cited an anonymous former news curator who identified as \u201cpolitically conservative.\u201d The purported former employee reportedly said topics were elected \u201csubjectively\u201d depending on employee shifts.Facebook admitted it was possible there may be \u201cisolated improper actions or unintentional bias\u201d and, as such, would implement a number of improvements \u2014 including more employee training and greater oversight and review.Facebook also promised to cease relying on \u201clists of external websites and news outlets to identify, validate or assess the importance of particular topics.\u201d That lists also included several conservative-oriented media such as Fox News, the Daily Caller, the Drudge Report, the , and Beck\u2019s website The Blaze.In a letter to Senate Committee Chairman Thune, Stretch addressed specific content that Facebook allegedly sidelined, including posts about Romney, Cruz and Beck, as well as posts about late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle \u2014 the subject of the film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d.', u'Left-leaning candidate wins Austria presidency in tight raceVIENNA \u2013 A pro-European Union candidate eked out a victory Monday over a right-wing, anti-migrant rival to become Austria\u2019s next president, in a tight contest viewed Europe-wide as a proxy fight pitting the continent\u2019s political centre against its growingly strong populist and anti-establishment movements.European mainstream parties joined Austrian supporters of Alexander Van der Bellen in congratulating him on his victory over Norbert Hofer, with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier declaring. \u201cAll of Europe is now breathing more easily.\u201dBut with less than a percentage point separating the two, Hofer\u2019s Freedom Party and its allies across Europe also had reason to celebrate what they cast as a major political surge by one of their own.Hofer had been narrowly ahead of Van der Bellen, a Greens politician running as an independent, after the counting of votes directly cast on Sunday. But around 700,000 absentee ballots still remained to be tallied Monday, and those numbers swung the victory to Van der Bellen.Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said Van der Bellen collected 50.3 per cent of the votes compared with 49.7 per cent for Hofer of the Freedom Party. Only a little more than 31,000 votes separated the two, out of more than 4.6 million ballots cast.The results diminish the scenario that Austria\u2019s political landscape could immediately move away from its centrist political image through a new president who could oppose the government\u2019s EU-friendly policies and increase pressure for tighter migrant controls.Still, the narrow margin for Van der Bellen is the latest indication that Europe\u2019s anti-establishment parties are gaining influence.Hofer announced his defeat shortly before the official announcement in a Facebook post thanking his backers for their support.He acknowledged he is \u201cnaturally sad,\u201d adding: \u201cI would have been happy to have cared for our wonderful country as federal president.\u201d His post said that the work of his supporters during the election is \u201cnot lost but an investment in the future.\u201dWith the results close, Herbert Kickl, secretary general of Hofer\u2019s party, said it might demand a recount \u201cin case of significant signs of abuses\u201d during the absentee vote count. A Freedom Party meeting was called for Tuesday.\t\t\t\n\t\tHofer\u2019s Freedom Party has exploited anti-EU sentiment and fear that Austria could be overrun by refugees to become the country\u2019s most popular political force. Van der Bellen was generally supported by pro-European Union Austrians favouring humane immigration policies and others opposed to the right.Despite pledges by both candidates to be the president of all Austrians, the split vote revealed unprecedented polarization over which direction the nation should now take, particularly over migration and the EU\u2019s future. Van der Bellen sought to smooth over the differences in post-result comments.\u201cWe\u2019re equals,\u201d the 72-year old economist told reporters. It\u2019s two halves that define Austria \u2026 and together we make this beautiful Austria.\u201dBut one thing united Hofer and Van der Bellen despite their ideological differences. Both were protest candidates, mirroring the depth of Austrian dissatisfaction with the status quo. Contenders for the Social Democrats and the centrist People\u2019s Party \u2013 the two parties that form the government coalition \u2013 were eliminated in last month\u2019s first round of voting.Those parties have dominated Austrian politics since the end of Second World War and winners of all previous presidential elections since then have been backed by one of the two.Hofer\u2019s strong showing reflects the growth of support for anti-establishment parties across the continent to the detriment of the political middle. Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, a Social Democrat, described it as \u201ca continuation of a trend.\u201d\u201cPeople are dissatisfied with the traditional, standard political parties,\u201d he said on arrival at an EU foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels. \u201cI really believe it\u2019s time for us to reflect upon it because we must be doing something wrong.\u201dIn a tweet reflecting a collective sigh of European establishment relief, Czech Defence Minister Martin Stropnicky of the centrist ANO party hailed Van der Bellen\u2019s \u201cnarrow but for Europe important victory.\u201d German President Joachim Gauck described Van der Bellen as a \u201cconvinced European\u201d who wants to work for a \u201cstrong, steady, and in the long run stronger European Union.\u201dEurope\u2019s right, meanwhile, praised Hofer\u2019s close finish as a milestone on the path of international dominance for the right. France\u2019s National Front offered \u201cwarmest congratulations,\u201d adding \u201cThis historic performance certainly ensures future success for all patriotic movements, in Austria and elsewhere in the world.\u201dComments from Austria\u2019s foreign minister before the final tally was announced showed the government bracing for the worst in terms of international reaction had Hofer won.President Kurt Waldheim, who was backed by the centrist People\u2019s Party, already was boycotted by most of the world decades ago after revelations that he served in a German unit linked to atrocities in World War II. In Brussels, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz appealed \u201cto everyone to respect the results, totally independently from \u2026 whether they are happy with it or not, because this was a democratic Austrian election.\u201dHofer as president may have been unwelcome in some European capitals as governments there try to keep their populist Euroskeptic parties in check. And the Freedom Party\u2019s anti-Muslim campaigning also could have led to Mideast governments avoiding him.', u'Japanese pop star Mayu Tomita in coma following attack by obsessed fanJapanese pop star Mayu Tomita is in a coma in critical condition after being stabbed multiple times by an obsessed fan.Twenty-seven-year-old Tomohiro Iwazaki was arrested Monday on attempted murder charges. His attack on the popular singer was reportedly because Tomita refused a gift of his.Following his arrest,  reports Iwazaki confessed to the stabbing, telling police he \u201clost his temper.\u201dEarlier in the month Tomita had notified police about her attacker after he began posting threatening messages about her on social media.Tomita, a 20-year-old J-pop star previously in the\xa0group Secret Girls, was scheduled to perform that night in the same building in Tokyo. As of Monday evening she remained unresponsive in hospital from the stabbings to her neck and chest.In May 2014, two other J-pop stars in the group . Both bandmates survived and the attacker was sentenced to six years in prison.', u'5th grader allegedly chokes, beats up 6-year-old girl in school bathroomA six-year-old Georgia girl was sent to hospital on Thursday after allegedly being attacked by a fifth grader at her school.Cheryl Tackett, the mother of Lanira Ladewig-Watkins,\xa0said her daughter was \u201cviciously\u201d assaulted by an older student at \xa0Oakland Elementary School in Henry County.\u201cThe girl said she wanted to talk to my daughter,\u201d Tackett said. \u201cShe pulled her into the bathroom and proceeded with the attack.\u201dA first grade teacher at the school stopped the attack but found Lanira \u201clying bloodied on the floor.\u201d\u201cI just started crying,\u201d Tackett said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything but cry.\u201dEven though it\u2019s not yet known exactly why the unidentified fifth grader allegedly attacked Lanira, Tackett said it\u2019s not the first time her daughter\u2019s had trouble with the student.According to, Tackett had warned the school that the fifth grader was \u201cdangerous\u201d and had even threatened to beat her daughter up once when they were on a school bus coming home.The school district is aware of the incident but will only say there is a case going on involving \u201ctwo minors.\u201dTackett said every time her daughter tries to talk about the attack\xa0she gets \u201ctraumatized\u201d and now \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to go in bathrooms by herself.\u201dThe\xa0fifth grader had been charged in juvenile court on May 19.', u'Controversial Mexican-American textbook is stirring up cultural debate in TexasHOUSTON \u2013 A textbook proposed to help teach the cultural history of Mexican-Americans in Texas public schools is under scrutiny by scholars, some of whom decry the effort as racist and not a reflection of serious academic study.The textbook, titled \u201cMexican American Heritage,\u201d describes Mexican-Americans as people who \u201cadopted a revolutionary narrative that opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society.\u201d It also links Mexican-Americans to undocumented immigrants, saying illegal immigration has \u201ccaused a number of economic and security problems\u201d in the U.S. that include \u201cpoverty, drugs, crime, non-assimilation, and exploitation\u201dThe State Board of Education voted to include textbooks on Mexican-American studies after activists last year demanded the subject be formally included in state curriculum. \u201cMexican American Heritage\u201d is the first textbook on the subject included in a list of proposed instructional materials.\u201cParadoxically, we pressed for the board to include texts on Mexican-American studies, and we achieved it, but not in the way we were expecting,\u201d Tony Diaz, host of Nuestra Palabra (Our Word) radio program in Houston and director of Intercultural Initiatives at Lone Star College-North Harris, told the . \u201cInstead of a text that is respectful of the Mexican-American history, we have a book poorly written, racist, and prepared by non-experts.\u201dThe Texas Education Agency says it followed standard procedure for the call to submit instructional materials for Mexican-American curriculums for the 2017-2018 school year.Texans have until September to submit comments on the proposed instructional materials, said TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson. She also said the proposed textbooks will undergo review by a committee that includes teachers and administrators and that committee will make recommendations to the board.Ultimately, books adopted by the elected members of the Texas State Board of Education in November become part of the recommended instructional materials for statewide curriculums, but school districts aren\u2019t required to embrace them. Individual districts can use their state money to buy whatever textbooks they wish.The book \u201cis not a text that we have recommended nor we will be recommending,\u201d says Douglas Torres-Edwards, co-ordinator of a TEA-approved Mexican-American studies course that has been implemented in some Houston Independent School District schools. \u201cFrankly, that author is not recognized as someone who is part of the Mexican-American studies scholarship and most individuals engaged in scholarship will not recognize her as an author.\u201dThe book is produced by Momentum Instruction, a company that appears to be owned or operated by Cynthia Dunbar, a member of the Texas State Board of Education from 2007 to 2011. Dunbar, a right-wing Christian activist who questioned the constitutionality of public schools in 2008, labeled the education system \u201ctyrannical\u201d when she published her book, \u201cOne Nation Under God,\u201d while serving on the board.The Chronicle was unable to reach Dunbar or any of the books other authors. A phone message and email to Momentum Instruction from The Associated Press were not immediately returned Monday.The Texas Board of Education\u2019s members sanction textbooks for use statewide in a process that has for years been marred by ideological fights over lessons on subjects including evolution, climate change and the influence of biblical figures such as Moses on America\u2019s Founding Fathers.', u'Obama signs bill striking offensive terms from US lawsWASHINGTON \u2013 Federal laws will no longer include outdated and offensive terms used to describe minority groups.President Barack Obama signed a bill striking the several terms, including \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201cOriental\u201d on Friday, the White House said.Those terms will be replaced with \u201cAfrican American\u201d and \u201cAsian American.\u201dThe bill removing the terms passed the House in February and the Senate last week. No one in either chamber objected.The language targeted by the bill had appeared in laws dating to the 1970s that attempted to define minorities.In the Department of Energy Organization Act the phrases \u201ca Negro, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut\u201d will be replaced with \u201cAsian American, Native Hawaiian, a Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or an Alaska Native.\u201dThe same language changes will be made to the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976.', u'\u2018Arms race\u2019: LEGO toys have been getting more and more violentAre your child\u2019s toys more violent than the ones you remember?A new study from researchers in New Zealand suggests that LEGO toys have\xa0become more violent over the years.The study, published online in the, looked at all LEGO block sets sold since 1949, and found \u201csignificant exponential increases of violence over time.\u201dThe inclusion of weapons started slow, they said. The first weapons included were a sword, axe and lance in a castle set in 1979.But it spiked dramatically when the company began producing blasters to include with their Star Wars sets, introduced at around 2007.Now 30 per cent of all sets included a weapon.The increase in violent pieces in LEGO follows an increase of violent movies, the study says.\u201cCreators and producers of games and movies strive to push the limits of what violent media is allowed to be released to prevent their audience from getting bored of similar content,\u201d it reads.While exposure to violent video games and media has been linked to an increase of aggressive behaviour and a decrease of empathy in children, the same has not been proven for an exposure to violent toys.\u201cIn my experience as a psychiatrist, and as a parent, it really comes down to the context in which that weapon is being utilized and the guidance provided,\u201d\xa0, child psychiatrist\xa0and author of The Dolphin Parent, says.But there\u2019s another side of the issue she\u2019s worried about. She says branded LEGO sets that include weapons, like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, are taking some of the imagination out of playtime.\u201cInstead of having a nameless, faceless character that can do whatever the child imagines it can do, it\u2019s now Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader\u2026\u201cDarth Vader is always going to be evil and mean. So that takes the imagination away, and it also encourages the violence\u2026 because the character is so set.\u201d\xa0\xa0', u'Professor Angelina Jolie? Oscar winner to teach at London School of EconomicsHollywood actress and human rights campaigner  is set to make a foray into a new career path \u2014 university professor.The London School of Economics (LSE) has appointed the 40-year-old Oscar winner as a Visiting Professor in Practice at its Centre for Women, Peace and Security.\u201cI am looking forward to teaching and to learning from the students as well as to sharing my own experiences of working alongside governments and the United Nations,\u201d Jolie said  from the university Monday.Her appointment coincides with the inception of a one-year Masters of Science in Women Peace and Security and she\u2019ll join three other high profile visiting professor appointees: Jane Connors, Amnesty International\u2019s director of international advocacy; Madeline Rees, the secretary general of the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Security; and Lord William Hague, former U.K. foreign secretary.Jolie and Hague had a hand in the  \u2014 the first of academic centre of its kind in the U.K. \u2014 in February 2015, after having co-founded the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative in 2012.The new Master\u2019s program, according to the university, will offer courses on the role of women in peace and security, gender and militarization, and gender and human rights.\u201cBringing practitioners, policy makers and activists together with scholars is essential in advancing knowledge and influencing global and local policy-making,\u201d Christine Chinkin, the centre\u2019s director, said.Away from the big screen, Jolie has had a long relation with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees \u2014 serving as a Goodwill Ambassador from 2001 to 2012, when she was appointed as a Special Envoy for the refugee agency.She has addressed the UN Security council a number of times, visited camps for  displaced by war and natural disasters, and pressed world leaders for action on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.Jolie also wrote two columns in the  to raise awareness about the BRCA 1 gene \u2014 a genetic mutation that puts affected women at higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer \u2014 detailing how she underwent a  and had  to lessen her risk of one day getting cancer.', u'Hazardous chemicals force evacuation at Florida Planned Parenthood clinicSARASOTA, Fla. \u2013 Hazardous materials teams found unidentified chemicals inside cleaning closets at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Florida on Monday after the clinic sent seven staffers who were complaining of breathing problems to a hospital for evaluation, police and clinic officials said.A total of 42 people were evacuated at 10:45 a.m. and people were decontaminated at the scene, Sarasota Police Department spokeswoman Genevieve Judge said in a news release. At the moment, there is no criminal investigation, Judge said. Planned Parenthood spokesman Andrew Taverrite said no patients were onsite.The workers were expected to be allowed back into the clinic later Monday, Judge said.The clinic provides family planning services, preventive health care, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and abortions.Planned Parenthood is a national target because of its role as the largest U.S. abortion provider.Last year, edited videos were released purporting to show Planned Parenthood selling fetal tissue for profit. The organization has denied the allegation.Two anti-abortion activists were indicted in connection with making the videos.', u'\u2018You\u2019re the bravest little girl I\u2019ve ever known\u2019: Daughter receives letters from mom 23 years after deathA mother who knew she wouldn\u2019t always be there physically wrote letters of guidance and love to her daughter before dying of bone cancer. What she didn\u2019t know is that her letters would take 23 years to reach her.Two decades later, Amanda Lemmond received the old letters from her mother Barbara Jane Hyatt over the weekend at her home in Colorado.On Saturday, Lemmond received a package in the mail from the executor of her mother\u2019s estate.The executor recently moved and came across boxes belonging to Lemmond\u2019s mother. Inside were letters, photos and mementoes from Lemmond\u2019s childhood \u2013 even her original birth certificate.For the longest time, Lemmond said she didn\u2019t have much of her mother to hold onto.Lemmond never knew the letters existed. They were written by her mother just a month before she died. \u201cIt\u2019s a connection to her that I never thought I\u2019d have again.\u201dLemmond said she hopes to digitize the letters and put the original copies in a scrapbook that she\u2019ll be able to share with her family.\u201cThey\u2019re messages of love and hope and inspiration,\u201d Lemmond said.', u'Gay men\u2019s choir silenced by San Diego Padres during anthem singing on LGBT Pride nightSAN DIEGO \u2013 The San Diego Gay Men\u2019s Chorus is criticizing the San Diego Padres for mishandling the group\u2019s scheduled performance of the national anthem.The chorus said on its  that 100 of its members gathered to perform the song before the game Saturday against the Los Angeles Dodgers when the Padres instead played the recorded voice of a woman singing the anthem. Their statement said no attempt was made to stop the recording and that the group received \u201chomophobic taunts\u201d while being escorted off the field.The group claims at least one fan yelled, \u201cYou sing like a girl,\u201d as they left the diamond.Chorus members called for the Padres and Major League Baseball to investigate whether anyone intentionally played a woman\u2019s voice \u201cwith the purpose of denigrating and/or ridiculing gay men.\u201dThe Padres issued a statement Saturday night saying a mistake was made that prevented the chorus from performing and that \u201cwe apologize to anyone in the ballpark who this may have offended.\u201dThe Padres said they\u2019d reached out to the chorus \u201cto express our deep regret for the error.\u201dThe Padres said they had cut ties with the contractor \u201cresponsible for the error,\u201d and disciplined an employee for not stopping the recording.Billy Bean, an MLB vice-president for social responsibility and inclusion, tweeted Sunday that \u201cit was very unfortunate that there was a technical error\u201d that prevented the chorus from performing but added that the Padres \u201chave supported our inclusion message at MLB without hesitation.\u201d Bean, a former Padres player, revealed he was gay in 1999, four years after his final major league season.With files from The Associated Press.', u'Baltimore cop acquitted of all charges in Freddie Gray caseBALTIMORE \u2013 A Baltimore officer was acquitted Monday of assault and other charges in the arrest of Freddie Gray, dealing prosecutors a significant blow in their attempt to hold police accountable for the young black man\u2019s death from injuries he suffered in the back of a police van.A judge also found Officer Edward Nero not guilty of reckless endangerment and misconduct in office. As the verdict was read, Nero dropped his head down and his attorney placed a hand on his back. The courtroom was quiet. Nero stood up and hugged his attorney, and was visibly emotional.The assault charge carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and reckless endangerment carried a punishment of up to five years.Grey died April 19, 2015, a week after his neck was broken in the back of a police transport van while he was handcuffed and shackled but left unrestrained by a seat belt.Nero was one of six officers charged in the case. He waived his right to a jury trial, opting instead to argue his case before Circuit Judge Barry Williams. A jury trial was held for Officer William Porter late last year, and the panel could not reach a decision on manslaughter and other charges.Grey\u2019s death set off more than a week of protests followed by looting, rioting and arson that prompted a citywide curfew. His name became a rallying cry in the growing national conversation about the treatment of black men by police officers.Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said in a statement that Nero will still face an administrative review by the police department.About a dozen protesters gathered outside the courthouse as the verdict was read.Prosecutors said Nero unlawfully detained Gray and acted callously when he made a decision not to buckle Gray into a seat belt when he was loaded into the back of a transport vehicle.Nero\u2019s attorney argued his client didn\u2019t arrest Gray and that it was the police van driver\u2019s responsibility to buckle in detainees. The defence also said the officers who responded that day acted responsibly, and called witnesses to bolster their argument that any reasonable officer in Nero\u2019s position would have made the same decisions.The defence said the department\u2019s order requiring that all inmates be strapped in is more suggestion than rule because officers are expected to act with discretion based on the circumstances of each situation.The other officers are set to each have separate trials over the summer and into the fall. Nero is white and Porter is black. Two of the other officers charged in the case are white and two are black.', u'More than 80 dead, 200 wounded in coordinated suicide bombings in SyriaBEIRUT \u2013 A series of coordinated explosions including suicide bombings rocked two normally quiet coastal government strongholds in  Monday, killing more than 80 people and wounding 200 others, state media and opposition activists said. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks.The morning blasts in pro-government cities of Tartus and Jableh were the first of their kind targeting civilians in those areas in the course of Syria\u2019s civil war, now in its sixth year. The targets included bus stations, a gas station and a hospital, marking a sharp an escalation in the conflict as world powers struggle to restart peace talks in Geneva.Several rounds of talks were held in the Swiss city earlier this year, although there was no breakthrough and the talks never really took off.Russia, which is heavily invested in the Syrian war on behalf of President Bashar Assad\u2019s government, keeps a naval base in Tartus and an air base in Latakia province, about five kilometres (three miles) north of Jableh. Insurgents fighting to topple Assad maintain a presence in rural Latakia.Syria\u2019s SANA news agency reported that four explosions struck Jableh. The attacks included a suicide bombing at the emergency entrance of the Jableh national hospital, state media said.Jableh News Network, an opposition activist media group, said that one of those killed at the hospital is a nurse, Huda al-Houshi.Shortly afterward, TV reports and residents said suicide bombers followed by a car-laden with explosives tore through a packed bus station and petrol station in Tartus, minutes apart. More than 33 were killed and many injured in the bombings.The explosions caused panic and took people by surprise.A resident said she heard the first explosion followed by the wail of ambulance sirens rushing to the scene. Ninth graders were taking their exams Monday and had just finished at 9.30 am local time, around the same time of the explosion, and the bus stop would have been crowded, she said. The attackers also targeted a nearby gas station, where more than 100 cars are usually lined up to get petrol at this hour of the day, she said.She spoke on condition of anonymity, citing security concerns.Footage aired by the state-run Ikhbariya TV showed several cars on fire and thick black smoke billowing in the air. It also showed the charred remains of cars and minivans in what appears to be a bus station in Jableh.In all, seven explosions ripped through both locations simultaneously: four in Jableh, including three suicide bombings and one car bomb, and three in Tartus, including two suicide bombings and one car bomb.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition monitoring group based in Britain, put the death toll at more than 100.The coordinated and near-simultaneous attacks marked a major security breach of government strongholds that have remained calm throughout the war. Tartus and Jableh are home to thousands of internally displaced people from violence-stricken areas across Syria.The bombings unleashed an immediate backlash against the refugees, with families of the victims attacking IDP shelters. One shelter, al-Karnak, was burned down.\u201cWe will not be deterred \u2026 we will use everything we have to fight the terrorists,\u201d said Syrian Cabinet Minister Omran al-Zoubi on Syrian TV.A news agency linked with the Islamic State group said the group\u2019s militants were behind the multiple attacks.The one-sentence report by the IS-linked Aamaq news agency, which routinely carries the group\u2019s news and claims, offered no details.\xa0___', u'U.S.-Vietnam weapons trade embargo lifted after decadesHANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday lifted a half-century-old ban on selling arms to Vietnam, looking to bolster a government seen as a crucial, though flawed partner in a region that he has tried to place at the center of his foreign policy legacy.Obama announced the full removal of the embargo at a news conference where he vowed to leave behind the troubled history between the former war enemies and embrace a new era with a young, increasingly prosperous nation. Obama steered clear of harsh condemnation of what critics see as Vietnam\u2019s abysmal treatment of dissidents, describing instead modest progress on rights in the one-party state. Activists said his decision to lift the embargo destroyed the best U.S. leverage for pushing Vietnam on abuse.\u201cAt this stage, both sides have established a level of trust and cooperation, including between our militaries, that is reflective of common interests and mutual respect,\u201d Obama said.Obama also had more current motivations. His move was the latest step in a yearslong and uneven effort to counter China\u2019s influence in Asia. Obama\u2019s push to deepen defense ties with a neighbor was certain to be eyed with suspicion in Beijing, which has bristled at U.S. engagement in the region and warned officials not to take sides in the heated territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\t\t\t\n\t\tObama claimed the move had nothing to do with China, but made clear the U.S. was aligned with the smaller nations like Vietnam.The United States and Vietnam had mutual concerns about maritime issues and the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, he said. While Washington doesn\u2019t take sides, he said, it does support a diplomatic resolution based on \u201cinternational norms\u201d and \u201cnot based on who\u2019s the bigger party and can throw around their weight a little bit more,\u201d a reference to China.China outwardly lauded the lifting of a U.S. arms embargo, saying it hoped \u201cnormal and friendly\u201d relations between the U.S. and Vietnam are conducive to regional stability. A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said bans are a product of the Cold War and shouldn\u2019t have existed.China itself remains under a weapons embargo imposed by the U.S. and European Union following 1989\u2019s bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.For Vietnam, lifting the arms embargo was a psychological boost for leaders. The United States partially lifted the ban in 2014, but Vietnam pushed for full access as it tries to deal with China\u2019s land reclamation and military construction in nearby seas.It was unclear whether striking the ban would quickly result in a boost in arms sales. Obama said that each deal would be reviewed case by case and evaluated based on the equipment\u2019s potential use. But there would no longer be a ban based on \u201cideological division,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s been modest progress on some of the areas that we\u2019ve identified as a concern,\u201d Obama said, adding that the U.S. \u201cwill continue to speak out on behalf of human rights we believe are universal.\u201dVietnamese President Tran Dai Quang embraced the chance to enter a new era in U.S-Vietnamese relations. He praised the expansion in security and trade ties between \u201cformer enemies turned friends\u201d and, standing next to Obama before reporters, called for more U.S. investment.Ahead of the visit, in what was seen as a goodwill gesture, Vietnam granted early release from prison to a prominent dissident Catholic priest.Some U.S. lawmakers and activists had urged the president to press the communist leadership for greater freedoms before lifting the arms sale embargo. Vietnam holds about 100 political prisoners and there have been more detentions this year. In March, seven bloggers and activists were sentenced for \u201cabusing democratic freedoms\u201d and \u201cspreading anti-state propaganda.\u201d Hanoi says that only lawbreakers are punished.\u201cIn one fell swoop, President Obama has jettisoned what remained of U.S. leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam \u2013 and (has) basically gotten nothing for it,\u201d Phil Robertson, with Human Rights Watch, said.Obama\u2019s arrival in Hanoi late Sunday made him the third sitting president to visit the country since the end of the war. The trip comes four decades after the fall of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, and two decades after President Bill Clinton restored relations with the nation.Obama also made the case for stronger commercial and economic ties, including approval of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that is stalled in Congress and facing strong opposition from the 2016 presidential candidates. The deal, which includes Vietnam, would tear down trade barriers and encourage investment between the countries that signed it.\t\t\t\n\t\tCritics worry it would cost jobs by exposing American workers to low-wage competition from countries such as Vietnam.Obama and Quang earlier attended a signing ceremony touting a series of new commercial deals between U.S. and Vietnamese companies valued at more than $16 billion. The deals included U.S. engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney\u2019s plans to sell 135 advanced engines to Vietnamese air carrier Vietjet, and Boeing\u2019s plans to sell 100 aircraft to the airline.Obama\u2019s agenda also included separate meetings with prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and Communist Party General Secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong. At a luncheon for officials, the president offered thanks for all who came before to \u201chelp our nations reconcile.\u201d He singled out U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who served in the Vietnam War, for special mention. He said veterans on both sides had showed \u201chearts can change and peace is possible.\u201d\u2014AP writer Nancy Benac contributed to this story.\xa0']

Our party\u2019s journey is only beginning.\u201dHarper paid specific tribute to the party\u2019s gains in Quebec, having elected a record number of MPs, something of which he said he\u2019s personally very proud.\u201cOur party now has a solid base in the heart of the great Quebecois nation,\u201d he said in a nod to the party\u2019s gains specifically in Quebec City, where they won eight of ten seats in the area.The party says there are more delegates from Quebec registered for this convention than similar events in year\u2019s past and there\u2019s already one leadership contender from that province as well, former Tory cabinet minister Maxime Bernier.Harper said the party must be prepared to unite around whomever is chosen as the next leader.\u201cA party driven by hope, by hard work and by higher purpose that Canada can be and must always be the best country in the world.\u201dHarper did not address what\u2019s in store for him next, saying only that he is enjoying not being centre stage any more.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tThe Tories are gathered in Vancouver for a three-day review of their policies and constitution and will select a new leader in 2017.In addition to Bernier, Kellie Leitch and Michael Chong are the other two people formally registered to run and all are already working the delegates at the convention, alongside others considering throwing their hats in the ring.Former cabinet minister Peter MacKay is in attendance, and TV personality and businessman Kevin O\u2019Leary is expected in the crowd as well.', u'\u2018Halifamous\u2019: Theodore returns to Halifax harbour as welcome ambassadorThe beloved Theodore Tugboat has returned to Halifax harbour to officially welcome visitors to the province just in time for the 2016 tourist season.During the winter months, Theodore was notably absent from his home on the Halifax waterfront. He went south for the winter to Dayspring, Nova Scotia to receive some maintenance and a fresh coat of paint.Theodore Too first arrived on the waterfront in May 2000. He is a life-sized replica of Theodore Tugboat, the lead character from the famed TV series.Jeff Farwell, president and co-owner of Ambassatours and Murphy\u2019s, says the international success of the TV series and Theodore\u2019s signature smile are a big draw for tourists.\u201cThe show that was developed by Andy Cochrane was themed here in Halifax.\xa0It was played in over 88 countries worldwide, so the marketing behind Theodore is quite extensive and people do know it on a global basis,\u201d he said.Now that Theodore has returned to the waterfront, he is about to take on a new role as the official harbour welcome ambassador at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.He will also serve as the mascot for the new Welcome Aboard program, which will provide newcomers with access to various cultural and heritage sites in Halifax.Terri McCulloch, communications and charter manager for Ambassatours and Murphy\u2019s, says Theodore is finally receiving official recognition for a role he has performed in the community for years.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a job that he has been doing all along, but it\u2019s official now. He\u2019s a welcome ambassador and he has a big button on the side of his hull to prove it,\u201d she said.Theodore\u2019s Captain, Matt Conlin, says the ship\u2019s presence on the waterfront attracts thousands of tourists every summer who hope to see the harbour\u2019s beauty.\u201cWe have generally about 10,000 people who come on board every single summer. So I would say pretty easily he is helping out the tourism here in Halifax . . . he\u2019s definitely helping to get everyone on the waterfront to realize just how beautiful this harbour really is,\u201d he said.Darlene Grant Fiander, President of the Tourism Industry Association of Nova Scotia, says tourism is important to the province\u2019s economy because it is a $2 billion industry.\u201cOver forty thousand Nova Scotians are employed in the industry and it generates a $225 million tax revenue for the governments, and that money is used to fund social services like health care and education \u201d she said.\u201cTourism is an export industry so it\u2019s new dollars, for the most part, coming into the communities. So it\u2019s incredibly important for the economy of Nova Scotia.\u201dGrant Fiander says a record number of cruise ships will arrive in Halifax over the summer and recent pre-booking reports indicate an increase in the number of visitors to the province for the 2016 tourism season. She attributes these numbers to the low Canadian dollar and the new .When tourists arrive in Halifax this summer, Theodore will be waiting to welcome them with a smile.Visitors can check Theodore out at his new location beside the CSS Acadia in front of the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.', u'Toronto police raid marijuana dispensaries across the cityToronto police have cracked\xa0down on dozens of marijuana dispensaries across\xa0the city\u2019s downtown core \u2014 raiding storefronts, confiscating files\xa0and seizing large quantities of marijuana.Drug squad officers\xa0and City of Toronto Municipal Licensing and Standards officials executed search warrants at an unconfirmed\xa0number of dispensaries, but a spokeswoman for the city said 78 property owners out of a \u201cknown\u201d 83 dispensaries had been given notices\xa0by the city\xa0Wednesday\xa0stating they were in violation of zoning bylaws.Tammy Robbinson said the notices advised dispensary owners that they could face charges and extensive fines if they continued to operate. An unknown number of charges were laid Thursday.Police said the raids were part of an initiative called Project Claudia, which they said\xa0aims to\xa0target dispensaries selling marijuana outside of federal medicinal marijuana regulations.Staff members were seen in handcuffs in various photos on social media as officers\xa0entered numerous dispensaries in the Kensington Market, Queen Street West and Danforth areas,\xa0including\xa0the Eden Medicinal Society located at\xa0760 Queen St. W. and the\xa0Toronto Holistic Cannabinoids Dispensary at 179 Baldwin St.Michael McLellan, a consultant with Eden Medicinal Society, said the dispensary only ever served licensed medical marijuana patients in contrast with other dispensaries who would serve to \u201canyone.\u201d\u201cEmployees were placed in handcuffs and detained,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything more about that at this time.\u201dToronto Mayor John Tory told Global News\xa0the decision to crack down on the dispensaries was made by licensing authorities and police, but he\xa0had previously called on them to take urgent action on the matter.\u201cWell I just think that what we can\u2019t have is marijuana dispensaries popping up like wildflowers all over the city and neighbourhoods and in retail strips,\u201d he said Thursday.\u201cAs to how the law is enforced, you have to ask the police and the licensing people about that but I think we have to have some order to all this and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been saying.\u201dCity Councillor Jim Karygiannis announced Wednesday that he would be holding an expert panel meeting on dispensary regulations on Thursday, but added he was caught off guard by the raids.\u201cPersonally I\u2019m appalled that this is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cCracking down on people and closing them is not the way we need to go.\u201dJodie Emery, a marijuana legalization advocate and wife of Canada\u2019s self-described \u201cPrince of Pot\u201d Marc Emery, said she was shocked\xa0to see dispensaries raided and employees arrested and charged.\u201cI think these raids are unjustified, cruel and only costing taxpayers and harming peaceful people who are not doing any damage to the community and have the support of the taxpayers,\u201d\xa0she said.\u201cTens of thousands of peaceful, sick citizens are now lost about where to find their medical marijuana access. There are many, many sick people still suffering who are now suffering even more knowing that their source of cannabis medicine has been cut off by the police.\u201dToronto police spokesman Mark Pugash told Global News on April 14 that although dispensaries were \u201cillegal,\u201d police had discretion on whether or not to lay charges.\u201cWe use our discretion to decide when it is appropriate and when it isn\u2019t, and our position on the dispensaries is, if we have a complaint, or if there is a public safety issue, then we\u2019ll investigate it, and we do,\u201d he said, adding that the drug squad instead\xa0prioritized the\xa0drug trafficking of dangerous drugs such as fentanyl.\u201cWe have scarce resources, which we have to allocate, which means we make decisions about where we put our resources, and we put them where they will do the most good.\u201dEmery said the raids signalled\xa0a \u201cshocking change\u201d in the way police have approached the issue of marijuana, in contrast to national public opinion.\u201cCanadians want marijuana to be legal, which means they don\u2019t get arrested for pot. So having 80 stores shut down and raided, hundreds of peaceful citizens given criminal records \u2014 this is appalling. It\u2019s shocking and despicable. Shame on the Toronto police and shame on John Tory,\u201d she said.\u201cThis is just a new form of prohibition and it\u2019s costing taxpayers money enforcing something that citizens are no longer in support of.\u201dDeepak Anand, the executive director of the\xa0Canadian National Medical Marijuana Association, said the raids were \u201cimportant\u201d to the enforcement of federal regulations.\u201cIn the interest of public and patient safety, there are federal provisions around the production, sale including distribution of medical marijuana in Canada that are important for the police to safeguard,\u201d he said.Medical marijuana patient Robert, who spoke to Global News under condition that he would only\xa0give his first name, said he thought the raids were \u201cheavy-handed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s harmless, it\u2019s harmless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of weed and it\u2019s not hurting anyone.\u201dIt is not yet clear how many search warrants were executed but police were seen seizing\xa0large quantities\xa0of marijuana products from locations across the city.Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders will present the results\xa0of the raids and the total number of charges laid with city staff at a press conference Friday morning.', u'Researchers estimate 260,000 extra cancer deaths during global recessionThe global economic crisis of 2008 didn\u2019t just cost people their jobs, it is linked\xa0to an estimated 260,000 additional cancer deaths in countries within the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD), according to new study that includes data from Canada.The study, published in the , looked at the link between unemployment, changes in public health-care spending, and cancer mortality using data from 1990-2010 in over 70 countries worldwide, representing more than two billion people.Researchers found that a one per cent rise in unemployment was associated with 0.37 additional cancer deaths per 100,000 people.The study also compared cancers considered \u201ctreatable\u201d (survival rates over 50 per cent), such as breast and prostate cancer, and those considered \u201cuntreatable\u201d such as lung and pancreatic cancer, which have five year survival rates of less than 10 per cent.They found a strong\xa0relationship between rising unemployment and increased\xa0deaths from treatable cancers. After comparing estimates of expected cancer deaths with actual deaths from cancer during the two-year height of the global recession, they found the downturn was linked with more than 260,000 excess cancer deaths\u201cIn countries without universal health coverage, access to health care can often be provided via an employment package,\u201d said co-author Rifat Atun, a professor of global health systems at Harvard Chan School in Boston, in a statement.\u201cWithout employment, patients may be diagnosed late, and face poor or delayed treatment.\u201dLead author Dr. Mahiben Maruthappu, with the Imperial College London, UK, says the results also suggest \u201chealthcare cuts could cost lives\u201d during times of high employment.\u201cIf health systems experience funding constraints, this must be matched by efficiency improvements to ensure patients are offered the same level of care, regardless of economic environment or employment status,\u201d said Maruthappu.The authors of the study say it can only show an association between mortality, unemployment and public-sector spending, and cannot prove cause and effect.Cancer accounted for 8.2 million deaths in 2012, and the number of cases is expected to increase from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million in 2030, according to the study.', u'Will \u2018exemption opportunity\u2019 for assisted dying really end on June 6?OTTAWA \u2013  \u2013 Justice Minister Jody\xa0Wilson-Raybould, May 18, 2016.Jody Wilson-Raybould signalled last week the Liberal government is\xa0concerned about what will happen if there is no legislation in place\xa0when the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s landmark decision comes into\xa0effect next month.The government has been stressing the need to pass its bill\xa0quickly while it is up against the wall on the deadline set by the\xa0top court.\xa0Its proposed legislation is slated to clear the Commons next week\xa0before it is shipped over to the upper chamber, where it is expected\xa0to be closely scrutinized.A number of senators have already indicated they have concerns\xa0about the constitutionality of the bill and have proposed a number\xa0of amendments.As meeting the June 6 target becomes less and less likely, how\xa0accurate is Wilson-Raybould\u2019s claim that the so-called \u201cexemption\xa0opportunity\u201d ends next month?Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a\xa0dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a\xa0ranking of accuracy on a scale of \u201cno baloney\u201d to \u201cfull of\xa0baloney\u201d (complete methodology below).Wilson-Raybould\u2019s statement\xa0earns a rating of \u201csome baloney.\u201d The statement is partly\xa0accurate, but important details are missing.\xa0Here\u2019s why:In February 2015, the high court recognized the right of\xa0consenting adults enduring intolerable physical or mental suffering\xa0to end their lives with a doctor\u2019s help.\xa0The court then suspended its decision for a year to allow for\xa0Parliament and provincial legislatures to respond with legislation\xa0that would be consistent with the constitutional parameters set out\xa0by the court.In January, the court agreed to add four months to the federal\xa0government\u2019s deadline for producing a new law, but with an exemption\xa0for anyone who wished to ask a judge to end his or her life earlier.\xa0The government proceeded to introduce C-14 \u2013 a controversial bill\xa0that has been critiqued by a number of legal experts and groups\xa0including the Canadian Bar Association.The concepts driving the legislation have also been the subject\xa0of a judicial rebuttal.\xa0In a decision handed down last week, the Alberta Court of Appeal\xa0noted the rationale behind the government\u2019s proposed legislation\xa0does not comply with the high court\u2019s landmark decision.\xa0The ruling noted the Supreme Court did not \u201crequire the\xa0applicant to be terminally ill to qualify.\u201dGrace Pastine, the litigation director of the B.C. Civil\xa0Liberties Association, said it is true the so-called exemption\xa0opportunity ends as of June 6th, but she characterized\xa0Wilson-Raybould\u2019s statement as \u201ccompletely misleading.\u201dCritically-ill Canadians will have access to physician-assisted\xa0dying \u2013 even if there is no law passed by June 6 \u2013 because there\xa0will no longer be a need to seek a court exemption and the top\xa0court\u2019s ruling takes effect, Pastine noted.\xa0Physician-assisted dying will be regulated by the provincial and\xa0territorial health care laws as well as the standards of the medical\xa0profession, she added, noting patients will also be required to meet\xa0the criteria set out by the Supreme Court.NDP justice critic Murray Rankin, a public law expert, also sees\xa0Wilson-Raybould\u2019s remarks as off base.\xa0The minister is correct to suggest a federal law would promote\xa0more reliable access across Canada, but she is wrong to suggest only\xa0a federal law can provide it, Rankin noted.Rankin also pointed to the fact the Alberta Court of Appeal\xa0decision highlights how the concepts in the government\u2019s proposed\xa0legislation are more narrow than the Supreme Court\u2019s original\xa0ruling.Ubaka Ogbogu, an assistant law professor at the University of\xa0Alberta, stressed an absence of legislation will simply mean no one\xa0can be prosecuted as of June 6 for doing exactly what the Supreme\xa0Court ruled can be done.\u201cThere is no legal vacuum (as the government has suggested),\u201d\xa0he said. \u201cThe Supreme Court decision becomes the law and it will\xa0then fall to health care practioners, primarily, to decide, if and\xa0how they are going to implement that criteria.\u201dCarissima Mathen, a law professor at the University of Ottawa,\xa0said the minister\u2019s statement is confusing on its face but she\xa0senses Wilson-Raybould was referring to the procedures developed by\xa0the courts to evaluate whether the conditions outlined in the\xa0Supreme Court\u2019s decision are in fact satisfied.\u201cMy reading of what she was saying is even that level of\xa0scrutiny by the judiciary will cease to happen as of June 6 because\xa0\u2026 the courts are no longer authorized to consider exemptions.\u201dTrudo Lemmens, a law professor at the University of Toronto who\xa0specializes in health law and policy, said the minister\u2019s remarks\xa0are reasonable. Most physicians can and indeed should be reluctant to actively\xa0participate in life-ending actions in the absence of a legislativeframework, he noted.Lemmens also noted the Alberta court dealt with its\xa0interpretation of the original Supreme Court ruling, not with the\xa0constitutionality of the proposed legislation.Those who say that courts will reject the constitutionality of\xa0the bill, simply by looking at what the Alberta Court of Appeal\xa0ruled, are making premature statements, he said.Wilson-Raybould\u2019s claim that patients will no longer be able to\xa0go to a Superior Court judge to seek an exemption as of June 6 is\xa0confusing for a number of reasons. However, the minister is correct\xa0to note the exemption opportunity will cease to exist on this date.\xa0For these reasons, the minister\u2019s statement receives an\xa0assessment of \u201csome baloney.\u201dThe Baloney Meter is a project of The Canadian Press that\xa0examines the level of accuracy in statements made by politicians.\xa0Each claim is researched and assigned a rating based on the\xa0following scale:', u'Here\u2019s how much money Canada\u2019s big banks made in Q2Three of Canada\u2019s largest banks reported second-quarter profits on Thursday that beat estimates despite reporting increases in bad loans to the energy sector that cut into the banks\u2019 bottom lines.Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce all reported significant increases in bad loans to oil and gas clients due to low crude prices.On Wednesday, the said it would cut roughly 1,850 positions from its workforce as consumers shift more of their banking online. BMO said its net income for the second-quarter was $973 million during the quarter or $1.45 per share, down from $999 million or $1.49 per share, during the same period last year.Here\u2019s a look at the three banks\u2019 earnings:Royal Bank (TSX:RY) boosted its second-quarter profit by three per cent to $2.57 billion, even as it set aside more money for bad loans.The quarterly net income was up from $2.50 billion during the same quarter last year.RBC\u2019s earnings amounted to $1.66 per share, down from $1.68 per share a year ago.Revenue for the three months ended April 30 was $9.53 billion, up from $8.83 billion during the same period last year.The bank also boosted its provision for credit losses to $460 million, up $178 million or 63 per cent from a year ago.TD Bank reported a second-quarter profit of $2.05 billion, up from $1.86 billion a year ago as its retail banking operations on both sides of the border had stronger earnings.The earnings amounted to $1.07 per share, up from 97 cents per share during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, TD had a quarterly profit of $2.28 billion or $1.20 per share, compared with $2.17 billion or $1.14 per share during the second quarter of 2015.Revenue for the period ended April 30 was $8.26 billion, up from $7.76 billion a year ago.The bank\u2019s provision for credit losses was $584 million \u2013 up $209 million, or 56 per cent, from a year ago, but down $58 million, or nine per cent, from the previous quarter.CIBC (TSX:CM) saw its second-quarter profit grow to $941 million, up 3.3 per cent from the same period last year despite an increase in provisions for soured loans to the oil and gas sector and writeoffs in its personal lending portfolios.The profit amounted to $2.35 per share of net income, up from $2.25 or $911 million during the second quarter of 2015.Adjusted income for the quarter ended April 30 was $962 million or $2.40 per share, compared with $924 million or $2.28 a year ago.Quarterly revenue was $3.63 billion, up from $3.39 billion during the same period last year.The bank also announced it is boosting its quarterly dividend by three cents to $1.21 per share, payable July 28.The quarter included a number of ususual items including a $56-million after-tax increase in legal provisions, partly offset by a $47-million after-tax gain on the sale of a processing centre.CIBC also increased its provisions for credit losses to $324 million from $197 million a year earlier, mainly because of higher losses in the oil and gas sector as well as the card and personal lending portfolios.Barclays Capital analyst John Aiken says CIBC\u2019s results were helped by a tax rate that was lower than forecast and its overall results were above expectations.\u201cWhile provisions came in higher than expected from a spike in energy provisions and consumer write-offs, CIBC did manage to earn through the headwinds and we do not believe that there will be an overly abundant amount of concern in the quarter as the bank\u2019s energy reserve level stands above two per cent and consumer delinquencies appeared to have eased,\u201d Aiken wrote in a research note.', u'Gord Downie for the Order of Canada: Petition starts for Tragically Hip singerA petition has started up on  to honour  lead singer  with the .Downie, who was diagnosed in December with , has not been given a prognosis, but is set to embark on an  \u2014 the band\u2019s last \u2014 starting at the end of July.The Change.org petition was started by , a radio station out of Barrie, Ont.The petition states:\t\t\t\n\t\tAs of this writing,  to reach the goal of 1,000.

Although the city remains empty of residents, there are firefighters and others there working to restore utilities, repair and clean the city\u2019s hospital and reopen pharmacies and grocery stores.About 2,400 buildings were destroyed but fire crews managed to save almost 90 per cent of the oilsands city.Workers have cleaned up most of the garbage, Cox said.But foul odours will soon be returning.Residents may be allowed back into the community starting June 1, and those who didn\u2019t lose their homes to the flames will still need to clean up and throw out rotting food inside their refrigerators and freezers.\u201cWe would ask returning residents to ensure their appliances, garbage or any other attractants are secured until it can be picked up or delivered to a proper waste management facility,\u201d Cox said.A government guide on the phased re-entry process also advises people not to leave their doors open in case animals wander inside.The Fort McMurray area has always been popular for bears, said Cox.About eight wildlife officers remain in the community. They have set up bear traps in neighbourhoods of concern and will also be proactively placing traps in areas known to be frequented by bears outside the city to \u201cintercept\u201d them, Cox said.\u201cOfficers are going to continue to be focused on this for the forseeable future.\u201d', u'Photos of 15-year-old Alex Radita released during trial for Calgary parents accused of not treating teenShocking new court exhibit photos have been released in the trial of two parents accused of killing their teenage son.Emil and Rodica Radita were arrested in February 2014 and pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the trial by judge alone on Tuesday.Police allege they denied Alex (Alexandru) Radita treatment for diabetes, which ultimately killed him. Court heard Tuesday Alex, 15, weighed 37 pounds when he died.On Thursday, the judge approved the release of several photos showing the Radita household and Alex just three months before he died.A search warrant at the northwest home where the family lived led to the discovery of unused insulin syringes and expired glucose test strips. There were also containers of baby food that police believe were given to the teenage boy.A pediatric endocrinologist continued her testimony\xa0in the case Thursday.On Wednesday, Dr. Daniele Pacaud testified as an expert in diabetes in children. She said she reviewed documents and photos regarding the case and concluded the boy was in a \u201csevere state of malnutrition.\u201dShe told the court Alex \u201cseemed to have not been provided with the proper care for his diabetes.\u201dPolice were  on May 7, 2013.An autopsy revealed Radita died from a bacterial sepsis (Staphyloccus Aureus) from complications of neglect and starvation, due to the Type 1 diabetes.Court documents show Alex had previously been removed from the Raditas\u2019 British Columbia home by child welfare because the parents weren\u2019t properly treating the diabetes. A judge later returned him to his parents\u2019 care.Calgary police allege Alex was not given the necessary treatment once the family moved to Alberta, and the teen\u2019s health declined to the extent that he was confined to his room and subsequently died. The crown contends the boy died a painful and lonely death.The trial is scheduled to last five weeks.It will now take a temporary break from hearing testimony to consider arguments over the admissibility of evidence the crown wants to present concerning the care Alex received while he was living in B.C., before moving to Calgary.', u'Oil surges past $50 for first time in 7 monthsThe price of oil broke through the $50 a barrel barrier Thursday morning for the first time in seven months.U.S. crude traded as high as US$50.21\xa0after the U.S. government reported a larger-than-expected drop in fuel stockpiles for last week.In Europe, Brent crude \u2013 which is used to price international oils \u2014 cracked the $50 mark as well.But prices settled back below that mark a couple of hours later. By noon ET, West Texas crude was trading at US$49.67.Oil prices have been rising steadily in 2016 after hitting a 14-year low of around $26 a barrel in February.The surge in prices today is helping to push up oil-based currencies, like the Canadian dollar. This morning, it was trading at 77.19 cents US, up four-tenths of a cent from Wednesday\u2019s close. By noon, the dollar was trading at just under 77.1 cents US.As well, global stock markets were mostly higher on\xa0Thursday in reaction to oil\u2019s steady rise.\u201cThis move does appear to have been coming for the\xa0last couple of weeks, the question now is whether it can establish\xa0itself in a new range between $50 and $55,\u201d said Craig Erlam,\xa0senior market analyst at OANDA. \u201cWhile supply disruptions are\xa0likely to continue to support prices for now, a further\xa0strengthening in the dollar over the next couple of months could act\xa0as something of a counterweight and keep prices in check.\u201dEarlier this month, oil hit fresh highs for the year due in part to unrest in Nigeria and the . In Nigeria, attacks by militants in Niger Delta region cut the country\u2019s daily output by 800,000 barrels.In Alberta, oilsands production came to a near standstill as the Fort McMurray wildfire forced tens of thousands of people to flee the city and nearby oilsands camps.\u2014\xa0', u'Young Conservatives bucking for bigger role as party bids farewell to HarperOTTAWA \u2013 As Conservative leader  prepped for the federal leaders debates during last fall\u2019s election, someone needed to be chosen to play the role of his chief opponent, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.Conservatives were keenly aware the debates might be the best chance for Harper to show up a man the Conservatives dismissed as a young pup incapable of leading the country.But they also didn\u2019t want their leader, 57, to come off as an old dog \u2014 a tension that still ripples through the party as they head into their first post-election convention and attempt to rebuild public support.To give Harper a chance to practice debating with someone many years his junior, Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre took a turn playing Trudeau\u2019s part.Poilievre was only 25 when first elected in 2004, one of many Conservatives who took a seat in the House of Commons while still in their twenties and who are still in those seats today. There are currently 18 Conservative MPs younger than the current prime minister, who is 44.So it\u2019s frustrating to many young Conservatives that people think about Trudeau first when it comes to who can appeal to young voters, said Justin Burton, who first joined the Conservatives when he was 18.Now 30, Burton has started a think tank called Future Leaders of the CPC to connect young Tories to the current MPs. Up until a year before the fall election, he would rarely get his calls to MPs returned.Then came a deluge as the party realized the youth vote was going to be a key component of the campaign as the Tories prepared to battle the Liberals.The party needs to start reaching young voters far sooner, Burton said, including people who might not be eligible to vote today but will be in 2019. To do so requires a mix of a far more savvy communications strategy, a strong leader and a refresh of party policy, he said.But if that\u2019s what young people want, they need to take responsibility too, said Natalie Pon, 24, who sits on the executive of the Edmonton West riding association.Pon said she got involved in her electoral district association on her own and has received nothing but support from the start, not just from her local MP but also party officials.She is one of the co-sponsors of what could be one of the hottest debates at this weekend\u2019s Conservative party convention \u2014 the issue of deleting references in existing party policy that oppose same sex marriage.She brought it forward because she wanted a contemporary policy that reflected the actual laws of Canada, she said.Two pieces of legislation currently in the works from the Liberal government have their roots in policies brought forward by young Liberals at their convention \u2014 assisted suicide and the decriminalization of marijuana.The Liberals, however, have an official youth wing of the party that has long had an activist role. No such body exists within the Conservatives though there are proposals at the convention to change that.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tThere is already a network of Conservative youth clubs across the country, including one at McGill University.There, members organized an online fundraising campaign to send as many people as they could to this weekend\u2019s convention.The fact that money has been pledged from Conservative MPs \u2014 including at least two people thinking about running for leader \u2014 is a sign the party recognizes youth need to be part of the party\u2019s rebuilding process, said Adam Wilson, 20, the president of the Conservative Association of McGill University.Young voters have been written off in the past because of the perception they don\u2019t engage; but turnout in 2015 was higher than ever, he pointed out.A preliminary survey from Statistics Canada said in 2015 voter turnout for those between the ages of 18 to 24 increased to 67 per cent from 55 per cent in the 2011 vote.\u201c(The party) needs to make it clear they are welcoming to youth,\u201d Wilson said.\u201cEveryone always thinks the Conservatives are the old white male party of the right, but in reality that\u2019s not true.\u201d', u'Doctor-assisted dying expected to be hot topic at Liberal biennial convention in WinnipegWINNIPEG \u2013 Some grassroots Liberals are using the ruling party\u2019s first national convention since taking power last fall to challenge the Trudeau government\u2019s restrictive approach to medically assisted dying.Wendy Robbins, the policy chair for the Liberals\u2019 national women\u2019s commission, is spearheading a push to get an emergency resolution added to the agenda of the convention, which begins today in Winnipeg and runs until Saturday.The resolution calls on the government to amend its controversial proposed law on assisted death before putting it to a final vote, which the government is aiming to do on Monday.It urges the government to drop the bill\u2019s restrictive eligibility criteria and adopt instead the more permissive criteria set out by the Supreme Court when it struck down the ban on assisted dying last year.And it urges the government to allow advance requests for medical assistance in dying.Robbins is hoping to have the resolution adopted today by members of the women\u2019s commission, which was the prime mover behind a resolution to legalize medical assistance in dying that was approved at the last Liberal convention in 2014.However, emergency resolutions must be accepted by the party\u2019s national policy committee to make it to the floor of the convention and there\u2019s no guarantee Robbins\u2019 resolution will get that far.Indeed, Robbins said she\u2019s come under \u201ca certain amount of pressure\u201d from senior Liberals to withdraw the resolution in the interests of demonstrating a united front behind the fledgling government\u2019s first important piece of legislation.\u201cThey really don\u2019t want grassroots Liberals to embarrass them,\u201d she said.But while party brass may be loathe to challenge the government, Robbins predicted the resolution would get plenty of support from convention delegates, if they\u2019re ever given the chance to vote on it.From the government\u2019s perspective, a debate over the assisted dying bill would mar what was otherwise shaping up to be a celebratory post-election convention undisturbed by controversy.The biggest item on the agenda involves not policy but the internal operations of the Liberal party: a proposal to overhaul its constitution to, among other things, do away with the concept of membership, giving anyone willing to register as a Liberal the opportunity to vote in leadership and nomination contests, attend conventions and take part in policy development.Some rank and file Liberals have mounted a campaign to reject the proposed new constitution, which they fear would give too much discretion to party brass to run the party as they see fit.Debate over legalization of assisted dying dominated the last Liberal convention. Since then, the Supreme Court has struck down the ban on assisted death and the government has been scrambling to enact a new law before June 6, when the top court\u2019s ruling goes into effect.It has introduced Bill C-14, which would make assisted death available only for clearly consenting adults \u201cin an advanced stage of irreversible decline\u201d from a serious and incurable disease, illness or disability and for whom natural death is \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201dThat\u2019s considerably more restrictive than the criteria set out by the Supreme Court, which ruled that consenting adults with \u201cgrievous and irremediable\u201d medical conditions who are enduring suffering that is intolerable to them have the right to seek medical help to end their lives.When the government first introduced C-14, Robbins said she was \u201cstunned.\u201dRequiring a person to be close to death before they can get medical help to end their suffering is \u201cabsolutely appalling,\u201d she added.Robbins\u2019 resolution calls on the government to immediately allow people to make advance requests for an assisted death once they\u2019re diagnosed with a grievous condition, like dementia, that will eventually render them incapable of giving informed consent.And it calls for an independent commission to explore the question of allowing advance directives even before a diagnosis is made.Robbins said that would allow a people to make their wish for an assisted death known in the event that they suffer an unexpected, catastrophic event, like a massive stroke.\u201cAs long as people are competent, they should be able to make end-of-life decisions,\u201d she said.', u'Airbnb regulations in Quebec won\u2019t necessarily mean same approach across CanadaMONTREAL \u2013 Quebec may be the first Canadian jurisdiction to regulate home-sharing services but the new provincial law won\u2019t become the only model guiding the evolution of Airbnb, says a senior company executive.\u201cWhat works for one community may not work for another,\u201d Chip Conley, global head of strategy and hospitality, said in an interview.\u201cThe question I think people have is how is it properly regulated in a way that makes sense for local communities and that may be different in Vancouver than it may be in Toronto.\u201dThere are vast differences in approaches, including taxation laws, in the 34,000 cities in which Airbnb currently operates.Conley said the company has no problem with local regulations that require, for example, guests to pay lodging taxes or that force property owners who rent out units as a full-time business to register with authorities.\u201cTo be regulated is to be accepted,\u201d he said.However, he added that Quebec\u2019s law, which came into effect on April 15, needs to make a clearer distinction between property managers who make hundreds of thousands of dollars and home owners who occasionally rent out their primary residences a few times a year to help pay for vacations.The Quebec law requires owners who frequently rent out their properties to obtain the same provincial certification as hotel and bed-and-breakfast operators, and therefore charge travellers lodging taxes of up to 3.5 per cent.Since its implementation last month, requests for certification have more than doubled, said the tourism agency responsible for implementing the law.Violators face fines between $500 and $50,000.Xavier Gret of the Quebec Hotel Association says he\u2019s optimistic the province has found the formula to regulate a problem angering an industry that claims to have lost thousands of room rentals due to the presence of Airbnb in the province.The association says hotels are not opposed to the use of technology but want a level playing field to compete against Airbnb.\u201cWe are not in a war with the Airbnb platform,\u201d he said in an interview.Canada is one of Airbnb\u2019s largest global markets, and Montreal is one of its Top 10 cities. Nearly a million Canadians have used Airbnb and about 650,000 visitors to Canada used Airbnb last year.Airbnb has launched a pilot project in Ontario. It emails the 11,000 people in the province who list their homes on the site, telling them to report the income and educate themselves about consumer protection rights such as cancellations and refunds.It\u2019s also testing in several cities an initiative in which landlords get a cut when allowing tenants to rent their units.Critics of the service say it\u2019s rife with entrepreneurs renting out multiple properties. Airbnb says 85 per cent of its global \u201chosts\u201d rent out their primary residences in large cities on average five to six times a month.Still, Conley acknowledges that Airbnb can have a negative impact on housing availability in cities with affordable housing crises.He said the service removes tens of thousands of listings that involve speculators converting entire buildings into illegal hotels. In cities like San Francisco, for example, hosts are not permitted to rent out secondary residences.', u'Filipino president-elect Duterte apologizes to Trudeau for Canadian\u2019s beheading by militantsSHIMA, Japan \u2013 A spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there\u2019s a good chance the Group of Seven leaders will agree that their countries should not pay ransom to terrorists.Peter Boehm, Trudeau\u2019s personal representative at the G7, told reporters there\u2019s a good chance that position will be included in the communique from the summit this week in Japan.\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing sense that the problem isn\u2019t going away, that citizens of our countries can be in danger at any time and by paying ransom you are just aiding and abetting terrorists,\u201d said Boehm, the deputy minister of international development who served as Canada\u2019s ambassador to Germany from 2008-2012.He added that Trudeau has been pushing for the G7 leaders to join Canada in refusing to pay ransoms to kidnappers.Boehm\u2019s comments followed a media report from the Philippines that says Trudeau has received an apology from Filipino president-elect Rodrigo Duterte for the killing of Canadian hostage John Ridsdel.The online report by Rappler says Duterte told a news conference he apologized to Trudeau on Tuesday when the Canadian prime minister called to congratulate him on his recent election victory.The militants had been asking for a ransom payment in exchange for Ridsdel\u2019s release before he was beheaded last month.Another Canadian, , was kidnapped by the same group and is still being held hostage in the Asian country.The Rappler report also says Duterte said Trudeau brought up the \u201cuniversal declaration of human rights.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m following it \u2014 I said that we are partners, may we remain partners for all time,\u201d Duterte said, according to Rappler.\u201cPlease accept my apologies for the incident that resulted in the killing of your national and we will try our very best to make sure nothing of the sort will happen again.\u201dThe report said Duterte described his nine-minute conversation with Trudeau as a \u201ccivil\u201d one.He also said he commended Trudeau for the protection of Filipino workers in Canada, Rappler reported.\u201cI am aware there are Filipinos, a lot of them, working there,\u201d said Duterte.\u201cI am happy that they have found protection even in the labour laws.\u201dA spokesman for Trudeau confirmed that the prime minister spoke with Duterte, but declined to offer details of the call.Cameron Ahmad says the Canadian government won\u2019t comment or release any information that could compromise ongoing efforts or endanger the safety of the remaining hostages.Ahmad says the government\u2019s first priority is the safety and security of its citizens.The militants released a video showing Ridsdel\u2019s beheading, an American group that monitors jihadi websites said after his killing.Ridsdel, 68, of Calgary, was one of four tourists \u2014 including Hall, Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad and Filipina Marites Flor \u2014 who were kidnapped last Sept. 21 by Abu Sayyaf militants.In a series of tweets, Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group cited the video as saying Ridsdel was beheaded on April 25 \u201cdue to non-compliance\u201d of the Canadian government.Ridsdel was beheaded after Abu Sayyaf militants made a large ransom demand for his release.Trudeau has said Canada would never pay ransom for the release of hostages.\u201cPaying ransom for Canadians would endanger the lives of every single one of the millions of Canadians who live work and travel around the world every single year,\u201d Trudeau said earlier this month.A senior official said at the time that the RCMP was conducting a criminal investigation into Ridsdel\u2019s murder.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the ongoing hostage case, said the Mounties were relying on the extraterritorial provisions of the Criminal Code to pursue the overseas investigation.The two Canadians, Sekkingstad, who is a permanent resident of Canada, and the Filipina woman were snatched from a marina.Ridsdel\u2019s body was found by villagers beside a dry creek in a mountain near Talipao town in Sulu province. Police recovered his head in Sulu\u2019s Jolo town.', u'Cavaliers crush Raptors 116-78 in Game 5CLEVELAND \u2013 The Toronto Raptors rode a wave of momentum into Cleveland on Wednesday.But by the merciful end of an atrocious Game 5 effort, it was tough to believe the Raptors had ever beaten the Cavaliers at all.Cleveland\u2019s trio of Kevin Love, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving combined for 71 points as the Cavaliers thoroughly trounced the Raptors 116-78 to take a 3-2 lead in the NBA Eastern Conference finals.\u201cThey kicked out butts. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said in the post-game news conference, over the cheering of a Cavs fan out in the corridor.DeMar DeRozan had just 14 points, while Kyle Lowry had 13, but no other Raptor scored in double digits in Toronto\u2019s worst performance of these playoffs. Jonas Valanciunas returned from his ankle injury to score nine points in 19 minutes.The Raptors were coming off back-to-back victories at the Air Canada Centre, infusing fans with a glimmer of hope for an historic NBA finals appearance. But the Cavaliers\u2019 homecourt had proven deadly to Toronto in Games 1 and 2: a 50-point deficit combined.The Raptors are now a loss away from ending the deepest playoff run in franchise history.Casey has predicted a different game on their return trip to Cleveland, but it was evident virtually from the opening whistle that they were in for a long night.\u201cWe knew they were going to come out like a freight train and they did, and we didn\u2019t meet that level of physicality on either end of the floor,\u201d Casey said.Instead, they laid down on the tracks. In a noisy Quicken Loans Arena awash in wine and gold, the Raptors looked completely discombobulated. They were terrible in virtually every category, a dog\u2019s breakfast of poor decisions, terrible shooting, and head-slapping turnovers. Their defensive effort, against a Cavs team that opened the post-season 10-0, was half-hearted.\u201cWe just didn\u2019t get in a rhythm,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cIt was kind of stagnant. We had (19) turnovers, that\u2019s (19) opportunities that we could have had to at least run something. . . but we turned it away.\u201dThey\u2019d dug themselves an 18-point deficit by late in the first quarter, and when Love drained a three-pointer late in the second, the Cavs were up by a whopping 34 points. Cleveland\u2019s 65-34 lead at the break was the biggest halftime gap in conference finals history.When it seemingly couldn\u2019t get worse, it did. Frustration mounted. The Raptors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else. And by the end of the third, the score was a shocking 100-60.Both teams subbed out their starters for a fourth quarter played after hundreds of fans had already departed the building. According to ESPN Stats, it was the fifth largest margin of victory in conference finals history.Lowry and DeRozan shot just 7-for-20 between them against a smothering Cavaliers defence, and DeRozan was left lamenting his lack of activity.\u201cI only took eight shots, and a couple of shots came late in the game when we were down,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come out aggressive like I wanted to. . . just got to understand no matter how they play, just got out there an be aggressive.\u201cJust eight shots throughout the whole game \u2013 that\u2019s not me.\u201dCavs coach Tyronn Lue had blamed their two losses in Toronto on poor shooting, and his team proved him right. The Cavs shot 57 per cent on the night. Love, who\u2019d made just five of 23 shots in Games 3 and 4, topped Cleveland with 25 points on 8-for-10 shooting.The Cavs grabbed 48 rebounds to Toronto\u2019s 27 \u2013 just one more than Bismack Biyombo had, on his own, in Game 3. Biyombo had just four rebounds after grabbing 40 the past two games.The Raptors coughed up 30 points on 19 turnovers.The series returns to the Air Canada Centre for Game 6 on Friday. A victory, however, would send them back into Cleveland for a do-or-die Game 7, where the noise reached ear-splitting levels Wednesday night in a crowd that included Montreal Canadiens star P.K. Subban and Browns defensive back Joe Haden.While the Raptors won the regular-season series against Cleveland, all their victories came at home. They\u2019ve now lost all four trips across the border this season.Asked why the Cavs are so lethal at home, Lowry shrugged.\u201cI dunno,\u201d he said. \u201cThey play extremely well here. Tonight, Kevin Love got it going early, Kyrie got it going early. LeBron did what he usually does. We\u2019ve got to take one of them out of the game.\u201cThey play very well here, they\u2019ve protected home all year.\u201dShots of Canadians Drake, Justin Bieber and Nickelback flashed on the Jumbotron, encouraging fans to boo. Late in the game, the camera focused on a downcast Raptors fan folding his \u201cWe The North\u201d flag.DeRozan\u2019s four points were the most by a Raptor in a first quarter that saw Toronto trail by just four points before the Cavs closed the quarter on a 17-3 run to end the frame up 37-19.Lowry\u2019s six points topped Toronto in the second quarter, but they were barely noticeable in a quarter the Cavaliers outscored their visitors 28-15.', u"No room for sexual misconduct on navy ships: commanderVICTORIA \u2013 The West Coast\u2019s top-ranking naval officer says there\u2019s no room for sexual misconduct on board his ships, and he\u2019s on a mission to offer support and comfort to victims of abuse.Rear Admiral Gilles Couturier said Wednesday in an interview with The Canadian Press he won\u2019t tolerate sexual misconduct offences in the Canadian Forces.\u201cThe Chief of Defence Staff (Gen. Jonathan Vance) has said, \u2018not in my Canadian Armed Forces,'\u201d said Couturier. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018not in my navy.\u2019 Those kind of people, again, are not the kind of image, the kind of folks I\u2019m looking for. If they are predators, they don\u2019t belong in my outfit. I\u2019ll be as simple as that.\u201dThe commanding officer of Maritime Forces Pacific said military investigations of alleged sexual misconduct incidents have increased since the Canadian Armed Forces formed a crisis response centre last year at the Department of National Defence.Couturier said the increase was expected after the military opened itself to hearing allegations.Former Supreme Court of Canada justice Marie Deschamps delivered a report last year documenting what she described as a culture of sexual harassment in the military.The Canadian Forces\u2019 highest-ranking woman, Maj.-Gen. Christine Whitecross, dismissed reports last May that her work on a response to Deschamps\u2019 review was being constrained by a top military directive to ignore certain recommendations.Deschamps made 10 recommendations, including forming an independent complaints process for victims of sexual abuse.Couturier said he was stung by Deschamps\u2019 report.\u201cI was hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I failed in some area. I\u2019m very keen to make people not afraid to come out.\u201dHe said he was particularly wounded by Deschamps\u2019 finding that people in the navy fear reprisals if they come forward with their stories of sexual misconduct.He said stamping out sexual misconduct in the military remains a work in progress.\u201cWe are not there yet, but we are much more open,\u201d Couturier said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking action to deal with what we\u2019ve observed as a miss in our way of doing business.\u201dThe naval officer said Canadian women should feel comfortable and safe embarking on careers in the navy.", u'B.C. First Nations master carver Norman Tait dead at 75VANCOUVER \u2013 Norman Tait, a Nisga\u2019a First Nation artist whose work is displayed around the world, has died at the age of 75.Tait was known for carving totems, but the self-taught artist\u2019s work also includes masks, jewelry and photos.He died of cancer in Vancouver on May 21, one day after his birthday.Valerie Tait, his oldest child, said in an interview Wednesday that her father\u2019s totems are on display in many locations, including his Nisga\u2019a home in northwest British Columbia, Chicago and Japan, and he even carved a pole for the Royal Family in London.She said he was thrilled by the Royal commission.\u201cEspecially when he was invited to go see her,\u201d she said, referring to Queen Elizabeth.The totem pole sits in Bushy Park, a royal park in London, and features at its base a killer whale, considered the monarch of the sea, and on the top, an eagle, the monarch of the air.Norman Tait graduated from the British Columbia Institute of Technology\u2019s millwright program in 1963 and later worked for the paper mill Skeena Cellulose in Prince Rupert, B.C.He moved his family to Vancouver in 1971 and while waiting for millwright work, began to carve.But Valerie Tait said there were no Nisga\u2019a carvers alive to teach him how it was done.\u201cThat\u2019s when he started looking in all the museums. He said he went through every place that he could find within his reach to study the work, the masters.\u201dShe said he soon began making more money carving than he did as a millwright.Tait was the first person to have a solo exhibit at Vancouver\u2019s Museum of Anthropology with 125 pieces, a show which his daughter said he was extremely proud of.His work was featured in three books, and showcased in numerous exhibitions, performances and videos.In 2012, he was presented with a British Columbia lifetime achievement award for his First Nations\u2019 Art.Valerie Tait said her dad\u2019s legacy will be long lasting because of his unique style and through the many he taught to carve, including her son, his grandson, Kristopher.She said her father hadn\u2019t finished a piece for a while before his death.\u201cIt really hurt to him have idle hands,\u201d she said.Norman Tait leaves behind his daughter, his son Micah, brothers and sisters, grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.', u'Liberals to roll back public-sector bargaining changes made by ToriesOTTAWA \u2013 The federal Liberals say they\u2019ll roll back changes to public-sector bargaining brought in by the previous Conservative government.Treasury Board President Scott Brison says in a release that portions of the 2013 omnibus budget bill will be formally repealed with new legislation when Parliament returns from the summer recess next fall.The Conservative changes allowed the government to unilaterally decide which employees offered essential services and therefore determine who was allowed to strike.The 2013 bill also made salary arbitration dependent on the government\u2019s budget priorities, curtailing the independence of the process.Public-sector unions promised a constitutional challenge to what they said was an attack on collective bargaining.The Liberal government has already introduced legislation to repeal two other controversial Conservative-era labour bills that would have forced all unions to publicly disclose their internal financial workings and changed the process for union certification and de-certification.\u201cBy restoring fair and balanced labour laws, the government is recognizing that labour unions play an important role protecting workers\u2019 rights and strengthening the middle class,\u201d Brison said in a news release Wednesday.\u201cAs another important step in rebuilding the relationship with Canada\u2019s public service, we are moving to repeal changes to the public service labour relations regime brought into law by the previous government.\u201d', u'What a high-risk NCR designation could mean for Matthew de GroodA man who admits to, and the Crown says it\u2019s considering a high-risk NCR designation for Matthew de Grood.The Criminal Code of Canada states an\xa0NCR designation can result when\xa0\u201can accused committed the act or made the omission that formed the basis of the offence charged, but was at the time suffering from mental disorder.\u201dJustice\xa0Eric Macklin said due to testimony from psychiatric experts, he believes \u201cde Grood was suffering from a mental disorder that rendered him incapable of appreciating or knowing that his actions were wrong.\u201dDe Grood, 24, will be kept in a secure psychiatric facility pending assessment by the Alberta Review Board.With an NCR designation, the\xa0person is neither acquitted nor convicted of the crime.So what does it mean when a person is deemed high-risk?For one thing, it means there are stricter rules surrounding the person\u2019s conditions, and future potential release from psychiatric care.Secondly, any decision by the review board would need to approved by a judge.\u201cIf the board of review is considering giving an absolute discharge, or a conditional discharge into the community, then that would have to go before a judge to be approved; the board of review couldn\u2019t just do it on their own,\u201d Crown prosecutor Neil Wiberg said Wednesday.With a high-risk NCR designation, de Grood\u2019s hearings could potentially occur every three years instead of annually, Wiberg said.It will be months before the determination is made.\xa0A\xa0high-risk NCR hearing will be held after the first review by the board, which will be in 90 days. De Grood\u2019s treatment team will present a risk assessment along with an update on de Grood\u2019s current condition, which will be taken into consideration for the high-risk designation decision.Wiberg says de Grood\u2019s history and the facts of the case suggest he is a likely candidate for high-risk NCR.\u201cThis is the most serious crime anyone can commit. It\u2019s five counts of first-degree murder,\u201d Wiberg said. \u201cThis was done without drugs or alcohol. So it\u2019s not like someone, if they stay off alcohol, you know, there will be no crimes.\u201dDe Grood also did not display symptoms of mental\xa0illness over a long period of time, Wiberg says, adding it was only in the weeks before the homicides that de Grood exhibited symptoms.De Grood was described as \u201cclearly psychotic\u201d by two\xa0forensic psychiatrists testifying at his trial; .Zackariah Rathwell, 21, Jordan Segura, 22, Josh Hunter, 23, Kaitlin Perras, 23, and Lawrence Hong, 27, were stabbed to death at a house party in the Brentwood area of Calgary on April 15, 2014.\t\t\t\n\t\tOn Wednesday the victims\u2019 families said in a statement the NCR\xa0finding will be \u201ca recurring nightmare.\u201d\u201cIn this system, Matthew de Grood will meet with a mental health review board every single year to determine if he will be granted concessions,\u201d Miles Hong, brother of Lawrence said.De Grood\u2019s defence lawyer Allan Fay said he hopes the\xa0high-risk NCR is not applied.\u201cI\u2019m concerned, but my hope and my belief is that after the Alberta Review Board sees him in 90 days it will be clear that that\u2019s not a necessary step,\u201d Fay said Wednesday.De Grood\xa0could spend the rest of his life in custody, but should he be released, Fay said he hopes he would be able to reintegrate into society.', u'5 things to watch for at upcoming Tory conventionOTTAWA \u2013 Hundreds of federal Conservative party members gather in Vancouver on Thursday for a three-day policy convention.It\u2019s their first meeting since the fall election that saw leader Stephen Harper leave his job after losing government to the Liberals.Here are five things to watch for:The former prime minister is set to address the convention on Thursday night. It\u2019s his first public speech in Canada since he lost the election and stepped down as party leader. He\u2019s kept a low profile in Ottawa since and is expected to do the same at the convention after his brief address. It may be the last time for the party to hear from him as an MP, as he is expected to resign his seat in the Commons in the coming weeks.The convention is a prime opportunity for people seeking to replace interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose at the party\u2019s helm to make connections and for party members to get a measure of the candidates. Kellie Leitch, Maxime Bernier and Michael Chong are the only three candidates officially registered and are sure to have a high profile on and off the convention floor. But others thinking about a bid will also be making the rounds, including TV personality and businessman Kevin O\u2019Leary.While  has appeared to squelch a drive to get her to run for the leadership, it may not be dead yet. A petition seeking to change the party\u2019s constitution to allow interim leaders to run for the permanent job continues to circulate. If there\u2019s enough support, it could be brought forward at a constitutional workshop session on Friday and, if it passed there, handed over to the general membership for a vote.There are dozens of proposed policy changes set to be debated. One that many are closely watching is a bid to drop language from the existing platform that says the party supports legislation defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman.

CIBC (TSX:CM), Royal Bank (TSX:RY) and TD Bank (TSX:TD) will follow on Thursday, and Scotiabank (TSX:BNS) will wrap up the earnings parade next week.The bank said its second-quarter profit slipped three per cent as it set aside more money for bad loans to the oil and gas sector, in addition to feeling the brunt of the restructuring costs.It reported net income of $973 million during the quarter or $1.45 per share, down from $999 million or $1.49 per share, during the same period last year.Restructuring charges have emerged as a common theme among Canada\u2019s biggest banks in recent quarters, as the lenders look to reduce costs and digitize certain functions in response to a tough economic environment and changing consumer behaviours.\u201cThe banks are responding to a very difficult loan growth and revenue growth environment by getting a lot more aggressive with expenses,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.\u201cUltimately, this is really bad for financial services industry employment in the greater Toronto market.\u201dShanahan added that other banks could also report similar restructuring charges \u2013 if not this quarter, then perhaps in the second half of the year.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is over,\u201d he said.Despite the fact that BMO increased its provisions for credit losses to $201 million during the quarter ended April 30, up from $161 million a year ago, Shanahan said he\u2019s still concerned that the bank isn\u2019t setting aside enough money for bad oilpatch loans.\u201cI\u2019d still argue that outstanding reserves aren\u2019t really adequate relative to this large and growing oil and gas exposure that they have,\u201d he said.On an adjusted basis, BMO earned $1.152 billion or $1.73 per share, up from $1.146 billion or $1.71 per share a year ago. That includes a $79 million writedown of an equity investment. Excluding the writedown, the bank said its adjusted net income was up seven per cent.Revenue increased to $5.10 billion from $4.53 billion during the second quarter of last year.BMO also announced its quarterly dividend will go up by two cents to 86 cents per share, effective Aug. 26.\xa0', u'Alberta Oilsands are one of the largest contributors to aerosol air pollution: studyOTTAWA \u2013 A new study in the journal Nature finds that  are one of the largest sources of organic aerosol air pollution in North America.Data from airborne measurements over the bitumen-producing region found that oilsands production contributes at least 45 to 84 tonnes a day of the tiny particulate matter \u2013 comparable to mega-cities such as Paris and Mexico City.The study, whose lead co-author is an Environment Canada scientist, says secondary organic aerosol production should be taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impact of current and planned oilsands development.And it suggests heavy-oil extraction projects around the globe are likely large sources of this type of air pollution.Secondary organic aerosols are produced when volatile organic compounds interact with sunlight and other airborne chemicals to create tiny particles, which have been found to cause lung and heart problems and other health effects.The Nature study found that low-volatility organic vapours from mined oilsands material is directly responsible for the majority of the observed secondary organic aerosols downwind from oilsands projects.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: How to see if your power\xa0and natural gas are back onFort McMurray wildfire evacuees can now check an online tool to see if the electricity and natural gas have been turned back on in their homes.The  shows the electricity status of individual properties (with green or red dots), and natural gas status of neighbourhoods.Blue shaded areas have natural gas service; red shaded areas do not. Likewise, green dots represent homes that have had their power restored, while red dots are for homes still in the dark.Fire damaged some of ATCO\u2019s infrastructure, meaning it will\xa0be some time before regular electricity and natural gas service will resume\xa0for some customers.ATCO also  (see image below). The utility company said it was the best information it had available at the moment.Tens of thousands of people were forced to suddenly evacuate the northeastern Alberta community at the beginning of this month when a nearby wildfire took off. Some people fled their homes with very little notice, others weren\u2019t even able to get home before being forced out by mandatory evacuations.As of 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, the wildfire was estimated to cover 566,188 hectares, including 4,600 hectares in Saskatchewan.. Thousands of homes have sat untouched for three weeks, much of that time without utilities.If a residence is shown on the map to have electricity but owners return home to find that\u2019s not the case, they\u2019re asked to check their main electric panel and breaker for any blown fuses or tripped breakers. ATCO said simply moving any tripped switches to the \u2018on\u2019 position can restore electricity. If this doesn\u2019t restore electricity, residents were asked to call the Electricity 24/7 emergency outage line at 1-800-668-5506.Because workers are still restoring electricity infrastructure damaged during the fire, returning residents are asked to go through their house and unplug any unnecessary appliances to reduce the load.ATCO said it is unable to identify, house by house, how long the electricity was out, therefore it asked people to assume all perishables are no longer fit for consumption.Customers who contacted their utility company to end electricity or natural gas service are asked to please call them to reactivate the account.Below is a tip sheet for restoring electricity and natural gas services to your home.\xa0', u'Canadian researcher hopes to prove exercise can be an anti-cancer \u2018drug\u2019A Canadian researcher is leading\xa0an international clinical trial that he hopes can change\xa0the way we treat cancer.The current focus is\xa0on advanced  patients who\u2019ve stopped responding to traditional treatments. The hope is to extend their life through a\xa0structured, high-intensity workout regimen.\u201cWe want to actually prove [exercise]\xa0does more than just makes you feel better and actually prolongs your survival,\u201d\xa0explained\xa0Dr. Fred Saad, a urologist-oncologist at the .Prostate cancer patients whose options have seemingly run out are encouraged to ask their doctors to join the randomized trial. It\u2019s already been launched in Australia and Ireland and is expected to run in at least 10 Canadian cities, including\xa0Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.Those\xa0who volunteer will be led through\xa0an hour of aerobic and resistance training three times a week, and compared against a control group who will only get general exercise\xa0recommendations.It\u2019s reportedly the\xa0largest\xa0research project to ever be\xa0funded by the \xa0and will cost an estimated $10 million.It\xa0builds on other Canadian research\xa0that\u2019s examined the benefits of a regular dose\xa0of exercise.A 2013 , for instance,\xa0found patients who did 60 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week\xa0had a lower risk of recurrence of the disease and a longer survival.This clinical trial will be the largest ever of its kind, Saad said, and the first to hopefully prove the link between exercise and cancer survival.Life-prolonging cancer drugs \u2014 which he said can cost $50,000 a year for one person\xa0\u2014\xa0can take a toll on patients, often making them lose their hair as well as\xa0causing pain and complications.Those chemotherapy side effects are thought to be lessened by\xa0exercise, as it\u2019s\xa0believed to strengthen bones and muscles.The roughly 100 international researchers working on this study\xa0figure if patients can tolerate more therapy through\xa0exercise, they\u2019ll ultimately live longer.Results won\u2019t be known for five years, so it\u2019s still too early to tell if the findings could be extended to other types of cancer.But \u201cresearchers are betting that exercise could well become the .\u201d', u'As climate warms, grizzly bears and polar bears interbreedIn May about five\xa0years ago, a male grizzly bear woke from hibernation and headed east, toward the Nunavut shore of Hudson\u2019s Bay. He was looking for food, new territory, and a female bear to mate with.His environment was warming slowly \u2013 bad news for polar bears as pack ice shrinks, but good news for grizzlies, whose population is expanding along with their territory.\u201cWe have very healthy populations with improving conditions. We\u2019re probably getting more young dispersing males. They just pick a direction and go,\u201d explains\xa0Andrew Derocher, a biology professor at the University of Alberta.The bear reached the salt water shore. It\u2019s more traditional territory for polar bears, but grizzlies are moving east from the Northwest Territories and western Nunavut.\u201cWe\u2019ve got these young males going out, but when they get to these new areas there are no female grizzly bears,\u201d Derocher says. \u201cIf there were, they\u2019d be mating with female grizzly bears. But they aren\u2019t finding females to mate with, which means they tend to roam farther and farther.Grizzlies and polar bears can successfully\xa0reproduce with each other, but usually polar bears are out on the ice during their mating season, and grizzlies are just coming out of hibernation, so it has tended not to happen in nature.In recent years, however, global warming is ending grizzlies\u2019 hibernation a bit earlier than normal.As a harsh Arctic winter set in, the polar bear gave birth to a female cub that was a different colour from herself.Hybrid bears, call them\xa0grolar bears or pizzlies, are \u201cpretty blond across the back, sort of a dirty polar bear colour. Some of them take on almost a honey colour.\u201dScientists have  calling the bears , from the Inuktitut words for polar bear and grizzly bear.All of the examples known to science had a grizzly father and a polar bear mother,\xa0Derocher says. The hybrid bears are themselves able to breed.Nine have been reported since 2006.The bear was killed near , Nunavut, on the shore of Hudson\u2019s Bay about 250 kilometres north of Churchill, Man.Local hunter Didji Ishalook reported the kill on  on May 15. Global News tried to contact him, but without success.Aboriginal communities in Nunavut are  annual hunting quotas of polar bears, which they can divide up between subsistence hunting and non-aboriginal trophy hunters, who bring in revenue.Self-defence kills are allowed, but count against a community\u2019s quota.\xa0It\u2019s not clear whether the hybrids behave more like grizzlies or polar bears.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know how they\u2019re living,\u201d Derocher says.\u201d\xa0You would think that if mom\u2019s a polar bear, and she\u2019s taught you how to hunt seals for two and a half years, you\u2019d follow that pattern. The hybrids are not really adapted to either world. They\u2019re not white, so they\u2019re not camouflaged for hunting (on ice), and they\u2019re not brown, so they\u2019re not camouflaged for hunting on land.\u201dThe hybrid bears may be a sign of bigger changes to come.Two-thirds of Canada\u2019s polar bears are expected to disappear by mid-century, with a remnant surviving in the high Arctic. In more southern areas, like mainland Nunavut, grizzlies may replace polar bears completely, with polar bears living on only as a genetic quirk of the local grizzlies.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that grizzly bears could take over the genetic material of polar bears. You wouldn\u2019t see any difference in the grizzly bears, but a few of their genes would carry on.\u201d\xa0', u'Trudeau took a day off in the name of \u2018work-life balance\u2019 \u2013 should we all follow suit? has unwittingly stirred up a national debate about work-life balance, one that experts say has the potential to influence some healthy lifestyle changes in some Canadians.Conservative critics and skeptical Canadians have expressed concerns about the leader\u2019s decision to take a personal day in the midst of his trip to Japan,  in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.Trudeau cleared his schedule Wednesday to take his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, to a romantic inn  \u2013 a decision he said is an example of \u201cthe kind of work-life balance that I\u2019ve often talked about as being essential in order to be able to be in service of the country with all one\u2019s very best.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see your hubbub about nannies and extra help and raise you an anniversary abroad. Bold,\u201d Andrew MacDougall, a former communications director for Stephen Harper, quipped on Twitter.And while there are some questions surrounding the logistics of taking a spa day in the midst of a political trip (the prime minister\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t say how many staff he has in tow \u2014 although Trudeau noted he personally paid for the getaway), some argued the move was a selfish waste of taxpayer dollars.But some believe that Trudeau is setting a good example \u2014 one that more people should consider following.\u201cPeople generally need to try to create that kind of balance and take time off if it\u2019s possible \u2014 especially when there are important events or occasions,\u201d said Dr. Scott Schieman, \u201cI think even the prime minister deserves a day or two. It\u2019s a question of what\u2019s reasonable \u2014 one would imagine that he probably works all the time.\u201dAccording to Schieman, multiple studies have shown that achieving a good work-life balance \u2014 or taking time to focus on yourself or your family when needed \u2014 can improve overall work ethic and performance. Not to mention it\u2019s good for your sanity.The 2011 Canadian Work Stress and Health study found roughly one\xa0in three\xa0Canadians feel overwhelmed by work and the demands of their job.But Schieman believes all Canadians can achieve the kind of work-life balance that Trudeau appears to embrace.His best advice for doing so: take a hard look at all of the roles you encompass \u2014 from your career, to your relationship or caretaker roles \u2014 and understand what it is people really expect from you.If that means you think it\u2019s important to spend your anniversary at a romantic inn to foster the health of your marriage, then do so.\u201cThe example [Trudeau] is setting is not about balance \u2014 but about sticking to what is important to you,\u201d said Caird Urquhart, \u201cOne of his core values is family and marriage. That is going to stabilize him in the long run because he is honouring something that is important to him.\u201d', u'Raptors playoff pandemonium stretches beyond the #6ix to HalifaxCanada\u2019s lone NBA team has tied up the Eastern Conference series, and people across the country are joining in the playoff excitement.A newly commissioned mural in downtown Halifax is showing off the east coast hype\xa0for\xa0the .Commissioned by the Raptors and Bank of Montreal, it\u2019s one of many murals painted in cities across Canada in honour of the team.Burt and fellow artist, Joey Cook, painted the mural on Blowers Street in Halifax at the beginning of the playoffs.Following a second win on home court\xa0on Monday, the .The two teams take to the court again Wednesday night in Cleveland, with Toronto hoping for a road win.\u201cI hope to see the Raptors go to the finals,\u201d Burt said.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Nickelback, Corb Lund, Randy Bachman among Fire Aid concert actsA little ol\u2019 band from southern Alberta \u2013 you might have heard of them \u2013 is coming home to help the thousands of people affected by the devastating Fort McMurray wildfire.Nickelback is among the dozen or so performers at the Fire Aid Concert, to be held Wednesday, June 29 at Edmonton\u2019s Commonwealth Stadium. Between 40,000 and 45,000 seats will be available.\u201cThe wildfires have affected the entire country. \xa0The devastation, images and stories of the lives shattered by this resonate with everyone; but, perhaps none more so than Albertans,\u201d Nickelback\u2019s Ryan Peake said. \xa0\u201cAlberta is home for us and we\u2019ve never shied from that.\u201cIt\u2019s the least we could do and we are humbled to be a part of this event with so many talented artists. \xa0So many people have answered the call for help already. \xa0This is the least we can do and we hope that our efforts can assist those that need it most,\u201d Peake said.The concert will also feature Blue Rodeo, Corb Lund, Dean Brody, The Rankin Family, Dallas Smith, Brett Kissel, Randy Bachman with The Sadies, Ian Tyson, Alan Doyle and the Beautiful Gypsies, Dear Rouge, and High Valley.Tickets will cost $35, $60 and $99 and .A program is being set up through Ticketmaster that will allow buyers to purchase extra tickets that will then be distributed to Fort McMurray residents.The football stadium concert venue could\xa0accommodate between 40,000 and 45,000 people, an organizer said. None of the performers are being paid and the organizing group is working with donors and sponsors to handle travel and other expenses.All funds raised will go directly to the Fort McMurray United Way. The United Way will work with the various agencies on the ground in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to help the thousands of\xa0affected residents.\u201cOn behalf of my entire community, we\u2019re truly overwhelmed by the support shown to us over the past three weeks,\u201d Diane Shannon, executive director of the Fort McMurray United Way, said, her voice breaking.\u201cToday particularly I\u2019m so grateful and so moved to be here and to know that the proceeds of Fire Aid will have a profound impact on our ability to allocate the resources necessary to rebuild lives and provide hope to many.\u201dThe concert is being planned by members of Alberta\u2019s Fire Aid Organizing Committee, a group of citizens who got together in a Calgary pub a few weeks ago to begin planning the event.Jeff Parry, a Calgary-based concert promoter and producer, was involved in the 2013 southern Alberta flood benefit concert and said Edmonton\u2019s Commonwealth Stadium seemed like an obvious choice for Fire Aid.\u201cThe money is one thing, but bringing communities together\u2026 it\u2019s like your barn\u2019s burned down and everyone is going to go and help fix the barn. You just go do it and get \u2018er done,\u201d Parry said.\xa0LiveNation and several other agencies came on board, and the concert was quickly organized.Co-chairing Fire Aid for Fort McMurray are three Edmonton-based community leaders: Oilers Entertainment Group (OEG) CEO and Vice Chair Bob Nicholson, Edmonton Eskimos Football Club President and CEO Len Rhodes, and Northlands President and CEO Tim Reid. The mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, Melissa Blake, is also a special Honorary Chair.TD Bank Group also joined the Fire Aid effort with a $500,000 donation.Tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate northeastern Alberta earlier this month when a\xa0nearby wildfire took off, sweeping through the community and destroying over 2,400 structures. \xa0A four-day phased voluntary re-entry will begin next week.', u'Police looking for 2 Good Samaritans who saved Ontario woman from burning wreckagePolice in eastern Ontario are hoping to identify two Good Samaritans who saved a woman\u2019s life by pulling her car away from burning wreckage after a collision that left an 18-year-old man dead.Ontario Provincial Police responded to a collision on Highway 15 near Frayn Road just after midnight on May 7 in the Rideau Lakes Township of Lombardy, Ont.A\xa0Pontiac Sunfire was travelling southbound on Highway 15 when police said it crossed the centre lane and collided head-on with a Volkswagen.Officers arrived at the scene, but the Pontiac was already fully engulfed in flames.Firefighters and paramedics responded to the scene\xa0but the unnamed 18-year-old from Portland, Ont. was pronounced dead at the scene.Prior to police\xa0arriving,\xa0two men driving in an older model blue or black pickup truck arrived at the collision.The men then used a tow strap to move the Volkswagen, which had a 48-year-old Kitchener woman trapped inside, further away from the flaming Pontiac.Police said if it had not been for the unknown\xa0men\u2019s \u201cselfless acts\u201d the woman could have been killed.\u201cHad that vehicle not been pulled away, it would have been a different story.

About 200 disappeared.\u201cWe completely lost contact with them, and we didn\u2019t know if they were alive or not,\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWe assumed that everybody was dead.\u201dHowever, relatives later spotted the girl\u2019s picture among a series of photos on a Syrian news website showing survivors from the capsizing, he said.\u201cThey had hope that she was still alive, and the picture proved that she was still alive,\u201d he said.In the photo, the girl is holding at white card with the number 268 on it.A longtime resident of Halifax, Masalmeh said he\u2019s not sure who took the photo, and he says subsequent requests for information from the Red Cross, the Italian government and police have yielded no useful information.The girl has an aunt living in Kitchener, Ont., and a grandmother living in Jordan, but Masalmeh says the family has had no luck making phone calls and submitting paperwork through official channels.\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even identify that the girl was there,\u201d he said.\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t admit that the girl was still alive, even though we saw her picture there. They didn\u2019t want to release any information \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just bureaucracy or they just don\u2019t know where she is. There must be a way to track her down.\u201dThe girl, originally from the Syrian city of Daraa, may have been unofficially adopted by a Syrian family that survived the capsizing, Masalmeh said.\u201cPeople (there) don\u2019t have paperwork.

Tom Caldwell,\u201d was all it said.Caldwell said he didn\u2019t grow up in an anti-Semitic home, but the decision to punch Rosen came from the idea that the boy\xa0was\xa0\u201cdifferent.\u201d\u201cWhat bothered me was the anti-Semitic thing, I knew that in myself and I knew that was wrong,\u201d he said, adding that at the time he was not aware of the full implication of the punch.\u201cI didn\u2019t articulate it, I couldn\u2019t even tell you what a Jew was. It didn\u2019t mean anything to me.\u201dCaldwell added that what really bothered him about the incident was that Rosen didn\u2019t know why he punched him, but his family probably would have suspected it was an anti-Semitic attack.\u201cSo to think of the hurt it caused that family \u2013that really bothered me, causing that hurt,\u201d he said.\u201cIt would come through my brain from time to time over the years that I felt badly about this and somehow I should make an amend.\u201dRosen, for his part, did remember. Barely.\u201cI remember a punch, let\u2019s put it that way. But why? No recollection of that,\u201d he said, adding that Caldwell\u2019s fist hit him\xa0squarely on the nose.\u201cOther than that it\u2019s pretty blurry in my mind. I don\u2019t remember my assailant. I just don\u2019t remember.\u201dThe 72-year-old retired schoolteacher\xa0said he was shocked by the incident at the time, as there appeared to be \u201cno rhyme or reason\u201d for what Caldwell\xa0had done, but added that the incident did speak to a larger issue within the city at the time.\u201cBasically it was an area where Jewish people had not been. It was the west end of the city and there were very few Jews living in that area at the time,\u201d he said.\u201cSo there might have been an undercurrent of anti-Semitism, prejudice.\u201dRosen said after seeing the apology in print and the ensuing publicity, he decided to reach\xa0out to Caldwell on Monday.\u201cI just said, \u2018It\u2019s Howard Rosen,\u2019 and he apologized to me after making sure that it was me,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cAnd I accepted his apology.\u201dRosen said he had moved on from the incident and that it\u2019s not something he dwelled upon in a negative way all those years \u2014\xa0like\xa0Caldwell had.\u201cEverything that I have experienced in my lifetime, all those experiences that affected who I am and what I wanted to do in the future and my working with other peoples in other cultures, helping people around the world, doing things like that,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m okay with it. I would certainly like to talk to Mr. Caldwell further and find out, you know, what his situation is and how he came to harbour the feelings that he had, and maybe what was going on in his life, and comparing where we were at a very early point in our lives.\u201dThe two plan to meet for coffee (not in a schoolyard) in the near future and discuss the infamous punch, but Caldwell hopes people can take a more powerful message away from the incident.\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to work our way through life and most of us aren\u2019t doing a great job of it, there\u2019s all kinds of could\u2019ves and should\u2019ves,\u201d he said.\u201cWe all have things we feel badly about, or could have done better, and I think it\u2019s kind of freeing when you admit it to yourself and you go to the individual or individuals involved and get rid of the wreckage of the past and try to clean it up.\u201d', u'Canadian soldier dies while training outside base in New BrunswickPolice say they have found nothing suspicious about the death of a Canadian soldier while training in New Brunswick.The Canadian Armed Forces issued a statement saying the soldier collapsed while taking part in physical training outside 5th Canadian Division Support Base Gagetown.He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.RCMP Const. Jullie Rogers-Marsh says the incident occurred at 7:30 a.m. Tuesday in Hazen Park in Oromocto.She says the 33-year-old soldier from Oromocto was taking part in a group run and collapsed.The file in now in the hands of the coroner.The soldier\u2019s name has not been released.However, the military says he was a member of the 5th Canadian Division Support Group Signal Squadron.', u'Stephen Harper is leaving politicsFormer prime minister Stephen Harper will be stepping down from his job as an MP before the fall session of Parliament kicks off.Global News has confirmed that Harper intends to leave politics sometime over the summer.He remained in office following the Conservative loss in last year\u2019s federal election, and has attended a majority of votes in the House since then. Harper was replaced on an interim basis by Rona Ambrose, and the party is expected to select a new leader in spring\xa02017.Harper has not spoken in the House of Commons since he was prime minister, and has not granted any media interviews\xa0since the election. He typically enters and leaves Parliament Hill\u2019s Centre Block through a back door.Harper\u2019s future could include work on a number of boards or he may set up his own institute, according to a\xa0Globe and Mail report. His priorities\xa0will reportedly be in areas like geopolitics and global free trade. That comes as no surprise to Harper\u2019s former\xa0cabinet colleague and former president of the Treasury Board, Tony Clement.\u201cI always thought that Stephen Harper wouldn\u2019t just be about corporate boards \u2026 he\u2019s got an intellectual curiosity and depth that goes beyond those things,\u201d Clement said, adding that Harper is very unlikely to meddle in domestic affairs.Clement added that\xa0Harper\u2019s decision to bow out within a year of the election is \u201centirely appropriate\u201d and that he wishes his former leader well.\u201cI\xa0think he\u2019s at peace with himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe, and I believe he that he believes, that history will treat his prime minister-ship well \u2026\xa0We all knew that he was making plans to move on with his life.\u201dFormer Tory strategist Tim Powers said Harper\u2019s departure is as much about the Conservative brand as it is about his personal career path.\xa0The role of \u201cinternational agent provocateur\u201d will\xa0likely appeal to the former PM, said Powers, and he may find himself modelling his future career on that of former British prime minister Tony Blair, pushing international policy and ideas.As for how history will remember Harper, Powers said it\u2019s far too early to say.', u'Canadian military members more likely to attempt suicide \u2013 and get help: study has found that although members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) are more likely to attempt suicide than the rest of the population, they are also more likely to seek mental health services.The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association journal Tuesday, found that between 2012 and 2013 Canadian military members were 32 per cent more likely to have suicidal thoughts and 64 per cent more likely to plan their suicide than the average person.However, researchers found that members with suicidal thoughts were not only more likely to get help, they accessed more types of professionals for help than civilians suffering the same mental health issues.\u201cThis study supports the criticism that the Canadian public health-care system is not universal but has significant inequities, inefficiencies and varying levels of service,\u201d said Dr. Jitender Sareen, co-author of the study.The study also reported that suicidal thoughts decreased in women, but not men, over time. Researchers suggest this is because women were more likely to seek help from a mental health professional.According to the study, the CAF has made greater investments in mental health services over the past decade when compared to the public sector.Yet, for years, the military has faced backlash over its response to mental health issues among its members. found that one in six members reported experiencing symptoms associated with at least one of \xa0the following mental or alcohol disorders in the previous 12 months:According to  published in November 2015,  than non-army members of the CAF and\xa0at least 50 per cent more likely to kill themselves than the average Canadian of the same gender and age.Neither the 2015 study, nor the recent University of Manitoba study,\xa0looked at Canadian veterans,  of under-treated\xa0PTSD, depression and anxiety.', u'Ford recalls 271K pickups in North America to fix brake fluid leakDETROIT \u2013 Ford is recalling some of its top-selling vehicles to fix a fluid leak that can reduce braking power.The recall covers about 271,000 F-150 pickups in North America from the 2013 and 2014 model years that have 3.5-litre V6 engines.Ford says brake fluid can leak from the master cylinder. That could reduce the ability of the front brakes to stop the trucks.The company reports nine crashes with no injuries, but one person was hurt in an unspecified interaction with the brakes.Dealers will replace the brake master cylinder for free.

The names of the companies were not included in the documents.The data was compiled from 337 compliance assessment reports that were submitted to the federal anti-money laundering agency from roughly 1,000 companies in the real estate sector. It represents only a sliver of the overall industry \u2013 there are about 20,000 real estate companies overseen by Fintrac.\u201cI just wonder how many more audits with dismal results like this have to be returned to Fintrac and the federal government before they decide to really crack down,\u201d Eby said.A spokeswoman for Finance Minister Bill Morneau, to whom Fintrac reports, directed questions to the federal agency.Darren Gibb, a spokesman for Fintrac, said compliance assessment reports are only one tool that the agency uses in its enforcement process.\u201cThey educate our risk-based approach, and that\u2019s essentially all that they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d Gibb said.Fintrac has used the data gathered from the compliance reports to significantly boost the number of on-site examinations it is performing in the real estate sector, he said.It has also invested \u201csignificant time and effort\u201d into working with the real estate industry and the Canadian Real Estate Association to help realtors better understand their obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, Gibb added.But Christine Duhaime, a lawyer specializing in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, said most of the realtors she has met have no compliance plan, no compliance officer and don\u2019t know what a suspicious transaction is or how to report one.\u201cI literally have never met a realtor across the country who really understands or fully complies with AML (anti-money laundering) law,\u201d Duhaime said.A U.S.-based short seller who has been a vocal critic of the Canadian housing market says it\u2019s clear that policy-makers and law enforcement are not doing their job.Marc Cohodes, who once ran a hedge fund called Copper River Management, says he believes it\u2019s illegal activity such as money laundering \u2013 and not local demand \u2013 that\u2019s driving house prices in the red-hot market of Vancouver higher, given that price growth has outpaced wages.\u201cIt\u2019s just not real and it\u2019s not sustainable and it won\u2019t last,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless people do something and do something quickly, it\u2019s going to blow the place up.\u201dThe federal NDP consumer affairs critic says it\u2019s troubling that Ottawa has been ignoring its responsibility to ensure that companies are complying with anti-money laundering laws.\u201cThe government should not be taking a lax approach to these practices,\u201d Brian Masse said in an email.\u201cInstead it needs to ensure that real estate markets aren\u2019t being used for money laundering \u2013 and that money laundering isn\u2019t helping to drive rising real estate costs for Canadians.\u201dThe Real Estate Council of Ontario said it will remind its members of their legal obligations as a result of The Canadian Press report.', u'Provincial medical regulators set detailed guidelines for doctor-assisted dyingOTTAWA \u2013 Medical regulators in every province have issued detailed guidelines doctors must follow to help suffering patients end their lives once Canada\u2019s ban on medically assisted dying is formally lifted next month.And most of those guidelines impose safeguards similar to \u2013 or even more stringent than \u2013 those included in the federal government\u2019s proposed new law on assisted death.The existence of guidelines in every province undercuts federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould\u2019s contention that there\u2019ll be a dangerous legal void if the government\u2019s controversial new law on assisted dying isn\u2019t enacted by June 6.That\u2019s the date on which the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling last year, striking down the ban on medically assisted dying, goes into effect. The court suspended the ruling for 16 months to give the federal government time to enact a new law that allows assisted dying for clearly consenting adults with \u201cgrievous and irremediable\u201d medical conditions who are enduring suffering that is intolerable to them.Wilson-Raybould and Health Minister Jane Philpott have issued seemingly contradictory warnings about the dire consequences that will unfold if the proposed legislation isn\u2019t in force by June 6 \u2013 a feat that seems increasingly unlikely.They maintain assisted death will be readily available without any safeguards to protect the vulnerable. At the same time, they contend many doctors will refuse to provide assistance in dying because of uncertainty about who is eligible.Their arguments are \u201cfalse,\u201d says Josh Paterson, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, a plaintiff in the case that led to the Supreme Court striking down the ban on assisted dying.\u201cNobody is going to be left wondering what they\u2019re going to do on June 6. Everything in terms of the medical profession is ready to go \u2026 We\u2019re not jumping into a void here, we\u2019re not on the edge of a cliff.\u201dLike the proposed federal law, most of the various guidelines produced by provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons require that at least two doctors must agree that a patient meets the eligibility criteria for an assisted death, that a patient must submit a written request signed by witnesses, that there be a waiting period between the request and the provision of an assisted death, that a patient must be competent to give free, informed consent throughout the process, up to the time of dying.Some impose more stringent safeguards, for instance putting the age of consent at 19 rather than the federally proposed 18, and requiring a psychiatric assessment in cases where depression or mental illness might impair a patient\u2019s ability to give consent.The one big difference, said Paterson, is that the provincial guidelines rely on the relatively permissive eligibility criteria spelled out by the Supreme Court whereas the federal government is proposing more restrictive conditions.The legislation would allow assisted death only for consenting adults who are in \u201can advanced stage of irreversible decline\u201d from a serious and incurable disease, illness or disability and for whom a natural death is \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201dThe Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada has expressed concern that \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d death is \u201clegal language that is far too vague\u201d to enable doctors to confidently determine who is eligible for a medically assisted death.\u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u2026 For all of us, death is reasonably foreseeable,\u201d Dr. Trevor Theman, registrar of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons and past president of FMRAC, said in an interview.While they struggle to interpret aspects of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling as well, Theman said the court\u2019s eligibility criteria is more manageable for regulators.Yet the federal government has all but ignored the wishes of medical regulators and the guidelines they\u2019ve produced, citing instead approval of its proposed law by the Canadian Medical Association, which lobbies on behalf of doctors but does not regulate, license or discipline them.\u201cSo it may be that they see a void (if the legislation isn\u2019t enacted by June 6) because they\u2019re not used to dealing with us and they\u2019re less aware of what we\u2019re capable of.\u201dThe three territories do not have independent medical regulatory authorities. However, the Yukon government has issued guidelines for doctors similar to those produced in the provinces and the Northwest Territories government has promised to do the same by June 6.Only Nunavut is waiting to see the final shape of the federal law. Even there, Paterson noted the eligibility criteria laid down by the Supreme Court will still apply, as in the rest of the country.Notwithstanding Wilson-Raybould\u2019s dire warnings, it seems well nigh impossible for the proposed legislation to be enacted by June 6. Even should the House of Commons pass the bill Monday, the first day back after a break week, that would leave less than a week for the bill to go through all stages of the legislative process in the Senate \u2013 a rush few senators appear inclined to accommodate.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Bank of Canada says Alberta wildfires will slow economic growthThe economy will be weaker than expected in the second quarter due to the Alberta wildfires, the Bank of Canada said Wednesday as it kept its key interest rate steady at 0.5 per cent.The rate is a key factor used by Canada\u2019s big banks in determining their prime lending rate, which is used for variable rate mortgages and lines of credit.The central bank said growth in the first quarter appears to be in line with its April forecast, although business investment and intentions remained disappointing.But the bank said the second quarter that ends June 30 will be much weaker than predicted because of the wildfires that devastated swaths of Fort McMurray, Alta., forced the evacuation of the city and resulted in the shutdown of several oilsands operations.\u201cThe bank\u2019s preliminary assessment is that the fire-related destruction and the associated halt to oil production will cut 1.25 percentage points off real GDP growth in the second quarter,\u201d the bank said in its statement.The bank had predicted growth of 1.0 per cent for the second quarter in its April monetary policy report.It is expected to update its full outlook for the economy and inflation in its next monetary policy report on July 13, when it also makes its next rate announcement.The Bank of Canada\u2019s announcement comes in the wake of economic data that suggests the economy ended the first quarter on a soft note after starting 2016 on a hot streak.\u201cIn Canada, the economy\u2019s structural adjustment to the oil price shock continues, but is proving to be uneven,\u201d the bank said.Retail sales figures for March, reported last week by Statistics Canada, were lower than expected and followed reports of lower manufacturing and wholesale sales results for the same month.Statistics Canada also reported Friday that the annual pace of inflation climbed to 1.7 per cent in April compared with 1.3 per cent in March. Core inflation, which excludes some of the most volatile items, for the month was 2.2 per cent, up from 2.1 per cent in March.The Bank of Canada said inflation is roughly in line with its expectations, with total inflation slightly below its two per cent target and core inflation close to two per cent.The central bank also noted that the housing market continues to show strong regional differences, reinforced by adjustments ongoing in the economy.\u201cIn this context, household vulnerabilities have moved higher,\u201d the bank said.\xa0\xa0', u'As Trudeau takes day off in Japan, a look at past PMs\u2019 official agendasOTTAWA \u2013 When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he and his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau would take Wednesday off to celebrate their wedding anniversary during a visit to Japan, critics immediately jumped on the micro-vacation as another example of Liberal entitlement.\u201cI\u2019ll see your hubbub about nannies and extra help and raise you an anniversary abroad. Bold,\u201d Andrew MacDougall, a former communications director for Stephen Harper, quipped on Twitter.Trudeau, whose office won\u2019t say how many staff he has in tow, defended the prime ministerial down time during the four-day Japan trip, calling it an example of \u201cthe kind of work-life balance that I\u2019ve often talked about as being essential in order to be able to be in service of the country with all one\u2019s very best and that\u2019s certainly something I\u2019m going to continue to make sure we do.\u201dThe couple were to spend the night at a traditional Japanese inn before Trudeau heads to the G7 summit on Thursday in the country\u2019s Ise-Shima region. Trudeau said he\u2019d personally pay for their anniversary night out.Whatever your take on the Trudeaus\u2019 11th anniversary hiatus, it calls to mind a different age when prime ministerial down days were a regular occurrence.\t\t\t\n\t\tFormer prime minister Pierre Trudeau often took one or more of his boys with him when he travelled abroad in the 1970s and early \u201980s \u2014 leaving a legacy of news photos of the current office holder as a child with figures such as Cuban president Fidel Castro, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher or Pope John Paul II.Patrick Gossage, a former press secretary to Pierre Trudeau, recalls the prime minister disappearing for a three-day vacation after the 1978 Bonn summit.\u201cThis was a memorable moment,\u201d Gossage said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThe press went crazy. \u2026 He did that from time to time.\u201dTrudeau once took the entire media contingent to Mogadishu, Somalia, to see a durbar horse race and on another occasion went \u201creally strictly sight-seeing\u201d to Saudi Arabia, said Gossage. \u201cBelieve me, that was tourism.\u201dBrian Mulroney, who followed the elder Trudeau in office, largely escaped the travel controversies of his predecessor, sticking to business while abroad even if the pre-Internet media pace was less punishing.Hugh Segal, Mulroney\u2019s former chief of staff, says there\u2019s been a change in workplace \u201cethos\u201d that reflects both the mix of work and play favoured by the millennial generation and changes in information technology.\u201cFrankly, because people are digitally connected, most Canadians know that when they\u2019re on holiday, they\u2019re actually still connected to their work,\u201d Segal said in an interview.\u201cThe barriers between work and holiday aren\u2019t as precise as they used to be. That is a very big difference. Don\u2019t forget: when I was chief of staff to the prime minister, we didn\u2019t have email.\u201dIn January 1998, a devastating ice storm that hit Quebec and Ontario prompted the prime minister of the day, Jean Chretien and the two provincial premiers to skip the start of a scheduled, week-long \u201cteam Canada\u201d trade mission to South America. A bored news photographer managed to shoot a photo of the top Liberal cabinet minister on the trip reading a newspaper by the hotel pool in Santiago, Chile \u2014 all while much of eastern Canada froze in the dark.The publication of that single photo had a demonstrable chill on media management during subsequent international trips.Chretien always endeavoured to feed the press, even on total down days \u2014 such as one Sunday scrum in Buenos Aries when he grudgingly agreed to meet reporters after attending mass with his wife.The assembled media, with nothing on the agenda, were left scrambling for questions. One had the temerity to ask the prime minister what he\u2019d done at church that morning.\u201cI prayed for you,\u201d Chretien shot back, jutting out his chin.When Paul Martin and his wife toured the Great Wall of China during an exhausting global circumnavigation in January 2005, the prime minister took the entire media group along with him \u2014 thus sidestepping charges that he was holidaying on the public dime.And Stephen Harper\u2019s grim, workaholic travel schedules became legendary.The Conservative prime minister frequently froze out the news media travelling with him, but never personally got off the clock.In 2011, Harper flew 26 hours from Perth, Australia back to Ottawa for a cabinet meeting before getting back on his plane and jetting to France for a G20 summit. A Commonwealth summit in Perth and the G20 had been planned as one continuous trip abroad, but flooding in Bangkok cancelled a scheduled bilateral stop in Thailand that was supposed to bridge the day and a half between events.Harper flew his entire entourage literally halfway around the world rather than spend a single down day on the road.\xa0', u'Provinces slow to cover new drugs after approval, makers complainProvinces can take up to 15 months to cover new drugs in their drug plans after they\u2019re approved by Health Canada, a group of drug makers announced today.The delays hurt \u201cvulnerable populations in Canada, such as seniors or those fighting cancer, who are generally covered by public drug plans,\u201d said Isabelle Robillard of , a group of Canadian pharmaceutical companies.The group presented their  at a news conference Tuesday in Ottawa.Private drug plans are \u201cbetter, more generous and faster than what we see in the (public) drug plans in Canada,\u201d said Brett Skinner, the group\u2019s executive director.The group said that it normally took 449 days from Health Canada approving a new drug as safe and effective to provincial plans starting to cover it, a delay that it said placed Canada 15th on a list of 20 industrialized countries.Provincial health ministries are also stingy about covering new medicines at all, the study showed \u2013 only 37 per cent of new medicines ended up being covered by provincial drug plans. The group said that placed Canada 18th out of 20 countries.Provinces make their own decisions about what drugs to cover, to what extent, and what conditions to apply. Provincial drug benefit programs largely cover the poor, disabled and elderly. Eleven million people are eligible for provincial and territorial drug plans, Skinner said.The study looked at larger-population provinces, which between them make up about 80 per cent of Canada\u2019s population, to compare with other countries\u2019 systems.Health Minister Jane Philpott says that adopting a pharmacare policy may be achievable in the future but right now the Liberals are focusing on bringing down prescription costs for big government purchasers.An official from British Colombia\u2019s health ministry says they are aware of the study and are reviewing it.\u201cWe base our drug-coverage decisions on a rigorous review of clinical evidence to ensure we are consistently covering the most beneficial drugs for our patients,\u201d Stephen May told Global News in an email.', u'Japan\u2019s Prime Minister ups pressure on Trudeau over TPPTOKYO \u2013 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe upped the pressure Tuesday on Justin Trudeau by publicly suggesting his Canadian counterpart\u2019s positions had budged on a pair of prickly international files.Following a bilateral meeting with the visiting Canadian prime minister in Tokyo, Abe read a statement to reporters saying the two leaders shared \u201cserious concern\u201d about the territorial dispute that involved the \u201cbuilding of outposts\u201d in the South China Sea.Abe also said, through an interpreter, that Japan would continue to make efforts to seek early ratification of the controversial  treaty \u2014 \u201ctogether with Canada.\u201dBut Canada\u2019s interpretation of the meeting was somewhat different on those two issues.\t\t\t\n\t\tTrudeau initially made no mention of the contentious South China Sea dispute in remarks Tuesday that followed Abe\u2019s. As for the TPP, the government has made clear it is taking its time to review the 12-country Pacific Rim trade agreement before deciding to ratify.Japan is embroiled in an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea. China has been constructing islands despite the concerns of several Asian countries with territorial claims in the area.Last winter, Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida issued a statement confirming their commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in international maritime law.Without naming China, they also said they opposed the use of intimidation, force or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific.Late Tuesday, Trudeau spokeswoman Kate Purchase said in an email that \u201cthere is no change in our position on the South China Sea.\u201d She reiterated Canada\u2019s position, saying: \u201cAs we have said consistently, we believe in the rule of law and discourage any unilateral actions.\u201dKeio University law professor Masayuki Tadokoro said Abe may have been trying to \u201cextract\u201d extra support from Trudeau on an issue that represents a real security threat for the Japanese.\u201cAbe may have exaggerated the level of support he got out of the bilateral meeting for domestic consumption,\u201d said Tadokoro.Trudeau may have been trying to steer clear of the issue \u201cin the fear of undermining its relations with Chinese,\u201d he added.Tadokoro said while there\u2019s no way to know what Abe and Trudeau actually said to each other, \u201cit is not uncommon in diplomacy that things are deliberately left for convenient interpretations of both sides.\u201dKenjiro Monji, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in recent interview that on security issues Canada has long kept its attention toward Europe and the south because it is an Atlantic state.Monji said Canada is also a Pacific nation, but Canadians\u2019 renewed focus on Asia has primarily been through \u201ceconomic lenses.\u201dHe added that Japan has put a lot of importance on TPP and hopes to ratify it as soon as possible.Trudeau repeated his government\u2019s long-held position Tuesday that the TPP was still subject to a thorough, cross-country review.The TPP was negotiated by the former Conservative government and the Liberals have yet to signal whether they will ratify it.But the future of the TPP is in doubt. U.S. presidential hopefuls from both major parties have said they would reject the deal if elected.On Tuesday, Trudeau focused on boosting Canada\u2019s economic ties to Japan. He personally invited Japanese auto executives to invest more in Canada.\t\t\t\n\t\tBut it appeared his efforts in Tokyo wouldn\u2019t immediately secure concrete commitments from the auto industry.Trudeau met with parts manufacturers and the presidents of three auto companies: Honda, Toyota and Subaru.The CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries, the firm that makes Subaru, told Trudeau he doesn\u2019t have any plans to expand capacity in the near term, though he might in the future, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary Cameron Ahmad said after the meeting.There were no announcements of imminent deals with the others, either.\u201cI am very much in the relationship-building mode,\u201d Trudeau told a news conference in Tokyo when asked whether the meetings would yield firm results.As part of his pitch, the prime minister also told Yoshinaga that Canadians are innovative and focused on quality.He later described the meetings as \u201csuccessful.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, visited the Meiji Shrine, met with the emperor and empress of Japan and had dinner with Abe.Trudeau\u2019s Tokyo visit came ahead of the Group of Seven summit on Thursday and Friday in Japan\u2019s Ise-Shima region.', u'RCMP must use body-worn cameras when expecting to use forceOTTAWA \u2013 Mounties wearing tiny video cameras must hit the record button when there is \u201ca high likelihood\u201d they\u2019ll use force against someone, says an interim RCMP policy on use of the devices.In general, officers have discretion as to when to turn on the cameras that clip on a uniform, or may be embedded in glasses or a helmet.But RCMP members should not record every public encounter or conversation, according to the interim policy. And when \u201ctactically feasible,\u201d officers are supposed to inform citizens when they are being recorded.The national police force recently published a summary of the policy, which was provided to a small number of RCMP officers who were involved in a video camera feasibility study last year.If the body-worn video program is adopted force-wide, the policy will be finalized and a full version released publicly, said Sgt. Harold Pfleiderer, an RCMP spokesman.RCMP detachments in Wood Buffalo, Alta., and Windsor and Indian Head, N.S., took part in the 2015 tests. In addition, the Mounties have advised the federal privacy commissioner of ad-hoc evaluations of the technology.Evaluations of the cameras were also carried out at the RCMP training facility in Regina, involving scenarios ranging from everyday interactions to use of lethal force.The RCMP continues to assess the video technology, but no additional field trials are taking place and no cameras have been approved for operational use, Pfleiderer said.It is too early to speculate on future use of the cameras due to the complex privacy, legal and policy issues that \u201cmust be carefully considered before moving forward,\u201d he added.A number of violent confrontations between police officers and civilians across North America have generated intense controversy in recent years.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe small video cameras are intended to openly capture an \u201caccurate, unbiased and reliable\u201d audio and video account of incidents from the officer\u2019s perspective, the RCMP says in the interim summary.The purpose is twofold: to gather evidence for prosecution should criminal behaviour be recorded and to bolster accountability if questions or concerns arise after an incident.\u201cPolice are making use of a relatively new technology to hold both police officers, and members of the public we interact with, accountable for any actions taken,\u201d the RCMP says.The high-resolution digital images the new body-worn cameras produce allow for a clear view of individuals and are suited to running video analytics software, such as facial recognition, privacy commissioners from across Canada noted in a guidance document developed last year.\u201cMicrophones may be sensitive enough to capture not only the sounds associated with the situation being targeted but also ambient sound that could include the conversations of bystanders,\u201d said the document.The interim RCMP policy says the force has taken steps to address privacy risks by:The RCMP has told the privacy commissioner another assessment of the technology would be undertaken and provided to the watchdog for comment in advance of any national roll-out of body-worn cameras, Cohen said.The Mounties also have to consider how storage of the recordings would meet requirements of federal privacy law, police records management and court disclosure, Pfleiderer said.Other things to sort out are video clarity, battery life and the \u201coperational durability\u201d needed when officers are trying to safely resolve difficult situations involving emotionally charged people, he added.\xa0', u'KFC confirms all-you-can-eat buffet in Weyburn, Sask. not closing \u2013 yetREGINA \u2013 Saskatchewan residents caused a stir on social media Tuesday after news spread that the all-you-can-eat KFC buffet in Weyburn, Sask. was closing.However, late Tuesday afternoon, KFC Canada released a statement saying the buffet will remain open, but it cannot confirm for how long.\u201cThis afternoon, KFC learned that our buffet in Weyburn, Saskatchewan was closing. Like many people, we were surprised by this news. We can confirm the buffet is not closing,\u201d Leonard Free, director, operations and restaurant excellence, KFC Canada, said in the statement.\u201cWhile we cannot guarantee that the Weyburn buffet will remain open forever, we can guarantee that it will be open for now.\u201dAccording to posts on social media on Tuesday, KFC\u2019s parent company Yum! Brands is planning on shutting down the popular buffet.Larie Semen, head manager at the KFC in Weyburn, said as of right now, he hasn\u2019t heard that the buffet is closing.Top brass from KFC Canada are expected to be touring the location on Wednesday. With the customers, Semen plans to show them how much the buffet means to the community.He said he has been blown away by the support from Saskatchewan residents and the government.\u201cThis was supposed to be local,\u201d Semen said. \u201cAll I wanted was Weyburn and the surrounding areas was to come and support the buffet.\u201dWeyburn residents had been planning a \u2018sit-in\u2019 on Wednesday afternoon when company officials attend the restaurant.Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall took to twitter on Tuesday, expressing his dismay at the news and asking Yum! Canada to reconsider their decision to shut down the KFC buffet.Saskatchewan\u2019s Health Minister used to work at the Weyburn KFC when he was a teenager, and is planning on attending the sit-in on Wednesday.Back in 2012 Premier Wall sent out a tweet joking that Duncan may look like Colonel Sanders.Semen said about four to five years ago, the store was told the buffet would close in one year. However, he started a petition to save the buffet.\u201cWe sent it with a portfolio on how much the buffet generates for sales in Weyburn and what it stands for in our community, what it stand for in our business and it\u2019s been unbelievable,\u201d Semen said.However, Semen said one change was that items not offered at other KFC restaurants were taken out of the buffet.According to Semen, the KFC buffet opened in 1988 and was the first one in Canada. In the next couple of years, Semen said the Weyburn location is expected to remodel.\u201cThat\u2019s where I believe, the remodel is going to come \u2013 the buffet will automatically go off the remodel. So it will be straight KFC and no buffet.\u201dIn 1996 and 1997 the KFC in Weyburn was voted the best KFC in Canada.Humboldt also has a KFC lunch buffet from Monday to Friday.', u'Omar Khadr\u2019s bid to have U.S. appeal judge tossed is deniedTORONTO \u2013 An attempt by Canada\u2019s Omar Khadr to have a judge thrown off his appeal panel has raised important legal questions that U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress should deal with quickly, a court in Washington has ruled.Nevertheless, the D.C. Circuit said it was not prepared at this time to grant the former Guantanamo Bay inmate\u2019s request.\u201cAlthough we deny the writ, we cannot deny that Khadr has raised some significant questions,\u201d the D.C. Circuit said.\u201cWe encourage Congress and the executive branch to promptly attend to those issues.\u201dAt issue is Khadr\u2019s call to have the court toss presiding Judge William (Bill) Pollard from the panel hearing his appeal of his war crimes conviction. Khadr and his lawyers argue that Pollard\u2019s position on the panel is illegal based on federal statutes that prohibit a judge from continuing to work as a lawyer.Pollard, a partner in a Wall Street law firm, is one of two civilian appointees on the U.S. Court of Military Commission Review, which acts as an appeal court for matters related to military commissions.The presidential appointee has refused to step down, arguing the rules do not apply to his situation. He maintains he\u2019s a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d of the Department of Defence and is allowed to work as a judge on the military review court while maintaining his law practice.In its decision, the D.C. Circuit said the law does not afford Khadr a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to the \u201cdrastic and extraordinary remedy\u201d of having Pollard bumped. At the same time, the court said, if the Court of Military Commission Review denies Khadr\u2019s war crimes appeal, he can raise the Pollard issue again.\u201cOur denial\u2026does not preclude Khadr from advancing these same arguments in a future appeal where the standard of review will not be so daunting,\u201d the court said.In the interim, the court said the U.S. government and Congress must make clear whether civilians who serve as judges on the Court of Military Commission Review can also practise law part time and, if so, the \u201ccircumstances under which they may do so.\u201dThe appeal over which Pollard resides relates to Khadr\u2019s conviction by a widely condemned military commission in Guantanamo Bay in October 2010. Khadr pleaded guilty to five war crimes he was accused of committing as a 15-year-old in Afghanistan in 2002.The commission sentenced him to a further eight years in prison. He was transferred to Canada to serve out his sentence in 2012 and has been on bail in Alberta for a year pending the outcome of his U.S. appeal, which remains in limbo.His appeal to the Court of Military Commission Review argues in part those offences were not war crimes under either U.S. domestic or international law at the time they were committed. The review court presided over by Pollard has so far refused to deal with the merits of the appeal.An analysis in the Lawfare Blog argues the Pollard issue \u2014 unlikely to be fixed any time soon given the \u201chighly politicized, dysfunctional context\u201d in which the top levels of the U.S. government operate \u2014 is just a \u201csymptom of a broader problem\u201d with the military commissions.\u201cAt nearly every turn, the hastily crafted military commission system shows that being novel and untested comes at a great cost in time, resources and ultimately credibility,\u201d authors Robert Loeb and Helen Klein note.', u'Canada not certain on joining anti-ISIS mission in Libya: VanceOTTAWA \u2013 Canada\u2019s top general says military intervention in Libya is not inevitable.Gen. Jonathan Vance, the chief of the defence staff, says he\u2019s not advocating one way or another for Canada to join a possible western military coalition in Libya.He says it is not inevitable that a new military mission will be needed to get rid of Islamic militants in Libya, but he\u2019s keeping a close watch so he can advise the government.\t\t\t\n\t\tVance says much will depend on the performance of Libya\u2019s new, United Nations-brokered government and what assistance it may ask for.Vance says the foothold gained by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya\u2019s port city of Sirte remains a serious impediment to stabilizing the country.But he says simply throwing military assets at the situation is not a solution on its own.', u'Federal court finds designation of Egyptian man as security threat unreasonableTORONTO \u2014 The Canadian government\u2019s designation of an Egyptian man as a threat to national security is unreasonable, a federal court judge has ruled.The decision in favour of Mahmoud Jaballah, a father of three, could see the end of an ordeal that first saw Canada brand him as a terrorist more than 16 years ago.\u201cI conclude that the security certificate filed by the minister is not reasonable and will be set aside,\u201d Federal Court Judge Dolores Hansen said in her decision.\u201cClassified reasons will also be issued and will include the information that cannot be disclosed for reasons of national security.\u201dThe public reasons for Hansen\u2019s decision were not immediately available Tuesday.The government has long insisted that Mahjoub, now 54, was a ranking member of the Vanguards of Conquest, an Egyptian group linked to al-Qaida. Mahjoub also worked on an agricultural project in Sudan run by former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in the early 1990s.His lawyers argued the government had failed to produce independent evidence that Mahjoub ever committed, or would commit, terrorist acts. They also said Canada\u2019s spy agency had made no attempts to investigate or verify information about him it was given by foreign intelligence services.A beaming Jaballah, of Toronto, who came to Canada in 1995 and was initially granted refugee status, was not immediately able to comment on Hansen\u2019s ruling due to court-imposed conditions, but his lawyer, Marlys Edwardh, told The Canadian Press it had been a long and difficult ordeal.\u201cHe has spent earlier on years in a maximum-security setting, part of it in solitary confinement\u2026merely because of the allegations,\u201d Edwardh said.Jaballah was originally arrested in Canada in 1999 under a highly criticized national security certificate based largely on secret evidence he was not allowed to see. That certificate was quickly deemed unreasonable, but the government issued a second one in 2001, which was upheld in 2003 after the government argued it had new secret evidence against him.In 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the national certificate process to be unfair because of the secrecy, and quashed the certificates but gave the government a year to rewrite the rules. As a result, Ottawa appointed special advocates \u2013 lawyers with top-level security clearance able to review the government\u2019s secret evidence.In 2008, the government issued the third certificate against Jaballah \u2013 the one Hansen has now found unreasonable.\u201cIt is a long, deeply challenging road to have walked,\u201d Edwardh said.In previous years, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service admitted listening in on calls between Mahjoub and his lawyers, and, in 2011, government lawyers mistakenly took files belonging to his defence.Jaballah has said that he was jailed without charge and tortured on several occasions in Egypt. He staved off deportation to Egypt on the basis he would likely be tortured there.\xa0', u'\u2018He\u2019s Teflon\u2019: Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings remain high as Canadians shrug off elbowgateA majority of Canadians say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s \u201celbow incident\u201d in the House of Commons last week was \u201cno big deal,\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.A new poll from Ipsos, conducted in the wake of \xa0on behalf of Global News, revealed that 63 per cent of respondents believed that the incident \u201cis no big deal,\u201d that it \u201cwas a momentary lapse in judgment by the Prime Minister that he has already apologized for\u201d and that \u201cwe should all just move on.\u201dBut a minority (37 per cent) said there was no excuse for Trudeau behaving the way he did, and that the incident \u201craises serious questions about his maturity and judgment.\u201dConservative voters were far more likely to believe this than Liberal voters, with 70 per cent judging it to be a serious issue.The prime minister, for the upcoming G7 summit, found himself apologizing repeatedly in the House of Commons last week after he marched across the centre aisle and grabbed Conservative Whip Gordon Brown, whose path was being blocked by a group of NDP members.Trudeau allegedly swore and then\xa0elbowed the NDP\u2019s Ruth-Ellen Brosseau in the chest during the ensuing fracas. In spite of this,\xa0NDP supporters polled by Ipsos were quite\xa0forgiving, with 56 per cent willing to give Trudeau a pass.That didn\u2019t come as a big\xa0surprise to Darrell Bricker, CEO at Ipsos Global Public Affairs.While had predicted the end of the Liberal \u201choneymoon\u201d and speculated Trudeau\u2019s outburst would lead to a drop\xa0in his personal\xa0approval ratings, the poll does not support this.Six in ten Canadians still approve (19 per cent strongly and 43 per cent somewhat) of the performance of the Liberal government under Trudeau, a drop of four points since the last such survey in March.Meanwhile, four in ten Canadians surveyed by Ipsos disapprove of the government\u2019s performance under Trudeau (17 per cent strongly and 21 per cent somewhat).Other\xa0polls conducted over the past week have yielded similar results. A  survey\xa0after the elbow incident revealed Trudeau has hit an all-time high in terms of who\xa0Canadians prefer as prime minister, with nearly 54 per cent of respondents naming him as their favourite. An\xa0\xa0poll found that 70 per cent of respondents said the\xa0elbowing incident had\xa0no impact on their view of Trudeau.The government also remains\xa0in a very comfortable position\xa0when it comes to voting intention.If an election were held tomorrow, the poll indicates that the Liberals would receive 46 per cent of the decided popular vote compared to 30 per cent for the Tories under Rona Ambrose.The NDP and out-going leader Tom Mulcair would receive 15 per cent support. Approximately 4 per cent would go to the Bloc Quebecois, and 5 per cent to the Greens and other parties.\xa0', u'Gord Downie and the Tragically Hip: A timeline of the iconic Canadian bandTuesday\u2019s announcement that Gord Downie has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer comes as The Tragically Hip readies its 14th album and a farewell tour this summer, which will feature Downie.A specialist treating Downie says the singer is  but has been cleared to perform, as Downie has recovered much of his physical, mental and emotional strength.\t\t\t\n\t\tDownie, 52, is beloved from coast to coast, known for his energetic onstage performances and true dedication to Canada in what is arguably the most Canadian rock band.Here\u2019s a look at the history of one of Canada\u2019s most famous rock bands, from their roots in Kingston to their 14 Juno wins.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWATCH ABOVE: The Tragically Hip\u2019s managers and Dr. James Perry from Sunnybrook health Sciences Centre discuss Gord Downie\u2019s terminal brain cancer diagnosis.', u'ESPN\u2019s Stephen A.

DeMar DeRozan was unstoppable when it counted, I don\u2019t understand why considering that LeBron James had been\xa0on him a couple of times.\u201d\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s inexplicable,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI can\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened to Cleveland right now.

Despres, a naturalized U.S. citizen, had crossed the border despite guards finding him with a small arsenal including a chainsaw, a sword and brass knuckles. He told them he was an assassin on a military mission. Three psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. He was found not criminally responsible in 2008. He is detained in a psychiatric facility inside the Dorchester Penitentiary. Drowned her daughters, ages three and 19 months, in a bathtub in 2006 during a custody battle with her ex-husband. Doctors diagnosed the Barrie, Ont., woman with unspecified psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder from spousal abuse, depression and an eating disorder. The Crown successfully argued her mental illness didn\u2019t prevent her from knowing right from wrong. Campione was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with no parole eligibility for 25 years. Pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Trevor Brewster and second-degree murder of Paul Michael Knott. Race suffered from schizophrenia and was not taking his medicine in May 2007 when he lured the Halifax men to their deaths in separate incidents. Court was told Race believed he was a vampire slayer and a god-like entity at the time of the killings. He was found not criminally responsible, based on a joint recommendation from the Crown and the defence. Killed his three children, ages 10, eight and five, in Merritt, B.C., in April 2008. Schoenborn was diagnosed with delusional disorder and said he killed the children to protect them from an imagined threat of sexual abuse. He was found not criminally responsible and is in a psychiatric hospital in Port Coquitlam. He has been granted escorted day passes from the facility but now faces an application from the Crown to have him designated a \u201chigh-risk accused,\u201d which would force him to wait longer to ask for more freedom. Fatally stabbed and beheaded Tim McLean, the young man sleeping next to him on a Greyhound Bus in Manitoba on July 30, 2008. Li told a mental-health advocate he heard the voice of God telling him McLean was an alien who he needed to destroy. Li was found not criminally responsible and was sent to the Selkirk Mental Health Centre. Li saw his privileges expand slowly after his admission to the facility. In February 2016, Li, now known as Will Baker, won the right to eventually move out of a group home and live on his own. Shot Nancy Michaud, an aide to a Quebec cabinet minister, in the head after taking her hostage while her two children slept in 2008. He took credit cards and banking information and had sex with her corpse. During his trial, he argued he was not criminally responsible because of a mental issue, saying he was on medication at the time of the crime. But he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. Fatally stabbed his three-year-old daughter and five-year-old son in 2009. The Quebec cardiologist was found not criminally responsible and was sent to a psychiatric hospital in Montreal and released in December 2012. An appeals court overturned the verdict; last year, Turcotte was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 17 years. Bludgeoned his wife to death with a hammer, hitting her more than 100 times while they were watching a hockey game in 2010. Court was told he had been hearing voices and medical records showed the Winnipeg man was first diagnosed with severe depression in 2003. The defence\u2019s attempt to argue he was not criminally responsible was unsuccessful. He is serving a life sentence for second-degree murder, with no eligibility for parole for 10 years. Stole a snow plow in the early morning of Jan. 12, 2011, and in the middle of a two-hour rampage with it he hit and killed Toronto police Sgt. Ryan Russell. Witnesses heard him yell about the Taliban, Chinese technology and microchips. He was found not criminally responsible and is held in the secure unit of a mental health hospital near Toronto. Last summer, he lost his bid for unescorted passes into the community but won a move out of the secure unit of his hospital and accompanied visits of up to 10 hours in Durham Region. Killed and dismembered Chinese exchange student Jun Lin in May 2012. Experts testified Magnotta is schizophrenic and was psychotic and out of touch with reality the night of the slaying. But prosecutor Louis Bouthillier said Magnotta had made a promise several months earlier to take the life of a human being. He was found guilty of first-degree murder. Killed Alberta peace officer Rod Lazenby, 62, who had come to his rural property in August 2012 investigate a dog complaint. Kloschinsky was charged with first-degree murder but found not criminally responsible. Queen\u2019s Bench Justice Beth Hughes ruled Kloschinsky\u2019s delusional thinking prevented him from realizing what he was doing was wrong. He is being held at a mental hospital and is subjected to annual reviews.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: \u2018We expect weeks, if not months, fighting this fire\u2019Despite much of the province seeing a cold, wet May long weekend, the Fort McMurray wildfire saw very little rain.The west edge of the fire received between three and five millimetres of rain while the northern edge \u2013 where the fire is most active \u2013 saw none at all.\u201cMost of the growth is in those northern sections,\u201d wildfire manager Chad Morrison said. \u201cThere was no rain received in the north or eastern portions\u2026 In the Fort McMurray area, there was very little rain.\u201dAs of 10 a.m. Tuesday, the wildfire was 522,895 hectares in size.The municipal affairs minister said there were 40 new wildfire starts on Monday.Morrison said the fire continued to spread to the forested areas northeast of the city and the oil facilities. It has crossed into Saskatchewan and burned 2,496 hectares in that province.\u201cThe fire is now being fought on both sides of the border,\u201d Morrison said.He added while crews continue to build up fire guards, create barriers and make good progress, the region has not received significant rain in two to three months.\u201cWe expect the potential for extreme wildfire conditions to occur,\u201d he explained.The forecast was calling for warmer days ahead, so officials said suppression efforts will be a challenge and air quality continues to be a concern.An additional 1,000 firefighters should be on the ground in the next two weeks from other parts of Canada, the United States and other parts of the world.There are currently 1,200 firefighters on scene, the majority of which are Alberta crews being rotated through. This week, firefighters\xa0from across parts of Canada, and the U.S., including Alaska, will arrive. Next week, international crews, including 280 firefighters from South Africa are expected to arrive.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been in contact with our partners nationally and internationally,\u201d Morrison said.However, after not receiving as much rain as hoped for over the weekend, officials made the call to bring in outside crews.\u201cWith the cooler conditions, we have the ability to safety deploy some of those experienced firefighters,\u201d Morrison explained.\u201cWe have more safe places to put boots on the ground.\u201dCommercial air service is tentatively scheduled to resume at the Fort McMurray International Airport on June 10.\u201cYMM is the gateway to our community,\u201d Scott Clements, Fort McMurray Airport Authority president and CEO, said. \u201cMy colleagues and I look forward to reopening following the devastating wildfires.\u201dThe return of commercial air service is contingent on several factors, including the airspace requirements of the province as the fire fight continues and the voluntary re-entry date for residents.\u201cSafety is our first priority and while every effort will be made to adhere to this opening date, residents are reminded that this will only occur if conditions for re-entry are safe,\u201d Clements said.Passengers booked on flights prior to June 10 should contact their airlines for rebooking information.The RCMP said Tuesday its\xa0Wood Buffalo detachment was back up and running out of the Timberlea building on the north side of Fort McMurray.The building had been\xa0closed over air quality concerns but the majority of the local detachment\u2019s personnel have now returned to work on a regular shift schedule.There are still 79 members from other Alberta RCMP detachments working in Fort McMurray to help with security patrols.All personnel are staying in accommodations outside the evacuation zone.\u201cHaving a fully-functioning detachment and our people back on the job is great news for the RCMP and this community,\u201d Supt.\xa0Rob McCloy\xa0said. \u201cWe know that people are understandably concerned about the property they left behind, and we are working hard to keep the things safe until they can come home.\u201dWhenever possible, it is RCMP practice to relieve employees who are personally affected by a local emergency as soon as is possible. However, RCMP said\xa0McCloy \u201cinsisted on contributing to emergency operations, where his knowledge of the city and its people proved invaluable.\u201d\u201cWe are still on track for a voluntary re-entry beginning June 1,\u201d Scott Long, executive director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency said.He stressed there is still a lot of work to be done and that many services will not be available at that time and residents should be prepared.\u201cThere is still an awful lot of work that\u2019s being done in terms of environmental testing,\u201d Long said.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s going non-stop 24-7.\u201d He added there will be information centres established in each neighbourhood\xa0for residents when they come back.Restoration of the hospital resumed Sunday, water quality sampling equipment is being installed in the Athabasca and Clear Water rivers,  to more than 90 per cent of the community, and natural gas is restored to more than 99 per cent of homes.\u201cProgress is being made on safe drinking water but a boil water advisory remains in effect,\u201d Larivee said.A  has been posted on the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo\u2019s website. It includes safety instructions and other information for returning residents.Officials will also conduct a re-entry practice run before June 1 to make sure everything goes smoothly.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the traffic control plan to get close to 80,000 people back to Fort McMurray in a short period of time,\u201d Long explained.Jim Mandeville has been on the ground for two weeks with FirstOnSite Restoration. He said residents should be prepared for a few things upon their return.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a smell. There\u2019s going to some minor cleaning that\u2019s required and unfortunately, for a lot of people who\u2019ve been without power, there\u2019s going to be an even worse smell from the refrigerator,\u201d he explained.Mandeville said even the satellite photos won\u2019t fully prepare people for what to expect in person.\u201cI\u2019ve been in a few commercial structures around the city \u2013\xa0ones that\xa0are really close to the fire \u2013 where there\u2019s very little odour, etc. and some that are further away, there\u2019s a lot more odour inside,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we can tell from aerial pictures.\u201dThe pre-loaded debit card distribution centres have been moved to Alberta Works offices across Alberta, including four each in Edmonton and Calgary.The province hopes to have something in place soon for people who are out-of-province. Larivee stressed there is no deadline.\u201cIf you qualify, you will get it.\u201dOn Monday, the Regional Emergency Operations Centre endorsed the province\u2019s recommendation to allow phased re-entry to several camps north and south of Fort McMurray.\u201cRight now, I know from our oil and gas partners\u2026 they are looking at their re-entry plan, they are well aware of the criteria,\u201d Long said. \u201cThere is no set time line.\u201dHe stressed worker safety is the number one priority.The REOC supported the suggestion from Alberta Agriculture and Forestry that assessments of the following sites could begin:AOSTRA Road corridor:Highway 63 (south of Fort McMurray) corridor:People will not be allowed to stay in the camps until Alberta Agriculture and Forestry and Alberta Health Services inspections have been done to ensure conditions are safe.', u'Nearly 40% of Canadian homeowners struggle to pay monthly bills, survey findsSurging house prices have left nearly four in 10 Canadian homeowners with lots of equity, but unable to cover their monthly expenses at least once this past year, according to a new survey released Tuesday.The survey from Manulife Bank of Canada found that while 37 per cent of those asked say they were \u201ccaught short\u201d when it came to covering their basic living costs, another 60 per cent are worried they will not have enough saved for retirement.\u201cThere\u2019s a significant segment in Canada today that as a result of house prices are either struggling on day to day expenses or have not even begun to think about retirement or how they are going to thrive in their retirement years,\u201d said Manulife Bank chief executive officer Rick Lunny.The survey found the average Canadian homeowner with a mortgage has an outstanding balance of $181,000, up from $175,000 reported last fall. Vancouver tops all provinces when it comes to average mortgage debt outstanding at $259,000; followed by Calgary and Edmonton at $217,000; Toronto at $194,000; and Montreal at $156,000.Of those who said they had been caught short on cash to pay their monthly expenses, Manulife says Canadians often turn to more expensive forms of debt.Manulife says homeowners who find themselves with limited savings may have to make difficult choices when it comes to retirement, including: retiring later, accepting a lower standard of living in retirement or moving to a less expensive home and use their home equity to fund retirement.\u201cA disproportionate amount of people are looking to their house as their retirement plan, which might have worked for a few lucky people in Toronto or Vancouver 20 or 30 years ago but that is not sound financial planning,\u201d said Lunny.The first step Canadians need to take to control their finances is to figure out where they are spending their money, Lunny said.\u201cEverybody hates doing budgets. I get that, but a $4 latte every day of the week or a gym membership these things add up,\u201d he said.\xa0\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the impact it has on their current ability to meet their needs or perhaps more importantly their retirement needs.\u201dThe Manulife Bank of Canada poll surveyed 2,373 Canadian homeowners in all provinces between ages 20 to 59 with household income of $50,000 or more.

Anyone who\u2019s ever been to a Hip concert can attest to the vibe of the crowd. Arguably, The Hip is\xa0the most \u201cCanadian\u201d band out there, with\xa0Canadianisms peppered throughout their music and\xa0countless references to Canadian locales.Even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agrees with that assessment.Downie and the other members of the band \u2014 Paul Langlois, Rob Baker, Gord Sinclair and Johnny Fay \u2014 are planning a 2016 farewell summer tour to honour Downie and the band\u2019s legacy.Here\u2019s a selection of Downie\u2019s lyrics, illustrating his love for Canada. (Note: these barely scratch the surface, there are so many.)While Downie\u2019s diagnosis is a sad thing, The Hip has created some of the country\u2019s best rock tunes, and we\u2019re choosing to celebrate the band for all that it\u2019s given to music.Break out your Canadian flags, because we\u2019ve put together a Spotify Tragically Hip playlist for all the fans out there:Toronto\u2019s  started the hashtag \u201c#GordIsGreat,\u201d and fans have been replying to that on Twitter with their favourite Hip songs. The radio station is taking Tragically Hip requests all day Tuesday.\u201cMy favourite Tragically Hip song is . It\u2019s clean, easygoing and its effortless groove rolls on like stream water over rocks.\xa0 It feels like Canada.\u201d\u201cThe first thing that sticks out in my mind when it comes to The Hip, putting aside what a kind, funny, interesting and intelligent man Gord is \u2026 is the song .I had just started playing it at around\xa06 p.m. on Feb. 27\xa02010, right at the very second Sidney Crosby scored the overtime winner in the gold medal game of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic hockey tournament. Moments later, thousands of people spilled out into the streets and celebrated at Yonge Dundas Square. I loved that moment so much and that song will forever be linked to it in my mind, a song about a goal everyone remembers as the new goal everyone remembers was happening. It felt serendipitous.\u2018..We all squeezed the stick and we all pulled the trigger\u2026'\u201d\u201cMy song is . As you may know, I ran away from home a couple of years ago. In what ended up being a bout of clinical depression (which I didn\u2019t realize at the time), I quit my job and my relationship. I had 600 songs on my beat up iPhone 4, one of which was .I couldn\u2019t listen to the song because it made me homesick. It brought me back to Canada, to my family, to my friends. To campfires and cannonballs and long prairie drives. One night  came on shuffle while the phone was hooked up to a crappy speaker. I was in India, and earlier that night I was feeding children who literally lived in potato sacks in the street. I was burnt out, and broke. I had been robbed twice that month. \xa0I had met a girl from Belgium who immediately tried to change the song.\u2018Not the song with the birds! She\u2019s going to cry and talk about Canada for the next hour!\u2019 she said. \u2018IT\u2019S A LOON!\u2019 I said. \u2018AND CANADA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD!\u2019I did cry, but they\xa0were happy tears, because there was a time when I never thought it would happen, but I realized it was time for me to go home.\u201d\u201cMy favourite memory of Gord and The Tragically Hip would be when they performed in The Wolf\u2019s backyard with Big Music Fest in Bobcaygeon in June of 2011. The sun went down and  lit up to the sweet sound of  in Bobcaygeon, Ontario.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve worked in rock radio for nearly 15 years, but more importantly have been a die-hard fan of The Tragically Hip for as long as I\u2019ve been listening to music. The Hip were always one of those bands that my brothers and I agreed upon. We\u2019d pack the car with our tent and \u201cadventure kit\u201d and drive to Barrie or wherever they were playing that summer, and rejoice in knowing every single song in the set list, let alone on the CD player. It was almost a religion to our core group of friends. I know people who have seen The Hip over a hundred times.It\u2019s so bittersweet knowing it will most certainly be their last album. Millions of fans around the world are reeling with sadness, but being a member of the media as well as The Tragically Hip\u2019s worldwide fan club, I feel the need to celebrate. To not dwell on the future, but to live in the moment, and celebrate a career and soundtrack to some of the most personal and poignant songs I have ever known. I finally got to meet Gord Downie during the last tour for . I told him how much I loved the new record, and that made him smile. Gord seems to be a pretty serious guy, but watching him on stage that night, it was if there was a natural connection between he and his fans, an understanding that this is what he was meant to be. A performer. A ringleader. Someone to be loved by the masses. That\u2019s what chokes me up. The fact that I might not have the chance to witness that ever again in this lifetime. That being said, I will do my best to get online and buy tickets for one of those shows. Hopefully I\u2019ll get to witness the spectacle once more. If not, I have plenty of amazing memories that I will cherish forever.My favourite songs are , , , , and .\u201d Q107\u2019s John Derringer weighs in on Gord Downie\u2019s cancer diagnosis\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t", u'Tragically Hip fans share lyrics, messages of hope after Gord Downie cancer diagnosisFans of Canadian rock legend Gord Downie and The Tragically Hip took to social media Tuesday to share messages of heartbreak, admiration and hope after the band revealed Downie was diagnosed with terminal brain caner in December.In a letter addressed to fans, the band said their frontman\xa0has been fighting hard over the last few months with friends and family by his side.

It\u2019s highly prevalent, inordinately drug-resistant, and clinics aren\u2019t testing for it \u2014 until recently there was no standardized test available.Its symptoms are easily mistaken for chlamydia or gonorrhea. But treating Mycoplasma genitalium\xa0with antibiotics aimed at other\xa0infections just makes things worse,\xa0killing weaker bugs and fostering colonies of resilient superbugs. co-authored  documenting the first proof the increasingly common STI is proliferating in Canada \u2014 in Toronto, specifically.The  tested 1,193 men and women at a Toronto STI clinic. About 4.5 per cent of the men and 3.2 per cent of the women tested positive\xa0for Mycoplasma genitalium.\xa0That sounds small but it would make this one of the most common STIs out there \u2014\xa0more than\xa010 times the rate of\xa0syphilis.While almost 97 per cent of syphilis cases are among men, Gesink said, Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence is much evenly distributed\xa0between genders.And a high proportion of the people tested had drug-resistant strains of Mycoplasma genitalium: 58 per cent were resistant to the antibiotic macrolide; 20 per cent were resistant to fluoroquinolone.That\u2019s a problem. The more you use second-line treatments, the more quickly those treatments can become ineffective.\u201cThere\u2019s\xa0Plan B\xa0and Plan C\xa0if the original treatment doesn\u2019t work.\xa0But you really don\u2019t want to go back down the line like that,\u201d Gesink said.Researchers are only beginning to find out what  does to you if it isn\u2019t effectively treated quickly. They believe it causes pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and epididymitis (inflammation of a coiled tube\xa0that stores and carries sperm).Inflammation caused by this infection can also increase your risk of contracting HIV: Inflamed tissue is more easily torn or abraded.\xa0If you\u2019re infected while pregnant, Gesink said, it can also cause pre-term labour.And STI clinics aren\u2019t testing for it.But\xa0now that she and her fellow researchers have come up with a way to detect Mycoplasma genitalium fairly reliably, Gesink would like to see Ontario and other provinces\xa0use that test widely. Otherwise the disease will keep going undetected and un-treated or under-treated.\u201cThey have the equipment to do it, now, and\xa0they have the test,\u201d she said.: Ontario\u2019s 15-year syphilis outbreak is now considered \u201cmature\u201d; Alberta officially declared syphilis and gonorrhea outbreaks last month after syphilis infections soared. Syphilis rates among Edmonton men, in particular, quadrupled within a year.Epidemiologists, clinicians and public health officials are still trying to figure out what exactly is behind the outbreak.These diseases\u2019 spread could be facilitated by fluid, mobile sexual networks that get more tangled \u2014 and  \u2014 thanks to hookup tools that put you in touch with people you might otherwise not find and whom you might not keep in touch with.It could also be a matter of people being less risk-averse thanks to advances in testing for, treating and preventing STIs.', u'Dozens of real estate companies fail to comply with anti-money-laundering lawsTORONTO \u2013 At least 85 real estate companies have not implemented a plan showing how they are trying to detect money laundering and other suspicious transactions, nearly 15 years after they were required to do so, according to data obtained by The Canadian Press.The federal anti-money laundering agency received 337 compliance reports from roughly 1,000 companies in the real estate sector it surveyed \u2014 including brokers, sales representatives and developers \u2014 between Jan. 1, 2013, and Feb. 8, 2016.The data, which was obtained through an access-to-information request, represents only a small sampling of the real estate industry. There are about 20,000 companies in the real estate sector that are required to report to Fintrac.An analysis of the data contained in those reports found that roughly a quarter of the 337 respondents admitted they had not yet fully implemented a compliance regime, which has been required by federal anti-money laundering laws since 2001.Thirty-eight of the companies said they had only partially implemented a compliance regime, while the other 47 said they had not even begun to do so. The names of the companies were not included in the documents.Fintrac spokesman Darren Gibb says some of the reports weren\u2019t sent back because the companies no longer exist, while others simply failed to respond.Fintrac routinely sends out compliance reports to various sectors to gather information about the companies it regulates, says Gibb.Those reports can sometimes lead to further enforcement actions such as on-site examinations, he says.\u201cIf we see an assessment report come back and it\u2019s clear that the entity is not where they should be, then certainly that\u2019s a flag for us that it may be examination-worthy,\u201d says Gibb.\u201cOr conversely, if we don\u2019t get an assessment report coming back, that\u2019s potentially an even bigger flag.\u201dIf violations are discovered during an examination, that could lead to fines of up to $100,000 per violation for individuals and up to $500,000 per violation for companies, depending on severity.Gibb was unable to specify how many of the 85 companies that did not have a compliance plan were fined, noting that the reports are only one factor that the agency considers when deciding whether to investigate a particular firm.The largest number of firms that admitted they have yet to finish implementing a compliance regime was in Quebec, where there were 32 such companies.Gibb said he could not speculate as to why the figure was higher in Quebec than in other provinces.In Ontario, 19 firms said they hadn\u2019t fully implemented a compliance regime, while in Alberta there were 12 such cases. Eight of the B.C. real estate firms surveyed reported that they hadn\u2019t finished setting up a compliance regime.Meanwhile, 43 of the companies surveyed nationwide said they had not yet appointed a compliance officer, as required by law.Ottawa also requires companies subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to have a system in place for training their employees on how to comply with the law.The data obtained by The Canadian Press found that 42 of the 337 companies surveyed by Fintrac had only started implementing a training system, while 57 had not even begun yet.Pierre Leduc, a spokesman for the Canadian Real Estate Association, says keeping up with the changes to anti-money laundering laws is a challenge for the real estate sector because most realtors work on their own and are not big corporations like banks or casinos.\u201cIn addition, until recently, awareness was low, which is why CREA embarked on a national information tour to raise awareness and explain compliance responsibilities,\u201d Leduc said in an email.', u'Gord Downie, The Tragically Hip lead singer, diagnosed with terminal brain cancerTORONTO \u2013 Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie is determined to \u201cblow people\u2019s minds\u201d with a raucous Canadian tour in the wake of learning he has an incurable brain cancer, his managers said Tuesday as fans tried to digest the shocking announcement about the singer\u2019s illness.Band managers Patrick Sambrook and Bernie Breen said doctors have cleared the 52-year-old father of four to hit the road following surgery and treatment for  to start in the brain.The details of the tour are set to be announced Wednesday.\u201cThe will to do the tour, that was easy,\u201d Sambrook said at a press conference also attended by Downie\u2019s neuro-oncologist, Dr. James Perry.\u201cThe (question was): \u2018Can we do this?\u2019 and \u2018Can we do it to the level that (we want)?\u2019 It\u2019s a pro band, Gord absolutely doesn\u2019t want to go out there unless he can really do his thing and so I mean, their head space, his head space is: \u2018We want to blow people\u2019s minds.\u201d\u2018Perry, head of neurology at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to offer a prognosis but added Downie\u2019s case is especially receptive to treatment, suggesting \u201ca significantly higher chance of longer-term survival.\u201dBut the physician also said Downie\u2019s tumour, found in his front left temporal lobe, is impossible to completely remove by surgery and frequently recurs.\u201cUnfortunately, one day it will come back,\u201d said Perry, dismissing the possibility of a complete recovery.Downie was diagnosed in December after suffering a seizure. Surgery removed the bulk of the tumour, while six weeks of radiation and chemotherapy \u2013 completed about a month and a half ago \u2013 have reduced it even further.\u201cHe has returned to his physical, emotional, mental strength well enough now to be able to get back doing what he loves doing,\u201d Perry said of the charismatic frontman, known for powerful live performances and poetic lyrics.\t\t\t\n\t\tPerry didn\u2019t anticipate any medical issues in the short term, but said \u201cmedical contingencies\u201d will be in place throughout the tour. He emphasized that Downie will need to avoid fatigue while on stage.\u201cWe all know he doesn\u2019t sit down in a rocking chair and play banjo, so I think we have to be cautious about things like hydration,\u201d Perry said.Neither Downie nor his bandmates attended the press conference. The Kingston, Ont., band  and by press release Tuesday morning.\u201cThis feels like the right thing to do now, for Gord, and for all of us,\u201d said the Hip, whose cerebral smashes include \u201cBlow at High Dough\u201d and \u201cNew Orleans Is Sinking,\u201d in announcing the tour.\u201cWhat we in the Hip receive, each time we play together, is a connection; with each other; with music and its magic; and during the shows, a special connection with all of you, our incredible fans. So, we\u2019re going to dig deep, and try to make this our best tour yet.\u201dThe Tragically Hip\u2019s 14th studio album, \u201cMan Machine Poem,\u201d is set for release on June 17. The album was largely completed prior to Downie learning about the tumour, his manager said.Breen said playing music together is what \u201cthey feel best doing as a group.\u201d\xa0\u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate and honestly awesome for everybody involved, to give and receive what happens when this band plays live and what they mean to people and the people to them,\u201d said Breen.\u201cThe hope is that this particular run is like most, which\u2019ll be great and awesome and exciting and everyone will be happy at the end.\u201dGlioblastoma affects about two to three people per 100,000 in Canada, the United States and Europe, according to information supplied by Sunnybrook.

She also assured that Canada will continue to defend humanitarian principles.', u'Trudeau tries to woo Japanese automakers ahead of G7 SummitTOKYO \u2013 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally invited Japanese auto executives Tuesday in Tokyo to invest more in Canada.But it\u2019s unclear whether he will secure concrete commitments from the companies on his first trip to Japan since taking office last fall.Trudeau met with auto parts manufacturers and the presidents of three auto companies: Honda, Toyota and Subaru.The CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries, the firm that makes Subaru, told Trudeau he doesn\u2019t have any plans to expand capacity in the near term, though he might in the future, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary Cameron Ahmad said after the meeting.\u201cThank you for agreeing to meet with us,\u201d Trudeau said to Yasuyuki Yoshinaga after they exchanged greetings at the residence of Canada\u2019s ambassador to Japan.\u201cI look forward to talking about tremendous opportunities to create success for Canada and for Japan through economic engagement.\u201dUnlike Toyota and Honda, Subaru does not have an operation in Canada.As part of his pitch, the prime minister also told Yoshinaga that Canadians are innovative and focused on high quality.Trudeau will also sit down Tuesday with his Japanese counterpart to discuss the countries\u2019 business ties as well as security co-operation before the Group of Seven summit later this week.His agenda for his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe includes issues like investment, education and trade, such as the huge 12-country treaty known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, visited the Meiji Shrine and will meet the emperor and empress of Japan before the prime minister sits down with Abe.For his part, Abe is expected to raise a pressing subject for the Japanese: regional security.Japan is deeply concerned about North Korea\u2019s recent nuclear tests and missile launches as well as an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea.Following their meeting in February, Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida issued a statement reconfirming their commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in international maritime law.Without naming China, they also said they opposed the use of intimidation, force or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific.When it comes to China, Keio University law professor Masayuki Tadokoro said Japan will listen carefully to Trudeau\u2019s words on the matter. The concern is Canada may not want to take very strong position due its economic interests in China.\u201cCanada has always been watching toward the east and south because Canada is an Atlantic state,\u201d Kenjiro Monji, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in an interview last week.\u201cCanada is also a Pacific nation and it is only recently that Canadians started to look to the west, but only through economic lenses.\u201dAbe is also expected to urge Trudeau to move quickly to open up Canadian liquefied natural gas exports to Japan.Japan, the world\u2019s biggest importer of LNG, is hoping Canada will issue necessary environmental permits to allow companies to export it from British Columbia.Monji said LNG is still very important energy source for his country, which makes Canada one of the most promising potential exporters to Japan. He noted that Japanese companies are involved in several LNG projects in Canada.Trudeau\u2019s Tokyo visit comes ahead of the G7 summit on Thursday and Friday in Ise-Shima.', u'Trudeau celebrates wedding anniversary in Japan before attending G7 summitTOKYO \u2013 Justin Trudeau\u2019s trip to Japan for bilateral talks and the t will be about more than just business.The prime minister isn\u2019t planning to hold any meetings or events Wednesday, so he can celebrate his 11th wedding anniversary with his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau.The couple will spend the night at a traditional Japanese inn \u2013 or ryokan \u2013 before Trudeau heads to the G7 summit on Thursday in the country\u2019s Ise-Shima region.\u201cThe fact of the matter is we\u2019ve been working extremely hard today and will be at the G7 meetings on Thursday and Friday, and in the middle of all this, I\u2019m taking a moment to celebrate \u2013 on personal funds \u2013 my wedding anniversary with my wife,\u201d Trudeau said of the down time when asked during a news conference whether it would cost taxpayers anything, including the potential financial burden of idle staffers.\u201cThis is the kind of work-life balance that I\u2019ve often talked about as being essential in order to be able to be in service of the country with all one\u2019s very best and that\u2019s certainly something I\u2019m going to continue to make sure we do.\u201dGregoire Trudeau accompanied the prime minister Tuesday in Tokyo during visits to the Meiji Shrine and with the Japanese emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace.She also joined him Tuesday evening for dinner with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Trudeau held working meetings earlier in the day with Abe and executives from the Japanese auto sector.', u'Kids in crisis need more money, says Marie-Claude BibeauOTTAWA \u2013 Canada\u2019s development minister says the world must do more to educate children forced from their homes as it grapples with the epic level of humanitarian disaster unfolding across the globe.Marie-Claude Bibeau tells The Canadian Press that too little of the already insufficient amount of global humanitarian assistance is being directed to educate these children.And she says unless more money is spent on them, more children will lose out on education and become drawn to extremism, creating serious security threats.\xa0Bibeau was speaking from the first  in Istanbul on Monday, where she announced a $274 million Canadian contribution.The two-day gathering is a major effort address what the United Nations says is the highest level of humanitarian unrest in the world since the end of the Second World War.Bibeau is Canada\u2019s representative to the summit that is trying to find new ways of coping with the estimated 125 million people that require humanitarian assistance, including 60 million of them displaced from their homes.', u'Phased re-entry plan for oilsands camps near Fort McMurray beginsAssessment work to return a number of oilsands camps to operations has begun.On Monday, the Regional Emergency Operations Centre endorsed the province\u2019s recommendation to allow phased re-entry to several camps north and south of Fort McMurray.The REOC supported the suggestion from Alberta Agriculture and Forestry that assessments of the following sites could begin:AOSTRA Road corridor:Highway 63 (south of Fort McMurray) corridor:People will not be allowed to stay in the camps until Alberta Agriculture and Forestry and Alberta Health Services inspections have been done to ensure conditions are safe.\u201cThe phased re-entry for all oilsands camps in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo is now underway,\u201d a news release from the region said Monday.Syncrude spokesperson Will Gibson said there are currently 150 people on site to assess and check on different plants and equipment.\u201cWe haven\u2019t shut down our operation since we began production in 1978.\u201d\u201cThis is going to be a big job,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt is somewhat unprecedented but we\u2019re committed to doing it safely. And we\u2019re committed to getting it right.\u201dHe said there are also emergency responders at Syncrude facilities and stressed safety is the number one priority.Syncrude is not yet releasing any specific timelines for this\xa0process.The re-entry plan comes after the camps were evacuated by fire May 16.

The Fort McMurray area did not see nearly that much.\u201cInitially the forecast was calling for more precipitation but it sort of skirted the Fort McMurray area and we haven\u2019t seen as much as we thought there was going to be,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cbut the forecast continues to call for increased humidity, cooler, damper temperatures with rain.\u201dThe fire remained out-of-control and Fort McMurray is still restricted to authorized personnel only. Workers returning to Alberta oilsands sites are permitted to head north on Highway 63, which passes through Fort McMurray, but have been told there is no access to the city at this point.Any residents who were part of the evacuation and left driver\u2019s licences or ID cards behind can request a new, free one .\xa0', u'Notley gets kudos in handling Fort McMurray wildfire crisis, but hard work yet to comeEDMONTON \u2013 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is getting high marks for leadership in handling the Fort McMurray wildfire crisis, but political observers say the disaster remains a dicey political proposition with limited upside and a lot of downside.Political scientist Duane Bratt says the process of getting people back into their homes and getting aid and reconstruction money will tell the tale on how Notley will be remembered in the long term for her handling of the crisis.\u201cOn the political side \u2026 if you handle it well, it\u2019s a short term blip,\u201d said Bratt, a political scientist with Mount Royal University in Calgary. \u201cIf you screw it up, it never goes away.\u201dAbout 80,000 evacuees begin returning in phases to Fort McMurray\xa0on June 1, almost a month after a raging blaze broke through the\xa0firelines and destroyed 2,400 structures, most of them houses.Since then Notley has become the face and focus of efforts to contain the blaze, save the city, and get it back on its feet.She has given almost daily updates for three weeks.It\u2019s been an organizational challenge orchestrated on the fly on multiple tracks: getting the evacuees out and fire crews in, securing the area from looting, and finding temporary homes for the displaced in Lac la Biche, Edmonton and beyond.Preloaded debit cards were being handed out a week after the evacuation.Notley met with oilsands officials to consult and calm concerns about production. She toured the city twice, once with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and afterward received Trudeau\u2019s pledge to expand employment insurance coverage.There was benefit to be derived from the past experiences of major disasters in the province \u2014 a wildfire that destroyed a third of Slave Lake in 2011 and massive flooding that displaced thousands in Calgary and southern Alberta in 2013.\u201cShe\u2019s handled this as well as can be expected,\u201d said Bratt. \u201cHad any of that had gone wrong she would\u2019ve taken the blame, so she gets the credit here as well.\u201dBratt said the evacuation itself was a masterstroke, with more than 80,000 people successfully getting out on the one north-south road out of the city.Notley has also been credited for her work with her political rival, Opposition Leader Brian Jean of the Wildrose party. Jean, who represents Fort McMurray in the legislature member, saw his own home destroyed in the fire.Both Bratt and Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown agree Jean has done an admirable job, pushing Notley and her government on their fire-fighting and reconstruction efforts and on personifying the impact of the disaster.\u201cFor those Albertans that actually don\u2019t know anyone in Fort Mac, they know Brian Jean and they know his story,\u201d said Brown.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take a room in a refugee centre and he wouldn\u2019t take a hotel room. Through it all, he\u2019s still putting his constituents first.\u201dBoth Notley and Jean have been credited for working together in the crisis, but Brown said that will inevitably change as the crisis moves into reimbursement, insurance and rebuilding.\u201cAs difficult as this situation has been, there haven\u2019t been a lot of hard choices,\u201d said Brown. \u201cYou just do what needs to be done.\u201cAs we get further and further along, the choices will get harder. It will be harder to please everybody. It will be harder to know exactly what the right thing to do is.\u201dBratt agreed, saying if evacuees remain out of their homes for extended periods or if aid money doesn\u2019t arrive in timely fashion, opinions will change.There\u2019s also the final financial tally for a province that is already running more than $10 billion in deficit this year.\u201cThe longer this drags out, the more things get complicated,\u201d said Bratt.', u'\u2018The war on STIs has failed\u2019: Reinventing the way we tackle sexual diseaseAmeeta Singh\u2019s patients should know better.The  is seeing more people with more severe sexually transmitted infections \u2014 young men with chlamydia and hemorrhagic proctitis who say they\u2019ve had 30-odd partners in the past six months and didn\u2019t use condoms half the time; seemingly healthy people who\u2019ve been on intensive HIV treatment for ages and\xa0have contracted syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis C from unprotected sex.We\u2019re better at treating, preventing and screening for sexually transmitted infections than ever before. But Canadian communities are seeing historic levels\xa0of syphilis and gonorrhea.Ontario\u2019s had sky-high syphilis rates for so long, it\u2019s what  calls\xa0a \u201cmature epidemic.\u201d  and is increasingly resistant to the only drugs we have to treat it.Last month . The province\u2019s infectious syphilis rates more than doubled between 2014 and 2015 after several years of slow growth \u2014 even as .In Alberta, , the jump in STIs was overwhelmingly among men.Gonorrhea has also increased, albeit not as steeply and with less of a gender disparity.And there\u2019s a significant disparity between .Edmonton has seen by far the biggest increase and highest rates, almost doubling Calgary, which is second-highest.The infectious syphilis rate among men in Edmonton rose the most dramatically \u2014 it more than quadrupled in a single\xa0year:\u201cThe biggest rise in infectious syphilis cases has been among men who have sex with men, although we are seeing cases in heterosexual persons, as well,\u201d Singh said.\u201cThere\u2019ve been a number of reasons put forward to try and explain that rise.\u201dAlberta\u2019s also seeing a spike in STI rates among people 40 years old and up \u2014 what Singh calls their \u201csecond peak\u201d in sexual activity.Between 2011 and 2015, syphilis rates among people aged 40 to 44 increased more than 2,000 per cent.The second-steepest increase was among people 60 and over.Chlamydia rates haven\u2019t increased nearly as much, but they increased the most among people 60 and over:\u201cThere\u2019s a second peak in sexual activity\u201d for people over 40, Singh said.And in this respect, age does not bring wisdom or risk aversion (or an affinity for condom use).Singh also suspects people are having unprotected sex because they\u2019re less afraid of contracting HIV, which has become much easier to treat and, with the advent of \xa0(PrEP), easier to prevent.About a quarter of the infectious syphilis cases in Alberta\xa0are among people who are HIV-positive, Singh said. In Ontario,Or, as Gesink sees it, fear around HIV \u201cdwarfs the other STIs. And you can only stress about so many things before you reach stress fatigue.\u201d, who made a name for himself internationally through his work in , does not buy\xa0the hypothesis that advances in tackling HIV/AIDS have made people have riskier sex.\u201cThe truth is that whenever this issue has been monitored carefully there is no evidence that people change their behaviour as a result of accessing treatment or even pre-exposure prophylaxis.\u201dWe\u2019ve got the causation backwards, Montaner says: If we\u2019re seeing high STI rates among people who are on PrEP, Montaner said, that\u2019s because PrEP is given to people with epidemiologically riskier sex lives.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a circular argument.\u201dThere have always been risks associated with sex and that\u2019s never stopped people from having sex, Montaner said: Lack of contraception doesn\u2019t make people celibate, it just makes it more likely they\u2019ll have an unplanned pregnancy. And while the spectre of a generation decimated by AIDS\xa0horrified people three decades ago, people didn\u2019t stop having sex because there wasn\u2019t yet an effective HIV treatment.\u201cThere is a spectrum: There\xa0are people that are much more reserved in their sexual practices and there are others that are not,\u201d Montaner said.As\xa0a consultant and research in gay men\u2019s health with the , Jody Jollimore\u2019s job is helping people work though\xa0that risk-reward calculus.\u201cThe public health message: get tested more often. Make people feel comfortable enough to talk about their sex to their healthcare provider.\u201dShame and stigma, he noted, \u201cstop people from getting tested.\u201dThe problem is the same as it\u2019s always been, Montaner said: People like having sex. Many would rather have sex without condoms. Health advances have\xa0come up with ways of mitigating the risk of pregnancy and HIV transmission; we\u2019re now up against a host of other diseases.Montaner\u2019s already started looking: He and researchers from the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS have  \u2014 to treat people and lower the likelihood they\u2019re infected again.\u201cHow afraid do you have to be to not jaywalk? \u2026 It just doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he said.\u201cEducation is the better way to go and help people to make better choices, support them in making better choices.\xa0And for those that cannot, will not and are not interested, we need to have a more effective compassionate\xa0approach.\u201d', u'Safe sex misconceptions: Things you should know about STIsCanadian communities \u2014 and much of the world \u2014 are in the grips of a historic outbreak of sexually transmitted infections.We asked an STI clinician and an epidemiologist\xa0for some tips, and the things\xa0they wish people knew. You can\u2019t get diseases though oral sex. You can contract gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, HPV and herpes simplex virus from any oral-genital contact. It\u2019s very difficult to transmit HIV through oral sex, however \u2014 0.01 per cent risk if you\u2019re giving, 0.05-0.1 per cent if you\u2019re receiving. If you feel fine, you\u2019re fine. Most STIs are asymptomatic. The only way to know if you have them is to get tested. You\u2019ll know if your sexual partner has an STI by looking at them. Nope. You can get STIs from toilet seats.\xa0Nope. If you only have sex with someone once you\u2019re probably fine. Any kind of sexual contact with someone, even if it\u2019s only once, can get you infected. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of sex you\u2019re having \u2014 if it\u2019s unprotected, it\u2019s unprotected. Sexual contact involving any kind of abrasion\xa0\u2014 from a canker to a cut \u2014 increases the likelihood of transmission. Getting an STI once means you\u2019re immune later. Nope. (Some strains of chlamydia may confer a degree of protection from re-infection, but for syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis you can get infected again and again.) If you\u2019re not having sex with a new person every night, you don\u2019t need to get tested. You should get tested between sexual partners, right after getting a new partner, and once every three to six months if you\u2019re having sex with multiple people over that period of time. If you\u2019re in a long-term, monogamous relationship, you can get tested whenever you get regular physicals. Women get tested when they get pap smears. You should ask to get tested when this procedure is done.', u'Tracking sexually transmitted infections in a Tinder ageDating apps are an easy target when it comes to placing blame for the .But .The internet factor does more than facilitate casual sex: It makes it tougher to\xa0track down\xa0the former sexual partners of infected people, which makes it tougher to track and prevent an illness from spreading.\u201cIf we can\u2019t reach contacts at all, then there\u2019s no way for us to let them know that they have been named,\u201d\xa0says Ameeta Singh, an infectious disease specialist who works at an Edmonton STI clinic.If you\u2019re diagnosed with a reportable, communicable illness, a public health nurse will ask you for a list of your recent sexual partners so they can follow up with them. (They don\u2019t tell the people they call who named them.)This used to be a series of names and phone numbers. \u201cWe had one guy come in with a typed list,\u201d Singh recalls.But it\u2019s tough if your point of contact is a ,  or  account.\u201cSeveral provinces have attempted to do so and they haven\u2019t been able to get around some of the legal and privacy issues. \u2026 You don\u2019t know who has access to that person\u2019s profile.\u201d contacts people by social media when it has to, says Anthony Leonard, the agency\u2019s manager of .\u201cWhen individuals do not have contact information for former partners, our managers and staff may work through the online or social media applications mentioned in the case history,\u201d reads an emailed statement attributed to Leonard.The\xa0ease of anonymity and online identity fluidity pose problems, however.\u201cIndividuals may forget screen names of past partners or they may be only geo-locational. For example, you hook up with a person today on an online hook-up site that\u2019s close by, but they may not be in your area again and therefore it\u2019s difficult to find them on the site if they did not know the profile name, or there are limited online photos,\u201d he wrote. says public health officials are allowed to\xa0communicate with people via social media \u201cwhere it is the only method of communication available,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.\u201cHowever, public health officials generally must not disclose identifying information unless it is necessary to do so. It may be the case, in these circumstances, that public health officials are not disclosing any identifying health information when contacting people who may have been exposed to communicable diseases.\u201dScott Sibbald, spokesperson for , says it isn\u2019t something the office has dealt with.But\xa0there are questions that come up in dealing with personal health information and online platforms.\u201cDespite the convenience, use of social media to collect, use or disclose personal or health information raises issues concerning security of confidential personal or health information, as well as the accuracy of the information,\u201d he wrote in an email.\u201cWhat controls are in place to protect the information collected, used or disclosed on social media?

Those are just a couple of the questions that would need to be asked.\u201dBut even if it\u2019s kosher under Canadian privacy laws,  won\u2019t give health officials that data.The internet and the applications it\u2019s spawned don\u2019t make people more inclined toward casual sex, says University of Toronto epidemiologist Dionne Gesink.\u201cIt makes it easier and faster to find partners,\u201d she said.\u201cIt makes the sexual network more complicated: It creates more ties in the sexual network, which means things can spread.\u201dThat\u2019s what Gesink is setting out to explore now. She and her colleagues at Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health are embarking on an in-depth study to map Toronto\u2019s \u201csexual networks\u201d \u2014 specifically among men who have sex with men.They\u2019re looking for interviewees, so if you want to talk to them about the way you seek partners and your sex practices, give them a shout: .', u'Retired police officers warn Quebec against starting costly gun registryMONTREAL \u2013 Retired Montreal police officer Marc Brisebois remembers always being grateful for any gun-related information that popped up on his screen whenever he was on patrol and called to a house.\u201cIf you have that in front of you, you can take a decision more quickly,\u201d said Brisebois, who retired in 2006 after 30 years on the force.\u201cWe were happy to have that info.\u201dTwenty-one years after the introduction of the federal long-gun registry \u2013 since abolished by the Conservatives \u2013 Quebec is making progress on creating its own database of non-restricted firearms.While Brisebois\u2019 comments reflect the official line from police forces and unions across the country \u2013 especially in Quebec \u2013 not all rank-and file officers agree with him.Some retired cops from across the country are warning Quebec against setting up a registry they say isn\u2019t worth the money and just serves to make citizens feel safer.John, who didn\u2019t want to use his last name, retired from the Montreal police in 2007 after more than 30 years service, many of them spent patrolling downtown.He said it \u201cboggles the mind\u201d that so many millions were spent on the federal registry \u2013 with what he called so few results.When the introduced the registry in 1995, they said it would cost roughly $110 million to create.Instead, the figure ballooned to hundreds of millions of dollars before the Conservatives abolished it in 2012.Quebec said setting up its proper registry will cost $17 million and another $5 million, annually, to maintain.The controversial plan has fuelled reports of dissent within all major parties on the issue.John said smart officers never relied on gun data when answering calls because even if they were told a suspect had no registered firearms, \u201cyou still didn\u2019t know if anyone in that home has a gun.\u201d\u201cIf (the screen) says there is no gun registered to anyone in the house are you going to put your hand in your pocket and your mind on neutral?\u201d he asked rhetorically.Quebec\u2019s police leaders and union bosses argue the registry is essential because officers checked the old database hundreds of times a day.Critics, however, said that while everyone wants safe streets and less violence, there is little evidence a registry makes cities safer.They also argue the millions dedicated to maintaining a gun database can be used more efficiently on crime prevention or increased access to mental-health services.The Ontario Superior Court ruled in 2014 against a constitutional challenge to the Conservative law abolishing the registry, saying \u201cthere is no reliable evidence\u201d the decision \u201cactually has, or will, increase the incidence of violence or death by firearms.\u201dHomicide rates in Canada have been decreasing for years and have fallen in Quebec since the registry was abolished in 2012.A retired officer who worked in Vancouver\u2019s police department for 28 years told The Canadian Press he would \u201cnever rely on the federal government to tell me if there were guns in a house.\u201d\u201cThat is useless information because guns move,\u201d he said.He added that when the registry came online in the 1990s, \u201cit had absolutely no effect on the street and I think you\u2019ll find that most policemen will tell you that if they ran a house address and the operator came back and said there are no guns \u2013 they would take that as a total waste of air.\u201dThe Vancouver officer said police bosses and unions support the registry for political reasons.\u201cA lot of decisions that come down the pipe in police departments are a result of police departments getting funding from politicians,\u201d he said.But Brisebois believes the registry is more than just a tool for law enforcement \u2013 that it\u2019s a symbol of how a society treats firearms and that it reinforces Canada\u2019s cultural differences from those of the United States.\u201cSeeing what the registry did for me \u2013 spend the money,\u201d Brisebois said.\u201cThe important thing is to show people you are doing something [about guns.]\xa0The American way is that guns represent liberty and rights \u2013 do we want this? I don\u2019t. So am I ready to spend that money? Yes.\u201d', u'Telecommuting is growing as companies save money, answer to employee needsMONTREAL \u2013 Like many Canadians, Carla Holub has gladly given up commuting for the ease and comfort of working from home.The 41-year-old WestJet sales agent says she has no regrets since she made the change three years ago. Telecommuting affords her the time to take her children to dance lessons and hockey while reducing her lunch, coffee, gas and car insurance costs, she says.\u201cIt\u2019s been a great switch,\u201d she said from Calgary. \u201cIt just freed up a good two hours of my personal time being able to work from my home office.\u201dWestJet Airlines plans to establish a bilingual call centre in Moncton, N.B., but most of the 400 agents will work from home. They will join about 85 per cent of the airline\u2019s 900 call centre workers in Calgary who since 2013 have shifted to fielding customer calls remotely.The move has saved WestJet the cost of expanding its office to accommodate its growing staff, though that is partially offset by expenses to buy extra computers for employees so that they can work from home.Spokesman Robert Palmer said the transition was mainly designed to respond to workers who desire a better work-life balance.\u201cFrom an employer\u2019s perspective, generally speaking it makes for a happier employee and a happier employee is generally more productive,\u201d he said.The shift to telecommuting has accelerated since the 1990s growth of technology, said Sheryl Boswell, director of marketing for job website Monster Canada.She said most companies that allow employees to work from home are looking to build their businesses without added office expenses. They are also seeking access to a broader talent pool, she said.\u201cI think more employers are doing it because this is what seekers today demand,\u201d said Boswell, who herself telecommutes two days a week.More than 1.7 million paid employees \u2013 those not self-employed \u2013 worked from home in 2008 at least once a week, up almost 23 per cent from the 1.4 million in 2000, according to the latest Statistics Canada report on the subject in 2010.Despite the increase, the proportion of paid employees working from home grew by just one percentage point to 11.2 per cent during the period. A faster pace of growth among self-employed pushed the total proportion of people working from home up two percentage points to 19 per cent in 2008.Louise Howard is typical of those many self-employed home workers. The mother of children aged six and eight spends a few hours a day sewing clothing and accessories for children from her dining room that she sells online and to neighbourhood stores.\u201cIt\u2019s more a hobby that\u2019s become a business by accident,\u201d said the Montrealer, who says she makes about minimum wage for an average of three hours per day.Monster Canada says nearly 5,000 home-based employment positions are currently listed on its website, up 18 per cent from last year. Available positions vary from customer service and sales representatives to tech support, finance and real estate services. The growth of social media has also pushed companies to hire writers to create content.Telecommuting can also appeal to older workers, allowing businesses to adapt to changing demographics.\u201cIt\u2019s a weapon in a company\u2019s arsenal to attract great employees,\u201d said Robert Campbell, president of trade association ContactNB.About 30 per cent of New Brunswick\u2019s more than 100 call centres allow some form of telecommuting, Campbell said, adding that the workers have a range of jobs that include medical telecare, grief counselling, funeral planning and financial advice.', u'Late season additions paying off for Red Deer RebelsRED DEER, Alta. \u2013 The Red Deer Rebels sold off parts of the future in an attempt to win the 2016 Memorial Cup as the host team. It paid off on Sunday.Adam Helewka scored twice and Jake DeBrusk added a goal and two assists as the host Rebels beat the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies 5-2.Helewka, 20, and 19-year-old DeBrusk were added near the WHL trade deadline along with Luke Philp, also 19. The trio of veterans cost Red Deer six roster players and six draft picks over the next two years, including a first-rounder in 2017.\u201cWe know why we were brought here and this was a moment we had to be different makers,\u201d said Helewka, who scored 26 goals in 34 games for the Rebels after being acquired from the Spokane Chiefs.Philp had a single assist, but also won 21-of-31 faceoffs.The victory keeps Red Deer\u2019s tournament hopes very much alive after losing its opener to the OHL champion London Knights. Another loss would have left the Rebels in a do-or-die situation in their final round-robin game of the tournament against the WHL champion Brandon Wheat Kings.Evan Polei and Haydn Fleury also scored for the Rebels (1-1), while Rylan Toth made 22 saves.Timo Meier and Julien Nantel struck for the Huskies (1-1), who got a 33-save outing from Chase Marchand.Red Deer\u2019s Nelson Nogier, a 2014 Winnipeg Jets draft pick, took a cross-checking penalty 3:26 into the first period that led to the game\u2019s opening goal. Meier was able to beat Toth from just inside the right face-off circle for his third goal of the tournament 51 seconds into the power play.It didn\u2019t take very long for the Huskies to double their lead as Nantel broke into the zone down the left side and snapped the puck through Toth\u2019s legs at the eight-minute mark.Rebels coach Brent Sutter called a timeout right after the goal to try and reset, and it seemed to spark his team.\u201cBrent made a couple comments that really made us change our game,\u201d said Helewka, a 2015 San Jose Sharks draft pick. \u201cHe told us to just simplify. We know (the Huskies) are a fast team so we tried to play in their zone and limit the turnovers, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201dPolei got one back for the Rebels at 11:07 with a clean wrist shot between Marchand\u2019s pads to make it 2-1, bringing the sold-out crowd of 7,000 at Enmax Centrium to their feet for the first time since opening faceoff.Red Deer outshot the No. 1 ranked team in the country 7-0 to end the first and kept up the pressure early in the second, tying the game just 40 seconds into the period. DeBrusk made a pretty feed out front of the net to Helewka, who beat Marchand blocker side.Four minutes later, while on the power play, Ivan Nikolishin put a point shot on net that DeBrusk tipped past Marchand for a 3-2 lead.\u201cAs soon as we got the lead the crowd went nuts and we just kept saying score more, score more,\u201d said DeBrusk, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 draft by the Boston Bruins.A goaltender interference penalty called on Rouyn-Noranda\u2019s Anthony-John Greer led to Red Deer going up 4-2 with 11:09 to play in the second. DeBrusk, once again, found Helewka for his second of the game and third of the tournament.At that point the Rebels were in full control and had a 19-4 shot advantage since finding their legs on Polei\u2019s opening marker.Greer picked up two and 10 for unsportsmanlike conduct midway through the third after arguing with the officials about an embellishment call. It left him unable to finish the game.\u201cI overreacted, I saw it a different way than the refs did (but) I learn from my mistakes,\u201d said the Colorado Avalanche prospect.Fleury added a late power-play goal to help earn Red Deer its first win at the tournament.Notes: Only one host team in the past eight tournaments has gone on to win the Memorial Cup, the 2012 Shawinigan Cataractes\u2026 The London Knights (1-0) will play the Brandon Wheat Kings (0-1) on Monday.', u'Liberals take aim at airplane-bound lasersOTTAWA \u2013 The federal government is set to launch a social media campaign to shine a light on the ongoing problem of people pointing lasers at planes.Transport Minister Marc Garneau is expected to unveil the details of the campaign on Tuesday in Toronto as the government tries to address what is fast becoming a serious danger for pilots and air travellers.The number of laser incidents reported to Transport Canada has increased in the last few years: In 2014, there 502 so-called laser strike incidents on planes, a 43 per cent increase since 2012.In 2015, there 600 incidents. And through to April of this year, there have been 148 incidents.The concern is that one of those laser strikes distracts a pilot too much or affects their vision enough to jeopardize the safety of passengers and people on the ground.The punishments for anyone caught are steep: A fine of up to $100,000, five years in prison, or both.However, briefing materials for former transport minister Lisa Raitt, obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act, indicate that prosecuting offenders has proven difficult.\u201cWhile some stakeholders have suggested further legislative changes regarding directed light source\u2026there is ample legislative and regulatory deterrents,\u201d the briefing note reads.\u201cAny changes to existing behaviours and reduction in incidents will need to be supported through awareness and outreach.\u201dThat\u2019s why one year ago the previous Conservative government launched the \u201cnot a bright idea\u201d campaign and website to try and curb the number of laser incidents on planes. The campaign targeted Canadians around the country\u2019s three largest airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.The campaign Garneau is set to launch Tuesday will focus on social media instead of the traditional political ad campaigns of the past, but will continue to focus on areas near major airports.', u'To pay or not to pay: What is the tourist etiquette when posing for a picture?MONTREAL \u2013 When Montreal folk singer Jason Deeh Pitre performs for tourists in front of the stately Notre-Dame Basilica, he doesn\u2019t solicit money if someone asks him to be in on a souvenir snapshot.Three-quarters of the time, something gets thrown into his guitar case anyway.\u201cI\u2019m an artist,\u201d Deeh Pitre said in an interview. \u201dI\u2019m not a homeless person. It\u2019s a show, so if you like it, throw something in, and if you don\u2019t, well, sorry. So I don\u2019t ask, I just sing.\u201dHis comments are just one take on what the proper etiquette should be with regard to the interaction between street performers and tourists following a recent altercation in New York City.Jermaine Himmelstein was arrested for allegedly socking a Canadian tourist when she refused to tip him after a hug and a photo.Fred and Janette Howse, who were visiting Montreal from their native Wales, agreed the alleged punch was completely inappropriate but she said a fee should have been expected \u2014 especially in New York City.A better alternative, they added, would be to have asked for the money before the photo was taken.Carlos Silva, who has been performing in the square with his band for more than 10 years, said that while Himmelstein may have had no other source of income, violence is never an option.While his band members often have photos taken with tourists, they never ask for money in exchange, he added.\u201cIt\u2019s really CD sales that support us,\u201d said Silva, adding it contravenes city rules for performers to ask for cash.Breanne McLeavy, a Vancouverite who was also visiting Montreal, said tourists will want to pay street performers who are good at what they do.\u201dIf you said upfront this is going to cost you $1 and then you don\u2019t pay, then that\u2019s a different story\u2026But if they don\u2019t want to pay you that\u2019s their discretion. You\u2019re out in the public, and I think it\u2019s their right to pay you a lot, or a little, or (nothing).\u201d', u'Action Plan sign removal not feds\u2019 job: OttawaOTTAWA \u2013 Thousands of old \u201cEconomic Action Plan\u201d signs dotting the Canadian landscape are not captured by a new federal advertising crackdown and will remain in place until whenever individual funding recipients get around to taking them down.The Liberals introduced new federal policies this month designed to lift the taint of partisanship from publicly funded ads \u2014 a direct reaction, they said, to the former Conservative government\u2019s behaviour.But clearing away the last vestiges of the Conservatives\u2019 whole-of-government, Economic Action Plan branding exercise is not Ottawa\u2019s responsibility, the Privy Council Office told The Canadian Press.\u201cPlease note that project signage for funded projects is not considered advertising,\u201d PCO spokesman Raymond Rivet said in response to questions about the new ad policy and the old signs.\u201cAdvertising consists of things like paid billboards and transit posters. Removal and disposal of signage is done by the organization leading the project\u2026. Thus, any signage removal was/is undertaken by the funded organization in accordance with the contribution agreements.\u201dMoreover, the new policy came into effect May 11 and does not apply to \u201ccommunication products\u201d placed by previous governments.When he announced the new rules at a May 12 news conference, Treasury Board President Scott Brison repeatedly stated \u201cthe policy applies to all government advertising and communication.\u201dAnd while he didn\u2019t cite the Economic Action Plan by name, the Liberal minister justified the \u201cstrong policy response\u201d by stating the \u201cprevious government, we believe, crossed the line repeatedly in terms of advertising and communication and in a way that was abusive of taxpayers interests and of democratic values.\u201dThe new policy, he said, covers political party slogans, images or any kind of party affiliation.Tens of millions of dollars were spent over the years advertising the Economic Action Plan, which was simply a slogan and marketing device for the Conservatives\u2019 massive, recession-fighting deficit budget of 2009 but continued uninterrupted through their final 2015 budget. Signs were still going up on new federally funded projects last August during the general election campaign.The EAP, as it was known, even had its own internal government \u201cStyle Guide: Project Signage\u201d that was explicit about signs being an integral part of \u201cmaintaining the integrity of the brand \u2026 for all communications products and activities including announcements, releases, advertising, marketing materials, web sites, backdrops and signage.\u201dSuch unique branding is forbidden under the new policy, said PCO\u2019s Rivet, but it doesn\u2019t mean the end of placards heralding federally funded projects.\u201cProject signs are allowed if they use the official symbols correctly and adhere to the other requirements of the new policy, including the new definition of non-partisan,\u201d said PCO, the central bureaucracy that serves cabinet and the prime minister.As for the remaining EAP signs out there, PCO says it doesn\u2019t centrally track the number \u2014 although at one point in 2010, 18 different federal departments and agencies were tracking sign placements and making mandatory weekly reports, which then found their way into memorandums for prime minister Stephen Harper. As of Jan. 1, 2015, there were 22,235 \u201cactive projects in the system,\u201d said Rivet.\u201cThis does not translate directly to the number of signs that could still be present, as some of these initiatives have since been completed; however this is the latest data available prior to the program ending.\u201dThose active projects don\u2019t include thousands of older projects long since completed. All are dependent on the local project manager for removal of signage.At least some EAP funding agreements dictated that a sign had to be erected before the infrastructure would be deemed completed, with 20 per cent of funding held back until proof the distinctive sign was up.\u2014 Follow @BCheadle on Twitter', u'Trudeau arrives in Japan for G7 summitTOKYO \u2013 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has landed in Tokyo where he will hold a bilateral visit with Japanese leaders before attending the Group of Seven summit later this week.The prime minister touched down early Monday evening local time, accompanied by his wife Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau.Trudeau is expected to\xa0meet Tuesday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the emperor and empress of Japan as well as automotive sector officials.The visit comes ahead of the G7 summit on Thursday and Friday in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.This is Trudeau\u2019s first overseas bilateral visit to Asia since taking office.\xa0He plans to discuss trade, investment, security, education and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xa0', u'Over 400 Syrian refugees gathered in Toronto to celebrate their arrival to CanadaThe Friends of Syria Group arranged for six busloads of Syrian refugees to be brought to the Port Lands in Toronto to welcome them to Canada and help them make new friends during this exciting but difficult transition.The day was filled with activities for kids, food, and singing of the Canadian National Anthem. Volunteers spent days collecting new and used clothing, food, bedding sets, and furniture to give to the families in need.For many, this was the first time newcomers met other Syrian refugees since they arrived in Canada.Syrian Refugee, Manal Alomour, has been living in Canada for four\xa0months with her family of seven.

They also found a broken zipper on her harness.Boaters pulled her body from the Snake River, attempted CPR and met up with emergency responders.Czyz was pronounced dead at the Centennial Waterfront Park docks.Twin Falls County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Lori Stewart said investigators determined the death was an accident.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Lack of passport keeps Newfoundland woman from son\u2019s wedding in JamaicaFirst the fire destroyed Kimberly Parson\u2019s home in Fort McMurray, Alta. and then she had to flee from an oilsands site where she worked, but the topper for the Newfoundland woman is that she can\u2019t attend her eldest son\u2019s wedding in Jamaica without her passport.The passport was one of the few belongings she had  earlier this month.Parsons says after that, she had to return to work with a company that supplies coveralls for the oil industry and she left the passport in a room in the Noralta Bighorn Lodge work camp.When the fire got too close and the site where she was working was evacuated, no one was allowed to return to the camp.Evacuation orders , but Parsons is now staying with her brother in Grande Cache and can\u2019t get back to the camp for her passport.Parsons says she\u2019s already cancelled her ticket for Jamaica anyway, and will have to make do with pictures of the wedding, which is scheduled for Tuesday in Montego Bay.\u201cWe\u2019re all supposed to be in Jamaica but it\u2019s not working out like that,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cIt\u2019s just got me killed that I can\u2019t be there.\u201dHer younger son, who owned the home where she lived in Fort McMurray, also cancelled his ticket and is staying with her in Grande Cache.The family, which hails from Wesleyville, NL, talked about postponing the wedding due to the stress of that everyone is under, but Parsons said she thought the ceremony should go ahead.Her older son\u2019s home in downtown Fort McMurray was spared, but he and his fiancee spent over $7,000 dollars in reservations to fly to Jamaica with their two sons.Parsons is upset she and other workers got called back to work so soon after the Fort McMurray evacuation and while the area was still in danger.

Patients can ask for it, doctors and nurses can provide it.But without a federal law in place, the only guidance available on the procedure would come from the Supreme Court decision itself. And it\u2019s far from clear, Blackmer told the West Block\u2019s Tom Clark.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe  also contains no outline for the\xa0process that a doctor would follow in terms of determining whether or not someone would qualify, and there\u2019s no reporting requirement. A medical professional could technically help end a patient\u2019s life, then\xa0tell no one.\u201cSo you can imagine for the average physician being faced with this type of a scenario, they will not want to participate because they will not feel at all comfortable in terms of the legal status of their activities or the extent to which they will be protected legally as well,\u201d Blackmer said.Even with a law in place, access to assisted death may be tricky. Only 29 per cent of doctors surveyed by the Canadian Medical Association said they were comfortable with helping someone\xa0die if that patient is terminally ill. For someone who isn\u2019t terminal, the percentage of doctors willing to participate drops to 19 per cent.\u201cI anticipate that if we were talking about things like someone whose sole diagnosis is mental illness that would go down further,\u201d Blackmer said.', u'Assisted-death deadline looms in the SenateFifteen\xa0days.That\u2019s how long the government of Canada now has to legislate medically-assisted dying before seeking medical help to end your life is no longer illegal in Canada.The House of Commons still hasn\u2019t voted on the bill, a situation that\xa0has some senators very nervous. By the time they get their hands on it (probably on May 31), there won\u2019t be enough time to examine it properly, amend it, and get it back to the House, according to Conservative Sen. Don Plett.He estimated that the Senate would have a little over 48 hours to do its work in order to meet\xa0the June 6 deadline set by the Supreme Court of Canada.\u201cTo rush that through in two days would clearly not be what the chamber of sober second thought should be doing.\u201d\xa0Senator Peter Harder, the government\u2019s representative in the Senate, has been\xa0tasked with shepherding the bill through the Senate. He told Clark that he won\u2019t intervene with any procedural tricks to move things along faster in the upper chamber.\u201cI\u2019ve had very constructive conversations with the leadership of the Senate and we\u2019re looking at how we can map out a deliberative and productive pacing to the Senate work.\u201d\xa0Harder explained that the Senate is already considering a motion to extend its sitting hours to midnight to allow for more debate and a quicker resolution. There may be amendments to the bill before it heads back to the House for a final vote.', u'#LeFlop and #Elbowgate: Sports and politics intersect on the internetToronto Raptors fans took to Twitter during Game 3 of the final against the Cleveland Cavaliers to mock LeBron James, who was knocked down during an altercation in the middle of the game.The Raptors went The commotion started in the second quarter, when Toronto\u2019s Bismack Biyombo was upset about not getting a foul call after a hit.Other players joined in, but it ended when the Cavs\u2019 Tristan Thompson\u2019s elbow came up and hit James in the face, sending him to the ground.Fans called foul on the fall, saying James was overreacting.But they were quick to point out a comparison: the basketball court looked a lot like the House of Commons this week.#Elbowgate started trending Wednesday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau physically pulled the Conservative whip through the House, elbowing NDP MP Ruth-Ellen Brosseau.', u'Justin Trudeau heads to Japan to talk trade, investmentsJustin Trudeau makes his first major push into Asia this week in Japan, where he hopes to broaden business links with a country that was once Canada\u2019s No. 2 trading partner.The prime minister will depart Sunday for his first overseas bilateral visit since taking office last fall.He will meet early in the week in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the emperor and empress as well as leaders in the automotive sector.The visit comes ahead of Trudeau\u2019s participation in the Group of Seven summit, on Thursday and Friday, in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.But before Trudeau sits down with the powerful group of world leaders, he will try to reinvigorate Canada\u2019s trade and investment relationship with Japan.His office says it believes there is still a lot of fertile ground in Japan and sees it as a key player in a region where the Liberal government intends to expand economic ties.One of the main goals of Trudeau\u2019s visit will be to try to encourage Japanese auto industry officials to invest more and to keep the plants already in Canada.In his meeting with Abe, Trudeau\u2019s office said he plans to discuss negotiations on the countries\u2019 economic partnership agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, security co-operation, education and the Arctic, given Japan\u2019s relative proximity.The Japanese-Canadian relationship has been a smooth one, but there are still several ways it could be improved.For starters, Japan\u2019s ambassador in Ottawa notes that fewer than 15 years ago, his country was Canada\u2019s No. 2 trading partner after the United States.But Kenjiro Monji says Japan\u2019s trade position with Canada has slipped since 2002.In 2009, he said Japan had tumbled to No. 5 after being passed by China, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The value of trade between Japan and British Columbia fell by 45 per cent between 2000 and 2014, Monji added.The slide, he said, is due to nearly two decades of recession in Japan, China\u2019s economic boom and the emergence of Canadian trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.Monji believes the bilateral trade could get a boost from a key Canadian energy source that Japan needs: liquefied natural gas.Japan, the world\u2019s biggest buyer of LNG, is hoping Canada will issue necessary environmental permits to allow companies to export it from British Columbia.B.C. Premier Christy Clark recently told The Canadian Press it\u2019s time to proceed given the approval process started more than three years ago.\u201cCanada is one of the most-promising potential exporters to Japan because \u2026 liquefied natural gas occupies a still very important share in our energy policy,\u201d said Monji, who noted that Japanese companies are involved in several LNG projects in Canada.Japan is also expected to tout the benefits for Canada of the , a huge, 12-country treaty that would deepen trade connections across the Asia-Pacific region.The pact, which Canada is reviewing, includes the major economies of Japan and the United States.The controversial, yet-to-be-ratified TPP, negotiated by the former Conservative government, has raised concerns in several Canadian industries.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe future of the TPP is in doubt. U.S. presidential hopefuls from both the Democrats and Republicans have said they would reject the treaty.With the TPP still pending, Monji doesn\u2019t expect any movement on talks of a bilateral Canada-Japan trade deal.He did praise the Canda-Japan relationship and was quick to point out this will be Trudeau and Abe\u2019s third meeting in six months. They sat down together at the APEC summit in Manila and again in Washington for a nuclear safety talks.Japan is also expected to raise the issue of regional security with Canada, particularly the ongoing territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea.Masayuki Tadokoro, a Keio University law professor, said Japan will scrutinize Trudeau\u2019s words on the matter, even though Canada may not want to take very strong position due its economic interests in China.\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s very difficult for many Canadians and Europeans to understand, but for Japanese, China represents a real security threat.\u201dOverall, there are few entanglements between Canada and Japan, but they do have a trade relationship many believe has unrealized potential, says David Welch, CIGI chair of global security at the Balsillie School of International Affairs.Welch said it\u2019s partly due to the complexities of selling in Japan and the fact Canada has put more focus in recent years on trade with Latin America and Europe.\u201cNow, the Japanese have huge hopes that Trudeau will bring Canada back. I hear this all the time, not just from Japan, but from other countries in the region, too.\u201d\xa0', u'A child can drown 24 hours after being in water: What parents should knowParents\xa0know to watch their\xa0children when they\u2019re  the water, but there are life-threatening signs to look for after they\u2019ve\xa0taken them  as well.\u201cA child could die 24 hours later after they have been in the water,\u201d said\xa0Barbara Byers of Canada\u2019s\xa0\u201cThe ones you have to keep an eye on,\u201d she added, are kids who go\xa0under, inhaling and coughing up water in the process.\u201cThis can happen in a bathtub as well if the child goes face down in the water.\u201dThat water can irritate the lungs, which may cause more fluid build-up. If too much liquid\xa0accumulates, the lungs may run out of room for air.It used to be called , and some people still call it that.

And \u201cit\u2019s becoming more common for teens and adults to be diagnosed with the illness.\u201dThe illness can cause inattention, hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour. For children it is seen as a barrier to doing well in school, but for adults, who tend to contain their hyperactivity, the effects can be devastating.He says it could even lead to someone losing their job.ADHD affects about four per cent adults; however, diagnosis\xa0is less likely as some health care providers have less training in recognizing it in adults.He believes that\u2019s due to a general underservicing of mental health needs in Canada \u2013 an area which has seen lots of development as many initiatives have been trying to raise awareness in recent years.CADDRA is currently working to help physicians and the general public become more knowledgeable about adult ADHD, Almagor told Global News.Those with ADHD often treat their symptoms with\xa0counselling,\xa0medication, and forms of self-care such using notes, keeping a consistent schedule, and getting enough sleep.Almagor said if you think you could be affected, you should contact your family doctor.', u'New research raises questions about Liberal plans to change parental leaveOTTAWA \u2013 New research shows Canada\u2019s parental leave program leaves out two-fifths of mothers, many of them low-income, and points to a stark divide between families that are \u201cparental-leave-rich\u201d and \u201cparental-leave-poor\u201d \u2013 just as the Liberals prepare to enhance the program.A study of federal parental leave figures published this week finds that about 41 per cent of mothers outside of Quebec don\u2019t qualify for benefits because they don\u2019t have enough insurable hours.In Quebec, which has its own maternity and paternity leave program, less than 11 per cent didn\u2019t qualify.Those numbers don\u2019t include mothers in Canada\u2019s three territories or in First Nations communities, which means the number of mothers who don\u2019t qualify could be even higher.There was also an economic divide: More than 65 per cent of women earning over $30,000 qualified for the benefit in 2013, while that number was about 37 per cent for women earning under that amount.The results of the study, published Thursday in the Journal of Industrial Relations, raises questions about the Liberal plan for a revamped parental leave program, and whether the party\u2019s promise to extend leave to 18 months will just exacerbate the situation.During the election, the Liberals promised to allow new parents to take up to 18 months of leave after a child is born and also give parents the option of spreading 12 months of benefits into chunks over the extended time period.Labour Minister MaryAnn Mihychuk has also said she is interested in creating dedicated leave for new fathers, similar to what is in place in Quebec, and will put the idea to Canadians in yet-to-be-launched consultations.The lead author on the study said the government has already been warned that its plan could leave out almost half the children in the country unless it eases eligibility rules so more mothers, especially low-income earners, can qualify.\u201cYou\u2019re going in a direction of making yourself look good by doing something for middle-class parents, but you\u2019re not addressing what is the actual problem with parental leave,\u201d said Lindsey McKay, a post-doctoral fellow and adjunct professor at Brock University\u2019s school of sociology.For now, the federal parental leave program pays out benefits for up to 15 weeks for new mothers and allows mothers and fathers to split an additional 35 weeks.The federal program requires parents to have worked at least 600 hours in the year before they go on leave, unlike in Quebec where the threshold is $2,000 of earnings. That difference has meant that Quebec over time has seen an increase in the number of low-income women qualifying for the benefit \u2013 boosting national numbers to give a rosier picture of parental leave in Canada.The 600-hour requirement in the rest of Canada has had the opposite effect as fewer women over time have qualified for leave. The percentage of women not qualifying has gone up since the mid-1990s when the hours required stood at 300. Even though in some cases they have contributed to employment insurance for years, they may not have enough hours to qualify because they work part-time, or they are students.Changing those requirements to be in line with Quebec\u2019s standard would allow more mothers to stay at home during the first year of their child\u2019s life, McKay said.\u201cThe children are kind of penalized for the employment situation of the parent at the time of their birth,\u201d said McKay, who herself didn\u2019t qualify for the benefit four years ago after giving birth to twins because she was a student.\u201cWhat it means is that we have a vast majority of people contributing to the program, but the people who are benefiting are those who are in higher income households.\u201d']

[u'Where Obama and his family will live after they leave the White HouseWASHINGTON \u2013 Real estate circles are buzzing over reports that President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have decided to lease a nine-bedroom mansion in one of Washington\u2019s poshest neighbourhoods when he leaves office in January.With a sprawling terrace and a castle-like exterior, the home sits on a quarter-acre lot just down the road from the Naval Observatory, the vice-president\u2019s official residence, in the wealthy Kalorama neighbourhood near Embassy Row. A 2011 remodel brought the total number of bathrooms to eight-and-a-half, along with three fireplaces and an \u201cau pair suite,\u201d spread out over roughly 8,200 square feet, according to real estate data. It features parking for up to 10 cars.Peg Mancuso, the president of the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors, called the area \u201cclearly one of the best neighbourhoods in the Washington Metropolitan area.\u201d She said if the reports are true, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have picked a better neighbourhood for his family.\u201d\u201cIt seemed like the perfect choice,\u201d Manusco said.The mansion\u2019s owners, President Bill Clinton\u2019s former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart and his wife, live in New York, where he works for the NFL. The White House declined to comment on the possibility of the Obamas renting the property, first reported by .An individual familiar with the Obamas\u2019 plans said they had started their housing search and were currently looking at rental properties in a number of Washington neighbourhoods, including Kalorama. The individual wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the issue publicly and requested anonymity.It was unclear whether the Obamas had settled on the Kalorama property and formally leased it or whether they were still considering other options. Obama\u2019s aides and friends have been reluctant to discuss his plans in light of the intense security preparations the U.S. Secret Service must undertake to ensure the first family can be adequately protected while living in a private home.Obama has said publicly that he and his family plan to stay in Washington after leaving the White House until their youngest daughter, 14-year-old Sasha Obama, graduates from high school. Sasha\u2019s older sister, Malia Obama, graduates from high school this year and .\u201cTransferring someone in the middle of high school \u2014 tough,\u201d Obama said earlier this year in Milwaukee.Built in the 1920s, the mansion last sold in 2013 for about $5.3 million \u2014 a drop from the list price of about $6 million, according to real estate records. It was put on the market in 2012 for just under $8 million but later removed.For years, Obama has complained publicly about the lack of privacy that comes with life in the White House, and has said he\u2019s eagerly awaiting the day he can recapture some of the anonymity and freedom of movement he enjoyed before becoming president. Though his decision to remain temporarily in Washington may delay that, Obama is expected to spend considerable time in the coming years in Chicago, where his family owns a home and where his presidential library will be built, as well as in New York and in Hawaii, where Obama was born.\xa0', u'Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders toss around possibility of debateWASHINGTON \u2013 Chances are likely slim, but what about a Donald Trump-Bernie Sanders debate heading into the crucial June 7 California primary?That possibility surfaced Wednesday, even if in a jocular tone, in an indirect exchange between the Republican billionaire real estate mogul and the senator who Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t been able to bump from the Democratic presidential sweepstakes.On ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d Trump said he enjoyed watching Clinton\u2019s increasingly heated sparring with Sanders.\xa0 \t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cI had no idea it was going to be so nasty,\u201d said Trump, who said he\u2019d be happy to engage Sanders in a one-on-one debate \u2014 as long as significant money goes to charity.Sanders said on Twitter he\u2019d welcome that. \u201cGame on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'Canadian singer The Weeknd cancels Jimmy Kimmel performance because of TrumpNEW YORK \u2013 Canadian R&B singer  and rapper Belly have cancelled their performance on because Donald Trump was set to appear on the episode.The Oscar-nominated musicians were slated to record their performance Wednesday in Los Angeles for the late-night ABC show. Belly said he cancelled because he didn\u2019t want to share a stage with Trump and disagrees with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s views and beliefs.Trump has been criticized by some political rivals and voters for his comments on topics including women, refugees, immigrants and Muslims, such as when he said some Mexican immigrants in the U.S. illegally are \u201crapists\u201d and when he called for a ban on Muslim immigration into the United States.A Trump spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on The Weeknd and Belly.The Jimmy Kimmel show had no comment, a representative said. Representatives for The Weeknd didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.The Weeknd won two Grammy Awards earlier this year, including best urban contemporary album for \u201cBeauty Behind the Madness.\u201d Belly has co-written many of The Weeknd\u2019s hits, including \u201cEarned It,\u201d \u201dThe Hills,\u201d \u201dInto the Night\u201d and \u201cOften.\u201dThe Weeknd appears on Belly\u2019s song \u201cMight Not,\u201d which they were set to perform on Kimmel\u2019s show.Belly, who\u2019s signed to Jay Z\u2019s Roc Nation management, will release a new mixtape, \u201cAnother Day In Paradise,\u201d on Friday.\u201cI\u2019m here on a campaign of positivity and love and to contribute what I can to music,\u201d Belly said. \u201cI create songs people go to sleep and wake up to, songs that they fall in love to. For me, being Muslim and being somebody that appreciates my access here in America, I love the fact that I\u2019m able to be here. To play my part in this business is a privilege and a beautiful thing. The fact that I could lose that ability through the actions of someone such as Donald Trump isn\u2019t right to me. At all.\u201dBelly shared an Oscar nomination for best original song with The Weeknd for \u201cEarned It,\u201d which appears on the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d soundtrack.Belly and The Weekend are from Canada. Belly also co-wrote Beyonce\u2019s \u201c6 Inch,\u201d which features vocals from The Weeknd and appears on her \u201cLemonade\u201d album.', u'Trump reaches magic number to clinch Republican nominationWASHINGTON \u2013  on Thursday reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination for president, completing an unlikely rise that has upended the political landscape and sets the stage for a bitter fall campaign.Trump was put over the top in the Associated Press delegate count by a small number of the party\u2019s unbound delegates who told the AP they would support him at the convention. Among them is Oklahoma GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard.It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president. Trump has reached 1,238. With 303 delegates at stake in five state primaries on June 7, Trump will easily pad his total, avoiding a contested convention in Cleveland in July.Trump, a political neophyte who for years delivered caustic commentary on the state of the nation from the sidelines but had never run for office, fought off 16 other Republican contenders in an often ugly primary race.Many on the right have been slow to warm to Trump, wary of his conservative bona fides. Others worry about Trump\u2019s crass personality and the lewd comments he\u2019s made about women.But millions of grassroots activists, many who have been outsiders to the political process, have embraced Trump as a plain-speaking populist who is not afraid to offend.Steve House, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party and an unbound delegate who confirmed his support of Trump to AP, said he likes the billionaire\u2019s background as a businessman.\u201cLeadership is leadership,\u201d House said. \u201cIf he can surround himself with the political talent, I think he will be fine.\u201dOthers who confirmed their decision to back Trump were more tepid, saying they are supporting him out of a sense of obligation because he won their state\u2019s primary.Cameron Linton of Pittsburgh said he will back Trump on the first ballot since he won the presidential primary vote in Linton\u2019s congressional district.\u201cIf there\u2019s a second ballot I won\u2019t vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Linton said. \u201cHe\u2019s ridiculous. There\u2019s no other way to say it.\u201dTrump\u2019s path to the Republican presidential nomination began with an escalator ride.Trump and his wife, Melania, descended an escalator into the basement lobby of the Trump Tower on June 16, 2015, for an announcement many observers said would never come: The celebrity real estate developer, who had flirted with running for office in the past, would announce that he was launching his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.That speech set the tone for the candidate\u2019s ability to dominate the headlines with provocative statements, insults and hyperbole. He called Mexicans \u201crapists,\u201d promised to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and ban Muslims from the U.S. for an indeterminate time.He put down women based on their looks. And he unleashed an uncanny marketing ability in which he deduced his critics\u2019 weak points and distilled those to nicknames that stuck. \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, \u201cWeak\u201d Jeb Bush and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz, among others, all were forced into primarily reacting to Trump. They fell one-by-one \u2014 leaving Trump sole survivor of a riotous Republican primary.His rallies became must-see events and magnets for free publicity. Onstage, he dispensed populism that drew thousands of supporters, many wearing his trademark \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and chanting, \u201cBuild the wall!\u201dThe events drew protests too\u2014 with demonstrators sometimes being forcibly ejected from the proceedings. One rally in Chicago was cancelled after thousands of demonstrators surrounded the venue and the Secret Service could no longer vouch for the candidate\u2019s safety.When voting started, Trump was not so fast out of the gate.He lost the Iowa caucuses in February, falling behind Cruz and barely edging Rubio for second. He recovered in New Hampshire. From there he and Cruz fiercely engaged, with Trump winning some and losing some but one way or another dominating the rest of the primary season \u2014 in votes or at least in attention \u2014 and ultimately in delegates.All the while, Republican leaders declared themselves appalled by Trump\u2019s rise. Conservatives called the onetime Democrat a fraud. But they failed, ultimately, to block him. Republican leaders slowly, warily, began meeting with Trump and his staff. And he began winning endorsements from a few members of Congress.As with other aspects of his campaign, Trump upended the traditional role of money in the race.He incurred relatively low campaign costs \u2014 just $57 million through the end of April. He covered most of it with at least $43 million of his own money loaned to the campaign. He spent less than $21 million on paid television and radio commercials. That\u2019s about one-quarter of what Jeb Bush and his allies spent on TV.

Civil\xa0Liberties Association, said it is true the so-called exemption\xa0opportunity ends as of June 6th, but she characterized\xa0Wilson-Raybould\u2019s statement as \u201ccompletely misleading.\u201dCritically-ill Canadians will have access to physician-assisted\xa0dying \u2013 even if there is no law passed by June 6 \u2013 because there\xa0will no longer be a need to seek a court exemption and the top\xa0court\u2019s ruling takes effect, Pastine noted.\xa0Physician-assisted dying will be regulated by the provincial and\xa0territorial health care laws as well as the standards of the medical\xa0profession, she added, noting patients will also be required to meet\xa0the criteria set out by the Supreme Court.NDP justice critic Murray Rankin, a public law expert, also sees\xa0Wilson-Raybould\u2019s remarks as off base.\xa0The minister is correct to suggest a federal law would promote\xa0more reliable access across Canada, but she is wrong to suggest only\xa0a federal law can provide it, Rankin noted.Rankin also pointed to the fact the Alberta Court of Appeal\xa0decision highlights how the concepts in the government\u2019s proposed\xa0legislation are more narrow than the Supreme Court\u2019s original\xa0ruling.Ubaka Ogbogu, an assistant law professor at the University of\xa0Alberta, stressed an absence of legislation will simply mean no one\xa0can be prosecuted as of June 6 for doing exactly what the Supreme\xa0Court ruled can be done.\u201cThere is no legal vacuum (as the government has suggested),\u201d\xa0he said. \u201cThe Supreme Court decision becomes the law and it will\xa0then fall to health care practioners, primarily, to decide, if and\xa0how they are going to implement that criteria.\u201dCarissima Mathen, a law professor at the University of Ottawa,\xa0said the minister\u2019s statement is confusing on its face but she\xa0senses Wilson-Raybould was referring to the procedures developed by\xa0the courts to evaluate whether the conditions outlined in the\xa0Supreme Court\u2019s decision are in fact satisfied.\u201cMy reading of what she was saying is even that level of\xa0scrutiny by the judiciary will cease to happen as of June 6 because\xa0\u2026 the courts are no longer authorized to consider exemptions.\u201dTrudo Lemmens, a law professor at the University of Toronto who\xa0specializes in health law and policy, said the minister\u2019s remarks\xa0are reasonable. Most physicians can and indeed should be reluctant to actively\xa0participate in life-ending actions in the absence of a legislativeframework, he noted.Lemmens also noted the Alberta court dealt with its\xa0interpretation of the original Supreme Court ruling, not with the\xa0constitutionality of the proposed legislation.Those who say that courts will reject the constitutionality of\xa0the bill, simply by looking at what the Alberta Court of Appeal\xa0ruled, are making premature statements, he said.Wilson-Raybould\u2019s claim that patients will no longer be able to\xa0go to a Superior Court judge to seek an exemption as of June 6 is\xa0confusing for a number of reasons. However, the minister is correct\xa0to note the exemption opportunity will cease to exist on this date.\xa0For these reasons, the minister\u2019s statement receives an\xa0assessment of \u201csome baloney.\u201dThe Baloney Meter is a project of The Canadian Press that\xa0examines the level of accuracy in statements made by politicians.\xa0Each claim is researched and assigned a rating based on the\xa0following scale:', u'World leaders right to be worried by rise of Donald Trump, Obama saysSHIMA, Japan \u2013 U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday that foreign leaders are \u201crattled\u201d by  and have good reason to feel that way, as he accused the presumptive Republican presidential nominee of ignorance about world affairs.Weighing in on the Democratic race to replace him, Obama also downplayed concerns that the protracted fight between  and  is hurting his party\u2019s chances, brushing off their escalating attacks as the inevitable \u201cgrumpiness\u201d of a primary campaign.Obama offered his assessment of the presidential campaign on the sidelines of a Group of Seven advanced economies summit in Japan, the latest world gathering to be colored by global concerns about Trump. Obama said foreign leaders at the conference were unsure how seriously to take his pronouncements.He contrasted that to proposals that thoughtfully address what\u2019s required to keep the U.S. safe and prosperous and \u201cto keep the world on an even keel.\u201dQuestions about the unpredictable Trump have increasingly trailed Obama when he travels overseas, with world leaders incredulously sizing up a leading presidential candidate who speaks of banning Muslim immigration, starting trade wars and spreading nuclear weapons to Japan and South Korea. Obama has said that Trump now comes up in every one of his foreign meetings, with the president offering reassurances that he doesn\u2019t believe Trump will be elected.Though Obama has generally avoided opining on the presidential race, particularly while the Democratic primary continues to play out, he\u2019s made no secret of his distaste for Trump, whose election would mark a sharp departure from Obama in both tone and substance. In addition to opposing the sweeping Asia-Pacific free trade deal that Obama brokered, Trump has threatened to renegotiate Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and the global climate pact reached in Paris.Obama, taking questions the day before he pays a historic visit to Hiroshima, said foreign countries pay more attention to U.S. elections than Americans do to theirs because they count on the U.S. to provide stability and direction in addressing global challenges.Obama\u2019s comments to reporters came amid growing Democratic impatience to see the party unite behind Clinton, who is close to netting the number of delegates needed for the nomination but has unable to persuade Sanders to exit the race. Many Democrats, including prominent senators, have started publicly voicing frustration with Sanders, who shows no signs of a quick departure despite near-impossible odds of overtaking Clinton.Rather, Sanders has warned of a potentially \u201cmessy\u201d Democratic Convention in Philadelphia in July, stoking concerns for the Democratic Party and for Clinton\u2019s campaign, both of which are eager to shift their focus to attacking Trump and courting voters needed to win the general election in November.Yet Obama brushed off calls for him to get more personally involved in brokering a resolution, saying that he\u2019s still inclined to let the Democratic primary play itself out. He likened the hard-fought campaign between Clinton and Sanders to the one he waged with Clinton in 2008.\u201cDuring primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other. Somebody\u2019s supporter pops off and there\u2019s a certain buildup of aggravation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cEvery little speed bump, conflict trash-talking that takes place is elevated.\u201dHe urged both Democratic candidates to \u201ctry to stick to the issues,\u201d adding that the grumpiness often stems from voters\u2019 frustration when the campaign instead becomes dominated by talk about \u201cpersonalities and character.\u201dAsked about the Taliban\u2019s new leader, Obama said he was not optimistic about a change for the better any time soon despite the U.S. drone strike that killed former Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour, who had refused to engage in reconciliation talks with Afghanistan\u2019s government.Mansour\u2019s replacement, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, has signalled intentions to continue Mansour\u2019s aggressive approach. But Obama said he never expected \u201ca liberal Democrat\u201d to be the newly appointed leader of the Taliban.\u201cIn the short term, we anticipate the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence,\u201d Obama said. He added that he was hopeful that eventually \u201cwhen there are those within the community that surround the Taliban that recognize their goals are best achieved by negotiations.\u201d', u'Young Conservatives bucking for bigger role as party bids farewell to HarperOTTAWA \u2013 As Conservative leader  prepped for the federal leaders debates during last fall\u2019s election, someone needed to be chosen to play the role of his chief opponent, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.Conservatives were keenly aware the debates might be the best chance for Harper to show up a man the Conservatives dismissed as a young pup incapable of leading the country.But they also didn\u2019t want their leader, 57, to come off as an old dog \u2014 a tension that still ripples through the party as they head into their first post-election convention and attempt to rebuild public support.To give Harper a chance to practice debating with someone many years his junior, Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre took a turn playing Trudeau\u2019s part.Poilievre was only 25 when first elected in 2004, one of many Conservatives who took a seat in the House of Commons while still in their twenties and who are still in those seats today. There are currently 18 Conservative MPs younger than the current prime minister, who is 44.So it\u2019s frustrating to many young Conservatives that people think about Trudeau first when it comes to who can appeal to young voters, said Justin Burton, who first joined the Conservatives when he was 18.Now 30, Burton has started a think tank called Future Leaders of the CPC to connect young Tories to the current MPs. Up until a year before the fall election, he would rarely get his calls to MPs returned.Then came a deluge as the party realized the youth vote was going to be a key component of the campaign as the Tories prepared to battle the Liberals.The party needs to start reaching young voters far sooner, Burton said, including people who might not be eligible to vote today but will be in 2019. To do so requires a mix of a far more savvy communications strategy, a strong leader and a refresh of party policy, he said.But if that\u2019s what young people want, they need to take responsibility too, said Natalie Pon, 24, who sits on the executive of the Edmonton West riding association.Pon said she got involved in her electoral district association on her own and has received nothing but support from the start, not just from her local MP but also party officials.She is one of the co-sponsors of what could be one of the hottest debates at this weekend\u2019s Conservative party convention \u2014 the issue of deleting references in existing party policy that oppose same sex marriage.She brought it forward because she wanted a contemporary policy that reflected the actual laws of Canada, she said.Two pieces of legislation currently in the works from the Liberal government have their roots in policies brought forward by young Liberals at their convention \u2014 assisted suicide and the decriminalization of marijuana.The Liberals, however, have an official youth wing of the party that has long had an activist role. No such body exists within the Conservatives though there are proposals at the convention to change that.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tThere is already a network of Conservative youth clubs across the country, including one at McGill University.There, members organized an online fundraising campaign to send as many people as they could to this weekend\u2019s convention.The fact that money has been pledged from Conservative MPs \u2014 including at least two people thinking about running for leader \u2014 is a sign the party recognizes youth need to be part of the party\u2019s rebuilding process, said Adam Wilson, 20, the president of the Conservative Association of McGill University.Young voters have been written off in the past because of the perception they don\u2019t engage; but turnout in 2015 was higher than ever, he pointed out.A preliminary survey from Statistics Canada said in 2015 voter turnout for those between the ages of 18 to 24 increased to 67 per cent from 55 per cent in the 2011 vote.\u201c(The party) needs to make it clear they are welcoming to youth,\u201d Wilson said.\u201cEveryone always thinks the Conservatives are the old white male party of the right, but in reality that\u2019s not true.\u201d', u'Doctor-assisted dying expected to be hot topic at Liberal biennial convention in WinnipegWINNIPEG \u2013 Some grassroots Liberals are using the ruling party\u2019s first national convention since taking power last fall to challenge the Trudeau government\u2019s restrictive approach to medically assisted dying.Wendy Robbins, the policy chair for the Liberals\u2019 national women\u2019s commission, is spearheading a push to get an emergency resolution added to the agenda of the convention, which begins today in Winnipeg and runs until Saturday.The resolution calls on the government to amend its controversial proposed law on assisted death before putting it to a final vote, which the government is aiming to do on Monday.It urges the government to drop the bill\u2019s restrictive eligibility criteria and adopt instead the more permissive criteria set out by the Supreme Court when it struck down the ban on assisted dying last year.And it urges the government to allow advance requests for medical assistance in dying.Robbins is hoping to have the resolution adopted today by members of the women\u2019s commission, which was the prime mover behind a resolution to legalize medical assistance in dying that was approved at the last Liberal convention in 2014.However, emergency resolutions must be accepted by the party\u2019s national policy committee to make it to the floor of the convention and there\u2019s no guarantee Robbins\u2019 resolution will get that far.Indeed, Robbins said she\u2019s come under \u201ca certain amount of pressure\u201d from senior Liberals to withdraw the resolution in the interests of demonstrating a united front behind the fledgling government\u2019s first important piece of legislation.\u201cThey really don\u2019t want grassroots Liberals to embarrass them,\u201d she said.But while party brass may be loathe to challenge the government, Robbins predicted the resolution would get plenty of support from convention delegates, if they\u2019re ever given the chance to vote on it.From the government\u2019s perspective, a debate over the assisted dying bill would mar what was otherwise shaping up to be a celebratory post-election convention undisturbed by controversy.The biggest item on the agenda involves not policy but the internal operations of the Liberal party: a proposal to overhaul its constitution to, among other things, do away with the concept of membership, giving anyone willing to register as a Liberal the opportunity to vote in leadership and nomination contests, attend conventions and take part in policy development.Some rank and file Liberals have mounted a campaign to reject the proposed new constitution, which they fear would give too much discretion to party brass to run the party as they see fit.Debate over legalization of assisted dying dominated the last Liberal convention. Since then, the Supreme Court has struck down the ban on assisted death and the government has been scrambling to enact a new law before June 6, when the top court\u2019s ruling goes into effect.It has introduced Bill C-14, which would make assisted death available only for clearly consenting adults \u201cin an advanced stage of irreversible decline\u201d from a serious and incurable disease, illness or disability and for whom natural death is \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201dThat\u2019s considerably more restrictive than the criteria set out by the Supreme Court, which ruled that consenting adults with \u201cgrievous and irremediable\u201d medical conditions who are enduring suffering that is intolerable to them have the right to seek medical help to end their lives.When the government first introduced C-14, Robbins said she was \u201cstunned.\u201dRequiring a person to be close to death before they can get medical help to end their suffering is \u201cabsolutely appalling,\u201d she added.Robbins\u2019 resolution calls on the government to immediately allow people to make advance requests for an assisted death once they\u2019re diagnosed with a grievous condition, like dementia, that will eventually render them incapable of giving informed consent.And it calls for an independent commission to explore the question of allowing advance directives even before a diagnosis is made.Robbins said that would allow a people to make their wish for an assisted death known in the event that they suffer an unexpected, catastrophic event, like a massive stroke.\u201cAs long as people are competent, they should be able to make end-of-life decisions,\u201d she said.', u'Filipino president-elect Duterte apologizes to Trudeau for Canadian\u2019s beheading by militantsSHIMA, Japan \u2013 A spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there\u2019s a good chance the Group of Seven leaders will agree that their countries should not pay ransom to terrorists.Peter Boehm, Trudeau\u2019s personal representative at the G7, told reporters there\u2019s a good chance that position will be included in the communique from the summit this week in Japan.\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing sense that the problem isn\u2019t going away, that citizens of our countries can be in danger at any time and by paying ransom you are just aiding and abetting terrorists,\u201d said Boehm, the deputy minister of international development who served as Canada\u2019s ambassador to Germany from 2008-2012.He added that Trudeau has been pushing for the G7 leaders to join Canada in refusing to pay ransoms to kidnappers.Boehm\u2019s comments followed a media report from the Philippines that says Trudeau has received an apology from Filipino president-elect Rodrigo Duterte for the killing of Canadian hostage John Ridsdel.The online report by Rappler says Duterte told a news conference he apologized to Trudeau on Tuesday when the Canadian prime minister called to congratulate him on his recent election victory.The militants had been asking for a ransom payment in exchange for Ridsdel\u2019s release before he was beheaded last month.Another Canadian, , was kidnapped by the same group and is still being held hostage in the Asian country.The Rappler report also says Duterte said Trudeau brought up the \u201cuniversal declaration of human rights.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m following it \u2014 I said that we are partners, may we remain partners for all time,\u201d Duterte said, according to Rappler.\u201cPlease accept my apologies for the incident that resulted in the killing of your national and we will try our very best to make sure nothing of the sort will happen again.\u201dThe report said Duterte described his nine-minute conversation with Trudeau as a \u201ccivil\u201d one.He also said he commended Trudeau for the protection of Filipino workers in Canada, Rappler reported.\u201cI am aware there are Filipinos, a lot of them, working there,\u201d said Duterte.\u201cI am happy that they have found protection even in the labour laws.\u201dA spokesman for Trudeau confirmed that the prime minister spoke with Duterte, but declined to offer details of the call.Cameron Ahmad says the Canadian government won\u2019t comment or release any information that could compromise ongoing efforts or endanger the safety of the remaining hostages.Ahmad says the government\u2019s first priority is the safety and security of its citizens.The militants released a video showing Ridsdel\u2019s beheading, an American group that monitors jihadi websites said after his killing.Ridsdel, 68, of Calgary, was one of four tourists \u2014 including Hall, Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad and Filipina Marites Flor \u2014 who were kidnapped last Sept. 21 by Abu Sayyaf militants.In a series of tweets, Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group cited the video as saying Ridsdel was beheaded on April 25 \u201cdue to non-compliance\u201d of the Canadian government.Ridsdel was beheaded after Abu Sayyaf militants made a large ransom demand for his release.Trudeau has said Canada would never pay ransom for the release of hostages.\u201cPaying ransom for Canadians would endanger the lives of every single one of the millions of Canadians who live work and travel around the world every single year,\u201d Trudeau said earlier this month.A senior official said at the time that the RCMP was conducting a criminal investigation into Ridsdel\u2019s murder.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the ongoing hostage case, said the Mounties were relying on the extraterritorial provisions of the Criminal Code to pursue the overseas investigation.The two Canadians, Sekkingstad, who is a permanent resident of Canada, and the Filipina woman were snatched from a marina.Ridsdel\u2019s body was found by villagers beside a dry creek in a mountain near Talipao town in Sulu province. Police recovered his head in Sulu\u2019s Jolo town.', u'Liberals to roll back public-sector bargaining changes made by ToriesOTTAWA \u2013 The federal Liberals say they\u2019ll roll back changes to public-sector bargaining brought in by the previous Conservative government.Treasury Board President Scott Brison says in a release that portions of the 2013 omnibus budget bill will be formally repealed with new legislation when Parliament returns from the summer recess next fall.The Conservative changes allowed the government to unilaterally decide which employees offered essential services and therefore determine who was allowed to strike.The 2013 bill also made salary arbitration dependent on the government\u2019s budget priorities, curtailing the independence of the process.Public-sector unions promised a constitutional challenge to what they said was an attack on collective bargaining.The Liberal government has already introduced legislation to repeal two other controversial Conservative-era labour bills that would have forced all unions to publicly disclose their internal financial workings and changed the process for union certification and de-certification.\u201cBy restoring fair and balanced labour laws, the government is recognizing that labour unions play an important role protecting workers\u2019 rights and strengthening the middle class,\u201d Brison said in a news release Wednesday.\u201cAs another important step in rebuilding the relationship with Canada\u2019s public service, we are moving to repeal changes to the public service labour relations regime brought into law by the previous government.\u201d', u'Protesters clash with police outside Trump rally in CaliforniaANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A day after violent protesters outside a Donald Trump rally threw burning items at police and toppled barricades, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee railed against \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton and leaders in his own party who haven\u2019t yet endorsed him in a boisterous but less heated rally on Wednesday.Outside, demonstrators quietly held up signs reading \u2018Love and Peace\u201d and \u201cMigration is beautiful\u201d during the rally, but the modest crowd grew rowdier when Trump supporters came outside. The two sides shouted at each other as dozens of police, some on horseback, moved in to prevent a renewal of the violence that included rock-throwing and burning T-shirts Tuesday night in New Mexico.Five people were arrested as a line of police slowly moved scattered protesters along a nearby street.Inside, Trump\u2019s rally was interrupted several times by protesters who were escorted out of the Anaheim Convention Center, which was packed with thousands of Trump supporters.\u201cGet \u2019em out!\u201d he shouted at one point. \u201cOut! Out! Out!\u201d But Trump urged his supporters and security to handle his interrupters gently. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt \u2019em,\u201d he told them. \u201cI say that for the television cameras. Do not hurt him even though he\u2019s a bad person.\u201dLater, a pair of protesters in the stands behind the candidate ripped a Trump sign in half and made a rude gesture toward the crowd.As for Clinton, Trump noted Wednesday\u2019s report by the State Department inspector general that faulted her for her use of private email for official business when she was secretary of state.Trump said that he was eager to run against Clinton, but wondered aloud, as he often does, whether she would actually be the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee.Trump appeared to be making a concerted effort on Wednesday to tout his support with women. He met with a group of female business leaders ahead of the rally and invited several onstage. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, women do like me,\u201d he said.But later he went after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been vigorously criticizing him.\u201cShe gets nothing done, nothing passed. She\u2019s got a big mouth, and that\u2019s about it,\u201d he said of Warren. \u201cBut they use her because Hillary\u2019s trying to be very presidential. She\u2019s stopping with the shouting, OK?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I cannot listen to her,\u201d he added of Clinton.Trump\u2019s western swing comes as he works to unify a Republican Party that often remains skeptical of his candidacy. During the rally, Trump offered jabs at 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and former rival Jeb Bush, who have yet to endorse his candidacy.House Speaker Paul Ryan is still holding out on endorsing Trump even as his staff and other House Republicans and aides communicate increasingly closely with the Trump campaign on policy.Meeting with reporters Wednesday, Ryan shot down rumors that an endorsement was imminent. \u201cI don\u2019t have a timeline in my mind and I have not made a decision and nothing\u2019s changed from that perspective,\u201d he said.Later in the day his staff disclosed that Ryan planned to speak with Trump Wednesday evening by phone but insisted it was not about endorsing. \u201cThe purpose of the call tonight is for the two of them to continue their conversation about unifying the party,\u201d said spokesman Zack Roday.Before the Anaheim rally, police issued a firm warning to protesters that violence would not be tolerated following the clashes between anti-Trump protesters and police in New Mexico a day earlier.In one of the presidential campaign year\u2019s more unruly spectacles, anti-Trump protesters had thrown burning T-shirts, plastic bottles and other items at police officers, injuring several, and had toppled trash cans and barricades.Police responded by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades into the crowd outside the Albuquerque Convention Center.In Anaheim, pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators clashed last month at Anaheim City Hall when the City Council discussed a resolution criticizing Trump as divisive. Rally attendees arrived early Wednesday, weaving through a maze of police barricades and security checkpoints before entering the venue.The violence in New Mexico has prompted security concerns beyond neighboring California. Police in Bismarck, North Dakota, said Wednesday they would dedicate about a quarter of their force for security when Trump heads to the state Thursday.Sgt. Mark Buschena said about 30 officers would be assigned to the event at the Bismarck Civic Center. Trump is keynoting the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference and Expo, with about 7,000 people expected to attend.Trump was also scheduled to attend a TV taping and a fundraiser in the Los Angeles area Wednesday evening. He\u2019ll be back in California on Friday with visits to Fresno and San Diego.', u'5 things to watch for at upcoming Tory conventionOTTAWA \u2013 Hundreds of federal Conservative party members gather in Vancouver on Thursday for a three-day policy convention.It\u2019s their first meeting since the fall election that saw leader Stephen Harper leave his job after losing government to the Liberals.Here are five things to watch for:The former prime minister is set to address the convention on Thursday night. It\u2019s his first public speech in Canada since he lost the election and stepped down as party leader. He\u2019s kept a low profile in Ottawa since and is expected to do the same at the convention after his brief address. It may be the last time for the party to hear from him as an MP, as he is expected to resign his seat in the Commons in the coming weeks.The convention is a prime opportunity for people seeking to replace interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose at the party\u2019s helm to make connections and for party members to get a measure of the candidates. Kellie Leitch, Maxime Bernier and Michael Chong are the only three candidates officially registered and are sure to have a high profile on and off the convention floor. But others thinking about a bid will also be making the rounds, including TV personality and businessman Kevin O\u2019Leary.While  has appeared to squelch a drive to get her to run for the leadership, it may not be dead yet. A petition seeking to change the party\u2019s constitution to allow interim leaders to run for the permanent job continues to circulate. If there\u2019s enough support, it could be brought forward at a constitutional workshop session on Friday and, if it passed there, handed over to the general membership for a vote.There are dozens of proposed policy changes set to be debated. One that many are closely watching is a bid to drop language from the existing platform that says the party supports legislation defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Several riding associations are seeking to have that section deleted, arguing it\u2019s no longer necessary to have a divisive policy on the books.Many convention delegates are headed to Vancouver seeking to return more control over party affairs to the rank-and-file membership. Several constitutional amendments suggest a there is lot of tension over how Harper and party brass ran the show. Delegates are arguing for more transparency and oversight on how the party spends its money, elects its leadership and other issues.', u'Canada\u2019s defence industry increasingly selling abroad: reportCanada\u2019s defence industry is increasingly selling its wares abroad, according to a new joint report from the economic development ministry and a defence industry association.The \u201cState of Canada\u2019s Defence Industry 2014\u201d report found that Canada\u2019s defence industry sold about $5.95 billion of weapons, equipment and services outside of Canada \u2013 representing about 60 per cent of industry sales. That amount grew by 20 per cent since 2011.Here are some more things to note about Canada\u2019s defence industry.According to Philippe Richer from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, approximately 70 per cent of Canadian defence exports went to the US in 2014. Another 20 to 25 per cent went to Europe.But, it\u2019s hard to check these figures: country-based statistics weren\u2019t part of this report because many companies didn\u2019t fill out that part of the survey. Because the data was so full of holes, said Richer, they couldn\u2019t release it.Luckily, there is a different, if less complete survey to look at for clues.Once you take the U.S. out of the equation, Saudi Arabia was Canada\u2019s top customer in 2013, according to . U.S. figures are not generally reported by the department because the statistics are based on permits, and many permits aren\u2019t required for U.S. exports. So, we don\u2019t know how much was exported to the U.S.\xa0Obviously, the countries Canada sells to can change year by year, depending on what contracts get signed and delivered.Again, not counting the U.S., the top countries that Canada exported to in 2013 were:That\u2019s about the same as the beverage and tobacco manufacturing industry and the postal and courier industry. The report also estimates that the industry employs about 63,000 people across Canada. They\u2019re generally higher-wage jobs than the average manufacturing job too, according to the report.Ontario and Quebec specialize in combat vehicles, Atlantic Canada focuses on military aircraft and ship maintenance, and Western and Northern Canada focus on aircraft maintenance and repair and shipbuilding.Overall, Canada\u2019s top-selling defence industry activity is combat vehicle construction, repair and \u201cother defence\u201d representing about $2.8 billion. Yes, this is one large, strange category.Aircraft maintenance and repair accounted for about $2 billion, and aircraft fabrication and components were worth $1 billion.', u'Trudeau took a day off in the name of \u2018work-life balance\u2019 \u2013 should we all follow suit? has unwittingly stirred up a national debate about work-life balance, one that experts say has the potential to influence some healthy lifestyle changes in some Canadians.Conservative critics and skeptical Canadians have expressed concerns about the leader\u2019s decision to take a personal day in the midst of his trip to Japan,  in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.Trudeau cleared his schedule Wednesday to take his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, to a romantic inn  \u2013 a decision he said is an example of \u201cthe kind of work-life balance that I\u2019ve often talked about as being essential in order to be able to be in service of the country with all one\u2019s very best.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see your hubbub about nannies and extra help and raise you an anniversary abroad. Bold,\u201d Andrew MacDougall, a former communications director for Stephen Harper, quipped on Twitter.And while there are some questions surrounding the logistics of taking a spa day in the midst of a political trip (the prime minister\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t say how many staff he has in tow \u2014 although Trudeau noted he personally paid for the getaway), some argued the move was a selfish waste of taxpayer dollars.But some believe that Trudeau is setting a good example \u2014 one that more people should consider following.\u201cPeople generally need to try to create that kind of balance and take time off if it\u2019s possible \u2014 especially when there are important events or occasions,\u201d said Dr. Scott Schieman, \u201cI think even the prime minister deserves a day or two. It\u2019s a question of what\u2019s reasonable \u2014 one would imagine that he probably works all the time.\u201dAccording to Schieman, multiple studies have shown that achieving a good work-life balance \u2014 or taking time to focus on yourself or your family when needed \u2014 can improve overall work ethic and performance. Not to mention it\u2019s good for your sanity.The 2011 Canadian Work Stress and Health study found roughly one\xa0in three\xa0Canadians feel overwhelmed by work and the demands of their job.But Schieman believes all Canadians can achieve the kind of work-life balance that Trudeau appears to embrace.His best advice for doing so: take a hard look at all of the roles you encompass \u2014 from your career, to your relationship or caretaker roles \u2014 and understand what it is people really expect from you.If that means you think it\u2019s important to spend your anniversary at a romantic inn to foster the health of your marriage, then do so.\u201cThe example [Trudeau] is setting is not about balance \u2014 but about sticking to what is important to you,\u201d said Caird Urquhart, \u201cOne of his core values is family and marriage. That is going to stabilize him in the long run because he is honouring something that is important to him.\u201d', 'Obama gives hip hop history lesson after Vietnamese rapper rhymes for himU.S. President Barack Obama completed a three-day trip to Vietnam with a town hall meeting in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday.As usual, Obama incorporated a question-and-answer session with the young leaders, which led to an impromptu performance by Vietnamese rapper Suboi.After she performed an a cappella verse, Suboi and Obama discussed gender stereotypes in music.The meeting involved about 800 young adults taking part in efforts to strengthen ties between the United States and Southeast Asia.In Vietnam, he met participants in the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.The initiative targets adults under the age of 35 in a variety of educational and cultural exchanges.Obama will shortly fly to Japan as part of a trip that will include the first visit to Hiroshima since the end of World War II by a sitting U.S. president.', u'Stephen Harper is leaving politicsFormer prime minister Stephen Harper will be stepping down from his job as an MP before the fall session of Parliament kicks off.Global News has confirmed that Harper intends to leave politics sometime over the summer.He remained in office following the Conservative loss in last year\u2019s federal election, and has attended a majority of votes in the House since then. Harper was replaced on an interim basis by Rona Ambrose, and the party is expected to select a new leader in spring\xa02017.Harper has not spoken in the House of Commons since he was prime minister, and has not granted any media interviews\xa0since the election. He typically enters and leaves Parliament Hill\u2019s Centre Block through a back door.Harper\u2019s future could include work on a number of boards or he may set up his own institute, according to a\xa0Globe and Mail report. His priorities\xa0will reportedly be in areas like geopolitics and global free trade. That comes as no surprise to Harper\u2019s former\xa0cabinet colleague and former president of the Treasury Board, Tony Clement.\u201cI always thought that Stephen Harper wouldn\u2019t just be about corporate boards \u2026 he\u2019s got an intellectual curiosity and depth that goes beyond those things,\u201d Clement said, adding that Harper is very unlikely to meddle in domestic affairs.Clement added that\xa0Harper\u2019s decision to bow out within a year of the election is \u201centirely appropriate\u201d and that he wishes his former leader well.\u201cI\xa0think he\u2019s at peace with himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe, and I believe he that he believes, that history will treat his prime minister-ship well \u2026\xa0We all knew that he was making plans to move on with his life.\u201dFormer Tory strategist Tim Powers said Harper\u2019s departure is as much about the Conservative brand as it is about his personal career path.\xa0The role of \u201cinternational agent provocateur\u201d will\xa0likely appeal to the former PM, said Powers, and he may find himself modelling his future career on that of former British prime minister Tony Blair, pushing international policy and ideas.As for how history will remember Harper, Powers said it\u2019s far too early to say.', u'Riot breaks out at Donald Trump rally in New MexicoALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2013 In one of the presidential campaign year\u2019s more grisly spectacles, protesters in New Mexico opposing Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy threw burning T-shirts, plastic bottles and other items at police officers, injuring several, and toppled trash cans and barricades.Police responded by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades into the crowd outside the Albuquerque Convention Center.During the rally, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, who shouted, held up banners and resisted removal by security officers.The banners included the messages \u201cTrump is Fascist\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve heard enough.\u201dTrump lashed back at protesters, tweeting Wednesday: \u201cThe protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!\u201dAt one point, a female protester was physically dragged from the stands by security. Other protesters scuffled with security as they resisted removal from the convention centre, which was packed with thousands of loud and cheering Trump supporters.Trump responded with his usual bluster, instructing security to remove the protesters and mocking their actions by telling them to \u201cGo home to mommy.\u201dHe responded to one demonstrator by asking, \u201cHow old is this kid?\u201d Then he provided his own answer: \u201cStill wearing diapers.\u201dTrump\u2019s supporters responded with chants of \u201cBuild that wall!\u201dTrump later tweeted \u201cGreat rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd!\u201dThe altercations left glass at the entrance of the convention centre smashed.Albuquerque attorney Doug Antoon said rocks were flying through the convention centre windows as he was leaving Tuesday night. Glass was breaking and landing near his feet.\u201cThis was not a protest, this was a riot. These are hate groups,\u201d he said of the demonstrators.Albuquerque police said several officers were treated for injuries after getting hit by rocks thrown by protesters. At least one person was arrested from the riot, police said.During the rally, protesters outside overran barricades and clashed with police in riot gear. They also burned T-shirts and other items labeled with Trump\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201dTuesday marked Trump\u2019s first stop in New Mexico, the nation\u2019s most Hispanic state. Gov. Susana Martinez, head of the Republican Governors Association and the nation\u2019s only Latina governor, has harshly criticized his remarks on immigrants and has attacked his proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The governor did not attend the rally and has yet to make an endorsement.Trump read off a series of negative statistics about the state, including an increase in the number of people on food stamps.\u201cWe have to get your governor to get going. She\u2019s got to do a better job, OK?\u201d he said, adding: \u201cHey, maybe I\u2019ll run for governor of New Mexico. I\u2019ll get this place going.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office fired back, saying Martinez has fought for welfare reform.\u201cThe potshots weren\u2019t about policy, they were about politics,\u201d said spokesman Michael Lonergan. \u201cAnd the Governor will not be bullied into supporting a candidate until she is convinced that candidate will fight for New Mexicans, and she did not hear that today.\u201dTrump supporters at the rally said they appreciated his stance on boosting border security and stemming the flow of people crossing the border illegally, but some said they were frightened by the violent protests outside.Karla Molinar, a University of New Mexico student, said she participated in disrupting Trump\u2019s speech because she felt he was attacking members of her family who are living in the country illegally. She said she believes Trump is using them as scapegoats for the nation\u2019s problems.Associated Press writer Susan Montoya Bryan contributed to this report from Albuquerque.', u'Provincial medical regulators set detailed guidelines for doctor-assisted dyingOTTAWA \u2013 Medical regulators in every province have issued detailed guidelines doctors must follow to help suffering patients end their lives once Canada\u2019s ban on medically assisted dying is formally lifted next month.And most of those guidelines impose safeguards similar to \u2013 or even more stringent than \u2013 those included in the federal government\u2019s proposed new law on assisted death.The existence of guidelines in every province undercuts federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould\u2019s contention that there\u2019ll be a dangerous legal void if the government\u2019s controversial new law on assisted dying isn\u2019t enacted by June 6.That\u2019s the date on which the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling last year, striking down the ban on medically assisted dying, goes into effect. The court suspended the ruling for 16 months to give the federal government time to enact a new law that allows assisted dying for clearly consenting adults with \u201cgrievous and irremediable\u201d medical conditions who are enduring suffering that is intolerable to them.Wilson-Raybould and Health Minister Jane Philpott have issued seemingly contradictory warnings about the dire consequences that will unfold if the proposed legislation isn\u2019t in force by June 6 \u2013 a feat that seems increasingly unlikely.They maintain assisted death will be readily available without any safeguards to protect the vulnerable. At the same time, they contend many doctors will refuse to provide assistance in dying because of uncertainty about who is eligible.Their arguments are \u201cfalse,\u201d says Josh Paterson, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, a plaintiff in the case that led to the Supreme Court striking down the ban on assisted dying.\u201cNobody is going to be left wondering what they\u2019re going to do on June 6. Everything in terms of the medical profession is ready to go \u2026 We\u2019re not jumping into a void here, we\u2019re not on the edge of a cliff.\u201dLike the proposed federal law, most of the various guidelines produced by provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons require that at least two doctors must agree that a patient meets the eligibility criteria for an assisted death, that a patient must submit a written request signed by witnesses, that there be a waiting period between the request and the provision of an assisted death, that a patient must be competent to give free, informed consent throughout the process, up to the time of dying.Some impose more stringent safeguards, for instance putting the age of consent at 19 rather than the federally proposed 18, and requiring a psychiatric assessment in cases where depression or mental illness might impair a patient\u2019s ability to give consent.The one big difference, said Paterson, is that the provincial guidelines rely on the relatively permissive eligibility criteria spelled out by the Supreme Court whereas the federal government is proposing more restrictive conditions.The legislation would allow assisted death only for consenting adults who are in \u201can advanced stage of irreversible decline\u201d from a serious and incurable disease, illness or disability and for whom a natural death is \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201dThe Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada has expressed concern that \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d death is \u201clegal language that is far too vague\u201d to enable doctors to confidently determine who is eligible for a medically assisted death.\u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u2026 For all of us, death is reasonably foreseeable,\u201d Dr. Trevor Theman, registrar of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons and past president of FMRAC, said in an interview.While they struggle to interpret aspects of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling as well, Theman said the court\u2019s eligibility criteria is more manageable for regulators.Yet the federal government has all but ignored the wishes of medical regulators and the guidelines they\u2019ve produced, citing instead approval of its proposed law by the Canadian Medical Association, which lobbies on behalf of doctors but does not regulate, license or discipline them.\u201cSo it may be that they see a void (if the legislation isn\u2019t enacted by June 6) because they\u2019re not used to dealing with us and they\u2019re less aware of what we\u2019re capable of.\u201dThe three territories do not have independent medical regulatory authorities. However, the Yukon government has issued guidelines for doctors similar to those produced in the provinces and the Northwest Territories government has promised to do the same by June 6.Only Nunavut is waiting to see the final shape of the federal law. Even there, Paterson noted the eligibility criteria laid down by the Supreme Court will still apply, as in the rest of the country.Notwithstanding Wilson-Raybould\u2019s dire warnings, it seems well nigh impossible for the proposed legislation to be enacted by June 6. Even should the House of Commons pass the bill Monday, the first day back after a break week, that would leave less than a week for the bill to go through all stages of the legislative process in the Senate \u2013 a rush few senators appear inclined to accommodate.', u'Canada not certain on joining anti-ISIS mission in Libya: VanceOTTAWA \u2013 Canada\u2019s top general says military intervention in Libya is not inevitable.Gen. Jonathan Vance, the chief of the defence staff, says he\u2019s not advocating one way or another for Canada to join a possible western military coalition in Libya.He says it is not inevitable that a new military mission will be needed to get rid of Islamic militants in Libya, but he\u2019s keeping a close watch so he can advise the government.\t\t\t\n\t\tVance says much will depend on the performance of Libya\u2019s new, United Nations-brokered government and what assistance it may ask for.Vance says the foothold gained by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya\u2019s port city of Sirte remains a serious impediment to stabilizing the country.But he says simply throwing military assets at the situation is not a solution on its own.', u'Obama dines with chef Anthony Bourdain in Vietnam, shows off chopstick skillsU.S. President Barack Obama taped the second part of an interview with CNN personality Anthony Bourdain on Tuesday before leaving the Vietnamese capital for his next stop: Ho Chi Minh City.Obama and Bourdain met in a small complex in Hanoi\u2019s Me Tri neighbourhood in a heavy downpour.A day earlier, Obama also dined with the celebrity chef to film the first portion of their Hanoi rendezvous.Bourdain and the president reportedly discussed the purpose of Obama\u2019s trip to Asia and his interest in the people, food and culture of Vietnam.Following the meal, Bourdain called Obama\u2019s chopstick skills \u201con point.\u201dA huge crowd gathered outside the restaurant Bun cha Huong Lien on Monday, then let out a cheer when the president came out.Obama shook a lot of hands and waved repeatedly before vanishing into the motorcade.Bourdain later tweeted that the meal cost six dollars U.S., and he picked up the check.Bourdain\u2019s  food travelogue is one of the network\u2019s most popular nonfiction series.Each episode of Bourdain\u2019s show follows him as he travels to a different part of the world to explore that area\u2019s culture, primarily by sharing in the area\u2019s distinct native cuisine.The interview with Obama will be featured in the eighth season of , which begins in September.', u'\u2018He\u2019s Teflon\u2019: Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings remain high as Canadians shrug off elbowgateA majority of Canadians say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s \u201celbow incident\u201d in the House of Commons last week was \u201cno big deal,\u201d and that it\u2019s time to move on.A new poll from Ipsos, conducted in the wake of \xa0on behalf of Global News, revealed that 63 per cent of respondents believed that the incident \u201cis no big deal,\u201d that it \u201cwas a momentary lapse in judgment by the Prime Minister that he has already apologized for\u201d and that \u201cwe should all just move on.\u201dBut a minority (37 per cent) said there was no excuse for Trudeau behaving the way he did, and that the incident \u201craises serious questions about his maturity and judgment.\u201dConservative voters were far more likely to believe this than Liberal voters, with 70 per cent judging it to be a serious issue.The prime minister, for the upcoming G7 summit, found himself apologizing repeatedly in the House of Commons last week after he marched across the centre aisle and grabbed Conservative Whip Gordon Brown, whose path was being blocked by a group of NDP members.Trudeau allegedly swore and then\xa0elbowed the NDP\u2019s Ruth-Ellen Brosseau in the chest during the ensuing fracas. In spite of this,\xa0NDP supporters polled by Ipsos were quite\xa0forgiving, with 56 per cent willing to give Trudeau a pass.That didn\u2019t come as a big\xa0surprise to Darrell Bricker, CEO at Ipsos Global Public Affairs.While had predicted the end of the Liberal \u201choneymoon\u201d and speculated Trudeau\u2019s outburst would lead to a drop\xa0in his personal\xa0approval ratings, the poll does not support this.Six in ten Canadians still approve (19 per cent strongly and 43 per cent somewhat) of the performance of the Liberal government under Trudeau, a drop of four points since the last such survey in March.Meanwhile, four in ten Canadians surveyed by Ipsos disapprove of the government\u2019s performance under Trudeau (17 per cent strongly and 21 per cent somewhat).Other\xa0polls conducted over the past week have yielded similar results. A  survey\xa0after the elbow incident revealed Trudeau has hit an all-time high in terms of who\xa0Canadians prefer as prime minister, with nearly 54 per cent of respondents naming him as their favourite. An\xa0\xa0poll found that 70 per cent of respondents said the\xa0elbowing incident had\xa0no impact on their view of Trudeau.The government also remains\xa0in a very comfortable position\xa0when it comes to voting intention.If an election were held tomorrow, the poll indicates that the Liberals would receive 46 per cent of the decided popular vote compared to 30 per cent for the Tories under Rona Ambrose.The NDP and out-going leader Tom Mulcair would receive 15 per cent support. Approximately 4 per cent would go to the Bloc Quebecois, and 5 per cent to the Greens and other parties.\xa0', u'Mike Duffy legal woes end as Crown won\u2019t appeal acquittalOTTAWA \u2013 Sen. \u2018s legal saga is officially over.A spokesman for the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General says Crown prosecutors have decided not to appeal Duffy\u2019s acquittal one month ago.Today was the deadline to file an appeal.Ministry spokesman Brendan Crawley says the Crown decided there is no legal basis for an appeal.Duffy was acquitted in April on 31 criminal charges, including fraud, breach of trust and bribery, stemming from his Senate expenses.At the time, Duffy\u2019s trial judge was critical of the Crown\u2019s case, saying that prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Duffy acted unlawfully.The Crown withdrew charges of fraud and breach of trust last week against retired Liberal senator Mac Harb and the RCMP announced it wouldn\u2019t pursue .That leaves Patrick Brazeau as the only senator still facing criminal prosecution over his housing expenses.', u'Canada offers $331.5M in global humanitarian aid at summit in IstanbulOTTAWA \u2013 International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has announced an additional $331.5 million in humanitarian aid at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey.Bibeau says in a statement Tuesday that the new funding will help the most vulnerable in more than 32 countries.Those who will receive the funding include United Nations humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations, as well as Canadian organizations.Today\u2019s announcement was made on the final day of the summit.On Monday, Bibeau announced $274 million in humanitarian and development aid that focused on emergency response, child protection and food security.During the summit, the statement says Bibeau emphasized the need to focus on women and girls in every humanitarian response, as well as Canada\u2019s commitment to be innovative and make every dollar count. She also assured that Canada will continue to defend humanitarian principles.', u'Trudeau tries to woo Japanese automakers ahead of G7 SummitTOKYO \u2013 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally invited Japanese auto executives Tuesday in Tokyo to invest more in Canada.But it\u2019s unclear whether he will secure concrete commitments from the companies on his first trip to Japan since taking office last fall.Trudeau met with auto parts manufacturers and the presidents of three auto companies: Honda, Toyota and Subaru.The CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries, the firm that makes Subaru, told Trudeau he doesn\u2019t have any plans to expand capacity in the near term, though he might in the future, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary Cameron Ahmad said after the meeting.\u201cThank you for agreeing to meet with us,\u201d Trudeau said to Yasuyuki Yoshinaga after they exchanged greetings at the residence of Canada\u2019s ambassador to Japan.\u201cI look forward to talking about tremendous opportunities to create success for Canada and for Japan through economic engagement.\u201dUnlike Toyota and Honda, Subaru does not have an operation in Canada.As part of his pitch, the prime minister also told Yoshinaga that Canadians are innovative and focused on high quality.Trudeau will also sit down Tuesday with his Japanese counterpart to discuss the countries\u2019 business ties as well as security co-operation before the Group of Seven summit later this week.His agenda for his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe includes issues like investment, education and trade, such as the huge 12-country treaty known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, visited the Meiji Shrine and will meet the emperor and empress of Japan before the prime minister sits down with Abe.For his part, Abe is expected to raise a pressing subject for the Japanese: regional security.Japan is deeply concerned about North Korea\u2019s recent nuclear tests and missile launches as well as an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea.Following their meeting in February, Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida issued a statement reconfirming their commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in international maritime law.Without naming China, they also said they opposed the use of intimidation, force or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific.When it comes to China, Keio University law professor Masayuki Tadokoro said Japan will listen carefully to Trudeau\u2019s words on the matter. The concern is Canada may not want to take very strong position due its economic interests in China.\u201cCanada has always been watching toward the east and south because Canada is an Atlantic state,\u201d Kenjiro Monji, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in an interview last week.\u201cCanada is also a Pacific nation and it is only recently that Canadians started to look to the west, but only through economic lenses.\u201dAbe is also expected to urge Trudeau to move quickly to open up Canadian liquefied natural gas exports to Japan.Japan, the world\u2019s biggest importer of LNG, is hoping Canada will issue necessary environmental permits to allow companies to export it from British Columbia.Monji said LNG is still very important energy source for his country, which makes Canada one of the most promising potential exporters to Japan. He noted that Japanese companies are involved in several LNG projects in Canada.Trudeau\u2019s Tokyo visit comes ahead of the G7 summit on Thursday and Friday in Ise-Shima.', u'Trudeau celebrates wedding anniversary in Japan before attending G7 summitTOKYO \u2013 Justin Trudeau\u2019s trip to Japan for bilateral talks and the t will be about more than just business.The prime minister isn\u2019t planning to hold any meetings or events Wednesday, so he can celebrate his 11th wedding anniversary with his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau.The couple will spend the night at a traditional Japanese inn \u2013 or ryokan \u2013 before Trudeau heads to the G7 summit on Thursday in the country\u2019s Ise-Shima region.\u201cThe fact of the matter is we\u2019ve been working extremely hard today and will be at the G7 meetings on Thursday and Friday, and in the middle of all this, I\u2019m taking a moment to celebrate \u2013 on personal funds \u2013 my wedding anniversary with my wife,\u201d Trudeau said of the down time when asked during a news conference whether it would cost taxpayers anything, including the potential financial burden of idle staffers.\u201cThis is the kind of work-life balance that I\u2019ve often talked about as being essential in order to be able to be in service of the country with all one\u2019s very best and that\u2019s certainly something I\u2019m going to continue to make sure we do.\u201dGregoire Trudeau accompanied the prime minister Tuesday in Tokyo during visits to the Meiji Shrine and with the Japanese emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace.She also joined him Tuesday evening for dinner with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Trudeau held working meetings earlier in the day with Abe and executives from the Japanese auto sector.', u'Clinton says Trump could \u2018bankrupt America\u2019 like his companiesDETROIT \u2014 Hillary Clinton said Monday that Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies would lead to lower wages, fewer jobs and more debt \u2014 warning unionized workers that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee could \u201cbankrupt America like he\u2019s bankrupted his companies.\u201d\u201cAsk yourself,\u201d the likely Democratic nominee told thousands at the Service Employees International Union international convention in Detroit, \u201chow can anybody lose money running a casino, really?\u201dTrump has accused Clinton of using the \u201cthe woman\u2019s card\u201d to win votes. Clinton said if fighting for equal pay, paid family leave, a higher minimum wage and affordable child care is \u201cplaying the woman card, then deal me in.\u201dTrump\u2019s call for the deportation of millions of people living in the U.S. illegally and the end of automatic birthright citizenship also drew Clinton\u2019s ire. She criticized sending a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to schools, workplaces and homes to \u201cround up moms, dads, grandparents \u2014 even children.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s talking about kicking children who are born here out of the only country they know,\u201d Clinton said.The union endorsed Hillary in November. She thanked its members \u2014 who include child care workers, home health aides, janitors and others \u2014 and called them \u201cunsung heroes\u201d who deserve a living wage.\t\t\t\n\t\tShe said there has never been more at stake for working families than in the 2016 election, noting that she supports raising the federal minimum wage and protecting the right to organize.\u201cYour fights are my fights,\u201d she said.Clinton, pointing to the nearing end of the Democratic primary, applauded Vermont Sen.

But the social networking juggernaut maintains there is \u201cno evidence of systematic political bias.\u201dIn , Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said it took swift action to address allegations it \u201c\u201d news stories and topics that might be of interest to conservative Facebook users while tampering with its algorithm to promote other topics that weren\u2019t necessarily trending.\u201cOur data analysis indicated that conservative and liberal topics are approved as trending topics at virtually identical rates,\u201d read the statement, following an internal investigation and a meeting last week between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and John Thune, chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee.The claims were first made in a May 9 article on the tech website  (an arm of Gawker media).Trending topics were introduced in 2014 and appear in a separate section to the right of the Facebook newsfeed. According to Facebook, potential trending topics are first determined by a software formula, or algorithm, that identifies topics that have spiked in popularity on the site.The Gizmodo article alleged the Trending Topics section \u201coperates like a traditional newsroom, reflecting the biases of its workers and the institutional imperatives of the corporation.\u201dGizmodo cited an anonymous former news curator who identified as \u201cpolitically conservative.\u201d The purported former employee reportedly said topics were elected \u201csubjectively\u201d depending on employee shifts.Facebook admitted it was possible there may be \u201cisolated improper actions or unintentional bias\u201d and, as such, would implement a number of improvements \u2014 including more employee training and greater oversight and review.Facebook also promised to cease relying on \u201clists of external websites and news outlets to identify, validate or assess the importance of particular topics.\u201d That lists also included several conservative-oriented media such as Fox News, the Daily Caller, the Drudge Report, the , and Beck\u2019s website The Blaze.In a letter to Senate Committee Chairman Thune, Stretch addressed specific content that Facebook allegedly sidelined, including posts about Romney, Cruz and Beck, as well as posts about late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle \u2014 the subject of the film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d.', u'Notley gets kudos in handling Fort McMurray wildfire crisis, but hard work yet to comeEDMONTON \u2013 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is getting high marks for leadership in handling the Fort McMurray wildfire crisis, but political observers say the disaster remains a dicey political proposition with limited upside and a lot of downside.Political scientist Duane Bratt says the process of getting people back into their homes and getting aid and reconstruction money will tell the tale on how Notley will be remembered in the long term for her handling of the crisis.\u201cOn the political side \u2026 if you handle it well, it\u2019s a short term blip,\u201d said Bratt, a political scientist with Mount Royal University in Calgary. \u201cIf you screw it up, it never goes away.\u201dAbout 80,000 evacuees begin returning in phases to Fort McMurray\xa0on June 1, almost a month after a raging blaze broke through the\xa0firelines and destroyed 2,400 structures, most of them houses.Since then Notley has become the face and focus of efforts to contain the blaze, save the city, and get it back on its feet.She has given almost daily updates for three weeks.It\u2019s been an organizational challenge orchestrated on the fly on multiple tracks: getting the evacuees out and fire crews in, securing the area from looting, and finding temporary homes for the displaced in Lac la Biche, Edmonton and beyond.Preloaded debit cards were being handed out a week after the evacuation.Notley met with oilsands officials to consult and calm concerns about production. She toured the city twice, once with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and afterward received Trudeau\u2019s pledge to expand employment insurance coverage.There was benefit to be derived from the past experiences of major disasters in the province \u2014 a wildfire that destroyed a third of Slave Lake in 2011 and massive flooding that displaced thousands in Calgary and southern Alberta in 2013.\u201cShe\u2019s handled this as well as can be expected,\u201d said Bratt. \u201cHad any of that had gone wrong she would\u2019ve taken the blame, so she gets the credit here as well.\u201dBratt said the evacuation itself was a masterstroke, with more than 80,000 people successfully getting out on the one north-south road out of the city.Notley has also been credited for her work with her political rival, Opposition Leader Brian Jean of the Wildrose party. Jean, who represents Fort McMurray in the legislature member, saw his own home destroyed in the fire.Both Bratt and Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown agree Jean has done an admirable job, pushing Notley and her government on their fire-fighting and reconstruction efforts and on personifying the impact of the disaster.\u201cFor those Albertans that actually don\u2019t know anyone in Fort Mac, they know Brian Jean and they know his story,\u201d said Brown.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take a room in a refugee centre and he wouldn\u2019t take a hotel room. Through it all, he\u2019s still putting his constituents first.\u201dBoth Notley and Jean have been credited for working together in the crisis, but Brown said that will inevitably change as the crisis moves into reimbursement, insurance and rebuilding.\u201cAs difficult as this situation has been, there haven\u2019t been a lot of hard choices,\u201d said Brown. \u201cYou just do what needs to be done.\u201cAs we get further and further along, the choices will get harder. It will be harder to please everybody. It will be harder to know exactly what the right thing to do is.\u201dBratt agreed, saying if evacuees remain out of their homes for extended periods or if aid money doesn\u2019t arrive in timely fashion, opinions will change.There\u2019s also the final financial tally for a province that is already running more than $10 billion in deficit this year.\u201cThe longer this drags out, the more things get complicated,\u201d said Bratt.', u'\u2018The war on STIs has failed\u2019: Reinventing the way we tackle sexual diseaseAmeeta Singh\u2019s patients should know better.The  is seeing more people with more severe sexually transmitted infections \u2014 young men with chlamydia and hemorrhagic proctitis who say they\u2019ve had 30-odd partners in the past six months and didn\u2019t use condoms half the time; seemingly healthy people who\u2019ve been on intensive HIV treatment for ages and\xa0have contracted syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis C from unprotected sex.We\u2019re better at treating, preventing and screening for sexually transmitted infections than ever before. But Canadian communities are seeing historic levels\xa0of syphilis and gonorrhea.Ontario\u2019s had sky-high syphilis rates for so long, it\u2019s what  calls\xa0a \u201cmature epidemic.\u201d  and is increasingly resistant to the only drugs we have to treat it.Last month . The province\u2019s infectious syphilis rates more than doubled between 2014 and 2015 after several years of slow growth \u2014 even as .In Alberta, , the jump in STIs was overwhelmingly among men.Gonorrhea has also increased, albeit not as steeply and with less of a gender disparity.And there\u2019s a significant disparity between .Edmonton has seen by far the biggest increase and highest rates, almost doubling Calgary, which is second-highest.The infectious syphilis rate among men in Edmonton rose the most dramatically \u2014 it more than quadrupled in a single\xa0year:\u201cThe biggest rise in infectious syphilis cases has been among men who have sex with men, although we are seeing cases in heterosexual persons, as well,\u201d Singh said.\u201cThere\u2019ve been a number of reasons put forward to try and explain that rise.\u201dAlberta\u2019s also seeing a spike in STI rates among people 40 years old and up \u2014 what Singh calls their \u201csecond peak\u201d in sexual activity.Between 2011 and 2015, syphilis rates among people aged 40 to 44 increased more than 2,000 per cent.The second-steepest increase was among people 60 and over.Chlamydia rates haven\u2019t increased nearly as much, but they increased the most among people 60 and over:\u201cThere\u2019s a second peak in sexual activity\u201d for people over 40, Singh said.And in this respect, age does not bring wisdom or risk aversion (or an affinity for condom use).Singh also suspects people are having unprotected sex because they\u2019re less afraid of contracting HIV, which has become much easier to treat and, with the advent of \xa0(PrEP), easier to prevent.About a quarter of the infectious syphilis cases in Alberta\xa0are among people who are HIV-positive, Singh said. In Ontario,Or, as Gesink sees it, fear around HIV \u201cdwarfs the other STIs. And you can only stress about so many things before you reach stress fatigue.\u201d, who made a name for himself internationally through his work in , does not buy\xa0the hypothesis that advances in tackling HIV/AIDS have made people have riskier sex.\u201cThe truth is that whenever this issue has been monitored carefully there is no evidence that people change their behaviour as a result of accessing treatment or even pre-exposure prophylaxis.\u201dWe\u2019ve got the causation backwards, Montaner says: If we\u2019re seeing high STI rates among people who are on PrEP, Montaner said, that\u2019s because PrEP is given to people with epidemiologically riskier sex lives.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a circular argument.\u201dThere have always been risks associated with sex and that\u2019s never stopped people from having sex, Montaner said: Lack of contraception doesn\u2019t make people celibate, it just makes it more likely they\u2019ll have an unplanned pregnancy. And while the spectre of a generation decimated by AIDS\xa0horrified people three decades ago, people didn\u2019t stop having sex because there wasn\u2019t yet an effective HIV treatment.\u201cThere is a spectrum: There\xa0are people that are much more reserved in their sexual practices and there are others that are not,\u201d Montaner said.As\xa0a consultant and research in gay men\u2019s health with the , Jody Jollimore\u2019s job is helping people work though\xa0that risk-reward calculus.\u201cThe public health message: get tested more often. Make people feel comfortable enough to talk about their sex to their healthcare provider.\u201dShame and stigma, he noted, \u201cstop people from getting tested.\u201dThe problem is the same as it\u2019s always been, Montaner said: People like having sex. Many would rather have sex without condoms. Health advances have\xa0come up with ways of mitigating the risk of pregnancy and HIV transmission; we\u2019re now up against a host of other diseases.Montaner\u2019s already started looking: He and researchers from the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS have  \u2014 to treat people and lower the likelihood they\u2019re infected again.\u201cHow afraid do you have to be to not jaywalk? \u2026 It just doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he said.\u201cEducation is the better way to go and help people to make better choices, support them in making better choices.\xa0And for those that cannot, will not and are not interested, we need to have a more effective compassionate\xa0approach.\u201d', u'Retired police officers warn Quebec against starting costly gun registryMONTREAL \u2013 Retired Montreal police officer Marc Brisebois remembers always being grateful for any gun-related information that popped up on his screen whenever he was on patrol and called to a house.\u201cIf you have that in front of you, you can take a decision more quickly,\u201d said Brisebois, who retired in 2006 after 30 years on the force.\u201cWe were happy to have that info.\u201dTwenty-one years after the introduction of the federal long-gun registry \u2013 since abolished by the Conservatives \u2013 Quebec is making progress on creating its own database of non-restricted firearms.While Brisebois\u2019 comments reflect the official line from police forces and unions across the country \u2013 especially in Quebec \u2013 not all rank-and file officers agree with him.Some retired cops from across the country are warning Quebec against setting up a registry they say isn\u2019t worth the money and just serves to make citizens feel safer.John, who didn\u2019t want to use his last name, retired from the Montreal police in 2007 after more than 30 years service, many of them spent patrolling downtown.He said it \u201cboggles the mind\u201d that so many millions were spent on the federal registry \u2013 with what he called so few results.When the introduced the registry in 1995, they said it would cost roughly $110 million to create.Instead, the figure ballooned to hundreds of millions of dollars before the Conservatives abolished it in 2012.Quebec said setting up its proper registry will cost $17 million and another $5 million, annually, to maintain.The controversial plan has fuelled reports of dissent within all major parties on the issue.John said smart officers never relied on gun data when answering calls because even if they were told a suspect had no registered firearms, \u201cyou still didn\u2019t know if anyone in that home has a gun.\u201d\u201cIf (the screen) says there is no gun registered to anyone in the house are you going to put your hand in your pocket and your mind on neutral?\u201d he asked rhetorically.Quebec\u2019s police leaders and union bosses argue the registry is essential because officers checked the old database hundreds of times a day.Critics, however, said that while everyone wants safe streets and less violence, there is little evidence a registry makes cities safer.They also argue the millions dedicated to maintaining a gun database can be used more efficiently on crime prevention or increased access to mental-health services.The Ontario Superior Court ruled in 2014 against a constitutional challenge to the Conservative law abolishing the registry, saying \u201cthere is no reliable evidence\u201d the decision \u201cactually has, or will, increase the incidence of violence or death by firearms.\u201dHomicide rates in Canada have been decreasing for years and have fallen in Quebec since the registry was abolished in 2012.A retired officer who worked in Vancouver\u2019s police department for 28 years told The Canadian Press he would \u201cnever rely on the federal government to tell me if there were guns in a house.\u201d\u201cThat is useless information because guns move,\u201d he said.He added that when the registry came online in the 1990s, \u201cit had absolutely no effect on the street and I think you\u2019ll find that most policemen will tell you that if they ran a house address and the operator came back and said there are no guns \u2013 they would take that as a total waste of air.\u201dThe Vancouver officer said police bosses and unions support the registry for political reasons.\u201cA lot of decisions that come down the pipe in police departments are a result of police departments getting funding from politicians,\u201d he said.But Brisebois believes the registry is more than just a tool for law enforcement \u2013 that it\u2019s a symbol of how a society treats firearms and that it reinforces Canada\u2019s cultural differences from those of the United States.\u201cSeeing what the registry did for me \u2013 spend the money,\u201d Brisebois said.\u201cThe important thing is to show people you are doing something [about guns.]\xa0The American way is that guns represent liberty and rights \u2013 do we want this? I don\u2019t. So am I ready to spend that money? Yes.\u201d', u'Trudeau arrives in Japan for G7 summitTOKYO \u2013 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has landed in Tokyo where he will hold a bilateral visit with Japanese leaders before attending the Group of Seven summit later this week.The prime minister touched down early Monday evening local time, accompanied by his wife Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau.Trudeau is expected to\xa0meet Tuesday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the emperor and empress of Japan as well as automotive sector officials.The visit comes ahead of the G7 summit on Thursday and Friday in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.This is Trudeau\u2019s first overseas bilateral visit to Asia since taking office.\xa0He plans to discuss trade, investment, security, education and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xa0', u'Canadian hostage Robert Hall appeals to Filipino government in Abu Sayyaf videoIn a new video released Sunday by terrorist group Abu Sayyaf,\xa0 Canadian Robert Hall called on the Filipino government to help save him and his two fellow hostages before June 13.Hall was kidnapped in the Philippines last September along with Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, a Filipino woman and fellow Canadian John Ridsdel, who was later killed by the terrorist group.The kidnappers had reportedly previously demanded 300 million pesos ($8.1 million) for each of the foreigners.In the video, Hall addresses President-Elect Rodrigo Duterte and says the Filipino government can communicate with his kidnappers through a woman in the Canadian Embassy.\u201cI came into your beautiful country in good faith and in peace and here I am,\u201d Hall says in the video.\u201cWe hope that you can work on our behalf as soon as possible to get us out of here, and please, the sooner the better.\u201dIntelligence group SITE confirmed the video was from Abu Sayyaf, and said the terrorist group is describing it as \u201cthe \u2018final message\u2019 from its three hostages.In the message, Sekkingstad says the deadline for a negotiation is June 13, 3 p.m.Last month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Ridsdel was executed by Abu Sayyaf militants after being held hostage for seven months.At the time, Trudeau said the government is working with international allies to bring the terrorist to justice, but also reiterated its stance of not paying ransoms.\u201cCanada does not and will not pay ransom to terrorists. Directly or indirectly, and there are very direct and clear reasons for this,\u201d Trudeau said.In the end, Hall had a message for his loved ones.\u201cI also would like to thank my family and friends for the effort you put in to get me out of here,\u201d he said. \u201dI know you did everything you can, I truly appreciate it. I\u2019m sorry I got you in this mess.\u201d', u'Boycott over LGBT law impacts more than just the music fansGREENSBORO, N.C. \u2013 Stagehand Kery Eller doesn\u2019t own any Bruce Springsteen albums, but he would smash them if he did.Eller says he expected to earn at least $3,000 working the sold-out Springsteen concert and other high-profile shows around the state before artists cancelled the events in protest over North Carolina\u2019s new LGBT law.Eller and about 100 members of the local union of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees are among the many workers and businesses caught in the crossfire of the national debate over LGBT rights and feeling the economic shockwaves from the growing number of cancelled shows. Hotels, restaurants, bars and even community groups who work arena concession stands say they are suffering from the boycott.\u201cIt\u2019s my livelihood; it\u2019s where I make my money,\u201d Eller said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just hurting the entertainment industry. It\u2019s hurting our state overall, period. And I\u2019m not talking politically at all.\u201dThe wide-reaching law that directs transgender people to use the public bathroom that aligns with the sex on their birth certificate was signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in March. Since then, Pearl Jam, violinist Itzhak Perlman, Ringo Starr and Cirque Du Soleil have cancelled. On Friday, the pop group Maroon 5 became the latest entertainer to decide to skip the state. Other acts performed but donated proceeds from their shows to groups fighting the law.McCrory, who has sued the Justice Department over its directive allowing transgender students to use their preferred bathroom, has continued his support of the law. His campaign issued a statement Friday condemning Maroon 5\u2019s recent cancellation, saying the artists\u2019 boycott only hurts people of North Carolina and arena employees.The last-minute cancellations are disappointing to fans, but more devastating to venue staff, said promoter Gregg McCraw, owner of MaxxMusic in Charlotte.\u201cSpringsteen fired the first shot, and he cancelled that show only two or three days before the show,\u201d McCraw said. \u201cThat had a major impact. The venue clearly couldn\u2019t get anything else in there.\u201dMcCraw said the impact is likely to affect the North Carolina live music industry for months to come because artists and agents are wavering on whether to even schedule shows in North Carolina four to six months from now.\u201cSo there will be a period, and none of us know how long this will last, before something happens in a positive way,\u201d he said.The Greensboro Coliseum Complex, the city\u2019s economic powerhouse, estimated it lost $188,000 from three no-shows so far, according to Ted Oliver, chairman of the advisory board to the complex. The city sent the governor a May 12 letter asking him to reconsider his support of the law.\u201cWhen we hear that the coliseum is suffering, what that really means is the employees are suffering,\u201d Greensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan said. \u201cPeople who work part-time to balance their budget. That affects workers in hotels, housekeeping, front desks. These are people who are dependent on every single paycheque.\u201dFor a large event like Bruce Springsteen, the venue would have hired part-time work from 225 event staff, 60 parking staff, 30 housekeepers and about 100 stagehands, said Andrew Brown, a spokesman for the coliseum complex.Concessions booths staffed by organizations such as the Walter Hines Page High School Band Boosters, who get a cut of the funding for their programs, were left with nothing. They can reap at least $600 a night when the shows are on, which helps them pay to dry clean uniforms and feed the marching band before away games.Band boosters were scheduled to work both Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil, said treasurer Dan Kasper, whose son plays trumpet.Small business owners that share Gate City Blvd with the Coliseum say it\u2019s too early to quantify how much the cancellations have cost them, but the events are usually big business.Badreldin Mustafa, general manager at Tito\u2019s Pizza, said a concert night nearly doubles his business because visitors must walk by to get to the coliseum. Jesus Macias, who owns La Bamba Mexican restaurant, said servers rely on tips from those three or four major events to balance out a dwindling stream of regulars the rest of the year.Owners of some restaurants declined to comment, saying they didn\u2019t want to be entangled in personal and political implications. Both Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte and PNC Arena in Raleigh, which have lost Demi Lovato & Nick Jonas and most recently Maroon 5, declined to comment on the cancellations.Near the Greensboro coliseum, owner and manager Ziad Fleihan of Ghassan\u2019s, a kabob and sandwich shop with a location two blocks from the coliseum, said the potential economic effect is scary.\u201cWe should be making laws that bring business to North Carolina rather than creating barriers keeping people away from the state. The goal of business is to make money,\u201d he said.He is also worried about the NCAA pulling its championship events out of the state. The coliseum and the accompanying Greensboro Aquatic Center are slated to host NCAA basketball tournament games in 2017 and NCAA swimming and diving championship games in 2018. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the NCAA will keep the events in North Carolina.\u201cI think that we can continue to try to get the message out that Greensboro is an inclusive city and not to punish us,\u201d said Vaughan, the Greensboro mayor. \u201cIt really is punishing the city when acts don\u2019t come here and people continue to feel the brunt of that decision.\u201d', u'Clinton calls Trump\u2019s gun policies \u2018dangerous\u2019FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s gun policies are \u201cnot just way out there\u201d but \u201cdangerous\u201d and would make America less safe, Hillary Clinton said Saturday.\u201cThis is someone running to be president of the United States of America \u2013 a country facing a gun violence epidemic \u2013 and he\u2019s talking about more guns in our schools, he\u2019s talking about more hatred and division in our streets,\u201d the likely Democratic presidential nominee said of her presumptive Republican rival. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to keep us safe.\u201dClinton\u2019s criticism of Trump came the day after he slammed her as \u201cHeartless Hillary\u201d for backing restrictions on gun ownership in a speech before the convention of the National Rifle Association, the influential gun rights lobbying group, in Louisville, Kentucky.Clinton spoke at a conference organized by the Trayvon Martin Foundation to help mothers whose children or other relatives have died from shootings. It was led by Sybrina Fulton, whose 17-year-old son, Trayvon Martin, was fatally shot by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012. She has campaigned with Clinton during the Democratic presidential primaries.\u201cThe reason why I stand with her is because she first stood with me,\u201d Fulton said before introducing Clinton to more than 200 people packed inside a hotel banquet room.Queen Thompson Brown, a Miami mother whose son was the victim of gun violence in 2006 and who has mentored Fulton, said she and others do not want to take away guns from Americans but hope to \u201cpromote common sense gun laws.\u201dClinton praised the courage of Fulton and others who had suffered the loss of loved ones to gun violence or while in police custody.\u201cWe have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what zip code they live in,\u201d she said.She then turned her attention to Trump and his gun policies.\u201cIf you want to imagine what Trump\u2019s America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry, picture more anger and fear,\u201d she said.Clinton repeated her pledge to fight the powerful National Rifle Association lobby, saying \u201cwe will not be silenced, we will not be intimidated.\u201dThe gun rights organization endorsed Trump, even though he had previously supported measures like an assault weapons ban that the NRA vigorously opposes. The group applauded Trump\u2019s call for ending \u201cgun-free zones\u201d across the country.', u'Unpacking the Politics of Trudeau\u2019s \u2018Elbowgate\u2019The prime minister\xa0\u201cfouled the legislature\u201d by physically intervening in an NDP blockade in the House of Commons last week, says one veteran Hill journalist, and the story isn\u2019t going to be going away anytime soon.Sun Media\u2019s David Akin had some choice words for Justin Trudeau on this week\u2019s edition of The West Block as he and Kristy Kirkup of the Canadian Press discussed what has now become known as \u201celbowgate.\u201d\u201c\u2018Get the \u2018f\u2019 out of the way\u2019 is not something a prime minister should say on the floor of the House of Commons,\u201d said Akin, referring to Trudeau\u2019s alleged language as he attempted to pull Conservative whip Gordon Brown to the front of the House to start a vote.Kirkup said that in a recent conversation\xa0with the NDP\u2019s Ruth-Ellen Brosseau, who was accidentally elbowed by Trudeau during the fracas, she got the sense that the Quebec MP just wants the whole thing to blow over.\u201cShe says it\u2019s worse for her on a personal level than it was in 2011 \u2026 you\u2019ll remember that she garnered headlines because she took a famous trip to Las Vegas during the course of the campaign.\u201dAkin said that regardless of what Brosseau or Trudeau wants, this story isn\u2019t nearly over. A Commons committee is expected to\xa0examine the incident.\u201cThis story\u2019s going to work through some cycles,\u201d he said.', u'Will Canadian doctors grant assisted death without a new law?Canadian doctors and nurses are going to find themselves in a \u201cvery difficult situation\u201d come June 6 if the government doesn\u2019t manage to pass new legislation on assisted dying, says the vice-president\xa0of the Canadian Medical Association.Dr. Jeff Blackmer says his members are extremely concerned about the lack of clear direction that could occur if patients start asking for help to die before a law is in place.The Supreme Court has ruled that as of June 6, medically assisted dying will no longer be illegal in Canada. Patients can ask for it, doctors and nurses can provide it.But without a federal law in place, the only guidance available on the procedure would come from the Supreme Court decision itself. And it\u2019s far from clear, Blackmer told the West Block\u2019s Tom Clark.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe  also contains no outline for the\xa0process that a doctor would follow in terms of determining whether or not someone would qualify, and there\u2019s no reporting requirement. A medical professional could technically help end a patient\u2019s life, then\xa0tell no one.\u201cSo you can imagine for the average physician being faced with this type of a scenario, they will not want to participate because they will not feel at all comfortable in terms of the legal status of their activities or the extent to which they will be protected legally as well,\u201d Blackmer said.Even with a law in place, access to assisted death may be tricky. Only 29 per cent of doctors surveyed by the Canadian Medical Association said they were comfortable with helping someone\xa0die if that patient is terminally ill. For someone who isn\u2019t terminal, the percentage of doctors willing to participate drops to 19 per cent.\u201cI anticipate that if we were talking about things like someone whose sole diagnosis is mental illness that would go down further,\u201d Blackmer said.', u'WATCH: Larry David appears as Bernie Sanders on SNL before Democratic primary wraps upFor the last time this season, Saturday Night Live brought Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders together on the small screen. In the opening skit of the show, Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, ready to depart from a local California bar as it closes up finds a straggling Sanders, played by Larry David, unwilling to leave.\u201cNo freaking way\u201d yells Sanders when told by the bartender that he has to leave. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I can stay here as long as I want.\u201dIn the SNL skit, the two democratic rivals share a drink together before leaving trading jabs, reminiscent of their situation in the Democratic primaries.Sanders orders a beer that\u2019s \u201ca new brand that people are flocking to, something refreshing, revolutionary, something that draws Yuge crowds\u201d and Clinton opts for a brand \u201cno one likes but gets the job done.\u201dBoth candidates lambaste the Democratic primary process they endured as they call the system \u201crigged\u201d before giving cheers to Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.As the night wraps up, Clinton and Sanders have one last dance before leaving with Sanders declaring \u201cI\u2019ll lead,\u201d which Clinton replies \u201cnever.\u201dThey dance through the SNL studio before Clinton spins Sanders into an elevator and promptly presses the button to close the doors.', u'Assisted-death deadline looms in the SenateFifteen\xa0days.That\u2019s how long the government of Canada now has to legislate medically-assisted dying before seeking medical help to end your life is no longer illegal in Canada.The House of Commons still hasn\u2019t voted on the bill, a situation that\xa0has some senators very nervous. By the time they get their hands on it (probably on May 31), there won\u2019t be enough time to examine it properly, amend it, and get it back to the House, according to Conservative Sen. Don Plett.He estimated that the Senate would have a little over 48 hours to do its work in order to meet\xa0the June 6 deadline set by the Supreme Court of Canada.\u201cTo rush that through in two days would clearly not be what the chamber of sober second thought should be doing.\u201d\xa0Senator Peter Harder, the government\u2019s representative in the Senate, has been\xa0tasked with shepherding the bill through the Senate. He told Clark that he won\u2019t intervene with any procedural tricks to move things along faster in the upper chamber.\u201cI\u2019ve had very constructive conversations with the leadership of the Senate and we\u2019re looking at how we can map out a deliberative and productive pacing to the Senate work.\u201d\xa0Harder explained that the Senate is already considering a motion to extend its sitting hours to midnight to allow for more debate and a quicker resolution. There may be amendments to the bill before it heads back to the House for a final vote.', u'Trump more than happy to agree Sanders is getting a raw dealWASHINGTON \u2013 Bernie Sanders is winning sympathy from an unlikely ally: Donald Trump.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is seizing on Sanders\u2019 refrain that the Democratic Party is stacked against him, shutting out his supporters and rigging the rules to favour Hillary Clinton.In rallies, tweets and interviews, Trump has made Sanders\u2019 plight a frequent talking point.\u201cBernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats \u2013 the system is rigged against him,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday. \u201cMany of his disenfranchised fans are for me!\u201d This followed Sanders\u2019 victory in the Oregon primary, with a Kentucky contest too close to call.As Trump tries to make common cause with Sanders backers attacking their own party, Sanders\u2019 path to the nomination has narrowed to the nearly impossible and campaign donations have plummeted. He\u2019s putting forward a long list of grievances with the Democratic Party as the reason for his declining fortunes. And he\u2019s threatening that unless the system is changed, Republicans \u2013 like Trump \u2013 will win over working-class voters.The central target of his ire: Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\u201cWe can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz, just about how she\u2019s been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN.Schultz aside, Clinton has won over broad majorities of minority and female voters, giving her the lead not only in delegates but in the popular vote. But that reality hasn\u2019t swayed Sanders, whose heavy emphasis on party functionaries and arcane political rules is a notable change for a candidate who\u2019s long focused on curbing income inequality, regulating Wall Street and eradicating the influence of corporate money in politics.\t\t\t\n\t\tSanders and Trump have both seen themselves as victims of a system stacked against them by the establishment. It\u2019s a complaint Trump has put behind him now that he\u2019s vanquished his rivals and come within reach of a nomination-clinching delegate majority. But Sanders and his supporters are simmering, if not boiling over, with that grievance now.\u201cI\u2019ve been receiving phone calls from all over the U.S. \u2013 profane, sexist, they threatened my life, they\u2019ve threatened my family,\u201d said Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange. \u201cI feel threatened everywhere I go.\u201dThose protests, though, are rooted in rules that were set months, if not years, ago \u2013 long before Trump and Sanders caught fire with the independents and first-time voters who\u2019ve fueled their rise. Both were tripped up by Byzantine party statutes that govern how nominees are chosen.When Trump saw Ted Cruz begin to outmanoeuvr him in the hunt for delegates, Trump started railing against a \u201crigged\u201d and \u201ccrooked\u201d electoral system that he said favoured the will of party bosses over millions of Republican voters. And Trump frequently linked his fate with that of Sanders, expressing disbelief that Sanders could win one primary after the next and still be losing to Clinton.While the Republican system\u2019s rigging was more \u201csophisticated,\u201d he said, the Democrats\u2019 system was just as bad, because of its use of hundreds of superdelegates \u2013 the party insiders who can declare their support for any candidate regardless of who wins primary contests.In Nevada, chair throwing, shouted profanities and even death threats to party leaders marked a meeting of the state party on Saturday. Sanders supporters accused Lange of stacking the rules against them. But those rules were approved by the state party\u2019s full board weeks ago, party officials said.Clinton backers say the Sanders supporters simply do not understand the process.\u201cI cannot see anything that\u2019s within the jurisdiction of the rules committee that has any impact on who\u2019s the nominee,\u201d said former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, a Clinton backer charged by the DNC with heading up the convention rules committee. \u201cHe just got mad at me because some of the criticism that I\u2019ve made of his legislative record.\u201dBut Weaver said on MSNBC on Wednesday that \u201cclear structural impediments\u201d block the rise of insurgent candidates like Sanders and prevent new voters from joining the party.\t\t\t\n\t\tSanders says he will fight hard to defeat Trump, whether or not he captures his party\u2019s nomination.Clinton, who is on a firm path to clinching the nomination within weeks, faces the prospect of winning back Sanders supporters, many of whom are feeling increasingly alienated.That hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by Trump. His campaign sees winning over angry Sanders supporters and other disenchanted Democrats \u2013 particularly in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio \u2013 as key to victory.In recent days, Trump has begun to suggest that Sanders should mount a third-party campaign. \u201cHe should run as an independent!\u201d tweeted Trump on Monday. \u201cRun Bernie, run.\u201dThe idea is not rooted in sympathy, though, but in Trump\u2019s conviction that such an independent effort would siphon votes from Clinton in the fall and help make him president.', u'New research raises questions about Liberal plans to change parental leaveOTTAWA \u2013 New research shows Canada\u2019s parental leave program leaves out two-fifths of mothers, many of them low-income, and points to a stark divide between families that are \u201cparental-leave-rich\u201d and \u201cparental-leave-poor\u201d \u2013 just as the Liberals prepare to enhance the program.A study of federal parental leave figures published this week finds that about 41 per cent of mothers outside of Quebec don\u2019t qualify for benefits because they don\u2019t have enough insurable hours.In Quebec, which has its own maternity and paternity leave program, less than 11 per cent didn\u2019t qualify.Those numbers don\u2019t include mothers in Canada\u2019s three territories or in First Nations communities, which means the number of mothers who don\u2019t qualify could be even higher.There was also an economic divide: More than 65 per cent of women earning over $30,000 qualified for the benefit in 2013, while that number was about 37 per cent for women earning under that amount.The results of the study, published Thursday in the Journal of Industrial Relations, raises questions about the Liberal plan for a revamped parental leave program, and whether the party\u2019s promise to extend leave to 18 months will just exacerbate the situation.During the election, the Liberals promised to allow new parents to take up to 18 months of leave after a child is born and also give parents the option of spreading 12 months of benefits into chunks over the extended time period.Labour Minister MaryAnn Mihychuk has also said she is interested in creating dedicated leave for new fathers, similar to what is in place in Quebec, and will put the idea to Canadians in yet-to-be-launched consultations.The lead author on the study said the government has already been warned that its plan could leave out almost half the children in the country unless it eases eligibility rules so more mothers, especially low-income earners, can qualify.\u201cYou\u2019re going in a direction of making yourself look good by doing something for middle-class parents, but you\u2019re not addressing what is the actual problem with parental leave,\u201d said Lindsey McKay, a post-doctoral fellow and adjunct professor at Brock University\u2019s school of sociology.For now, the federal parental leave program pays out benefits for up to 15 weeks for new mothers and allows mothers and fathers to split an additional 35 weeks.The federal program requires parents to have worked at least 600 hours in the year before they go on leave, unlike in Quebec where the threshold is $2,000 of earnings. That difference has meant that Quebec over time has seen an increase in the number of low-income women qualifying for the benefit \u2013 boosting national numbers to give a rosier picture of parental leave in Canada.The 600-hour requirement in the rest of Canada has had the opposite effect as fewer women over time have qualified for leave. The percentage of women not qualifying has gone up since the mid-1990s when the hours required stood at 300. Even though in some cases they have contributed to employment insurance for years, they may not have enough hours to qualify because they work part-time, or they are students.Changing those requirements to be in line with Quebec\u2019s standard would allow more mothers to stay at home during the first year of their child\u2019s life, McKay said.\u201cThe children are kind of penalized for the employment situation of the parent at the time of their birth,\u201d said McKay, who herself didn\u2019t qualify for the benefit four years ago after giving birth to twins because she was a student.\u201cWhat it means is that we have a vast majority of people contributing to the program, but the people who are benefiting are those who are in higher income households.\u201d', u'Here\u2019s what you missed this week at Parliament when talking about \u2018Elbowgate\u2019OTTAWA \u2013 Parliament Hill was either seething with animosity or awash in contrition for most of this extraordinary week, with the opposition and the government manoeuvring \u2014  \u2014 to get the better of one other.The Trudeau government apologized no fewer than six times over a 24-hour period for transgressions past and present, and had to walk back a contentious proposal to impose stricter controls over debate in the House of Commons.The drama managed to drown out or throw off course several other developments that affect everyday lives.Here are three other developments in practical politics this week that will touch Canadians after the din of \u201cElbowgate\u201d dies down.The law that would allow some Canadians access to medically assisted death has been knocked about by politics yet again.First, serious discussion was delayed by last year\u2019s federal election. Then, the new government took time to set up a committee and consult, asking the court for an extension to comply with its order to allow access. Ottawa now has until June 6.Then this week, the schedule was jostled again \u2014 this time by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s collision with NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau on the floor of the House of Commons prior to a vote to shut down debate on the bill.The bill was already in trouble before Trudeau\u2019s controversial and ill-considered decision to expedite matters by dragging Conservative whip Gord Brown through a crowd of mischief-making New Democrats, which included Brosseau.An Alberta Court of Appeal decision this week took direct aim at the government\u2019s rationale, saying the government should not restrict assisted dying only to those near death. The court also said the government can\u2019t exclude people suffering solely from psychiatric conditions.The ruling gave pause to many MPs, who have already been told they will be able to vote their conscience when the time comes.The Senate has also made it clear it may not pass the bill unless it allows advanced directives from those with dementia or other competence-eroding conditions. Regardless, there\u2019s little chance the bill will pass before June 6.Even as MPs hollered at each other inside the House, Sikhs from across Canada descended on Parliament Hill to hear the prime minister apologize for sending the steamship  back to India some 102 years ago.Their presence and the apology\u2019s prominence were a striking reminder of how diaspora politics have been pushing and pulling the fabric of Canada for more than a century.\t\t\t\n\t\tSouth Asians are now the largest visible minority in Canada, and 17 Sikh MPs were elected last fall. Wooing blocks of ethnic voters has become central to election strategy for all parties.Indeed, the day before the Komagata Maru apology, an official in Christy Clark\u2019s B.C. government was charged with criminal breach of trust for his alleged role in an ethnic vote-getting scandal that included efforts to make public apologies for historic wrongs in multicultural communities.The dynamic of diasporas in Canadian politics is not always black and white, however. As Conservative MP Michael Chong launched his bid for the party leadership this week, he pronounced himself in favour of the party\u2019s long-standing policy against niqabs and face-coverings at citizenship ceremonies \u2014 even though the Conservative stand on niqabs may have cost the party heavily in the last election.With little fanfare, the government opted to let Canadians . Health Canada this week approved the first genetically modified animal to be produced for human consumption: an Atlantic salmon, modified to grow twice as fast by using genes from Chinook salmon.The government says the fish are safe and nutritious, but that\u2019s not the end of the matter. Critics say there is a risk to introducing what amounts to a new species to the environment, and want, as a bare minimum, to see the fish labelled \u2014 a practice the government has resisted for GM foods but now says it will study.For now, AquaBounty Technologies Inc. will produce the modified eggs in its facility in Prince Edward Island, grow the eggs into full-size fish in Panama and then ship them back to Canada for consumption.', u'Family of Alberta woman granted assisted death speaks outThe family of an Alberta woman suffering from a mental condition is thanking the courts for granting her a doctor-assisted death.The woman, known in court documents as E.F., has severe conversion disorder, which has left her effectively blind, unable to eat and in constant pain.A Court of Queen\u2019s Bench judge allowed her an assisted death earlier this month and the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the decision this week.In a written statement, the family said it hopes the federal government will follow the ruling.\u201cWe thank Madam Justice Bast as well as the Court of Appeal of Alberta for honouring her wish,\u201d said the statement, released Friday by the woman\u2019s lawyer.The Appeal Court ruling criticized the federal government\u2019s proposed legislation on assisted death. The court said the bill doesn\u2019t comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision as it excludes people suffering solely from psychiatric conditions.The appeal judges also said the government shouldn\u2019t restrict assisted dying only to those near death.The top court has given the federal government until June 6 to come up with a new law but it\u2019s unlikely Bill C-14 will pass before the deadline.Legal experts believe that in the absence of a new law, the Supreme Court ruling will become the law of the land. Advocates say the practice would likely end up being regulated by professional medical colleges.E.F.\u2019s family said her mind is sharp and she knows what\u2019s going on in the news.The statement describes how the 58-year-old woman has lived in agony for the last eight years.\u201cIt began with an intense pain on her left side and then spread relentlessly, savage like wildfire, over her entire body. She says it feels like she\u2019s under a constant barrage of arrows from an archer\u2019s bow. Her searing migraines are nightmares from which she cannot wake.\u201dSevere conversion disorder is a psychiatric condition that results in physical problems. The Appeal Court ruling said involuntary muscle spasms in E.F.\u2019s body have left her virtually blind and in constant pain.\u201cThe pain makes it impossible for her to sleep without the help of strong medication. She cannot speak more than few words without gasping from the pain.\u201dThe woman feels like a prisoner in her own body, the family said.\u201cShe has lost hope that a cure for her condition exists, and for at least two years, she has asked to be put to rest.\u201dThe family did not say when E.F. plans to die but asked for privacy in \u201cour last precious days together.\u201dThe court ruling said the doctor who is to assist E.F. in her death is from British Columbia.', u'73% of Canadians want national referendum on electoral reform, poll suggestsAs Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government took\xa0\xa0in overhauling the country\u2019s electoral system, a new poll suggests nearly three-quarters of Canadians say any changes should be put to a national referendum.The poll, conducted exclusively for Global News by Ipsos Public Affairs, found 73 per cent of respondents \u201cagree\u201d (37 per cent strongly/36 per cent somewhat) that the Liberals shouldn\u2019t make any changes to the country\u2019s voting system without a national referendum first.\u201cIt seems that there is a consensus view that if we\u2019re going to make major changes it probably needs to go to a referendum,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos.While every province was in agreement on the referendum issue, Albertans (80 per cent) were most likely to agree to a referendum. Quebec was the least likely to agree with 62 per cent.Seventy-six per cent of B.C. and Ontario residents agreed with the statement, while 75 per cent of those surveyed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were in agreement. Atlantic Canada residents reflected the national average at 73 per cent.\u201cThere is a lot of public support for a [referendum], so you would have to have a pretty compelling reason not to have one,\u201d said Bricker.Conservative MP Scott Reid said the results of the poll reflect Canadian values that have been held since the 1992\xa0Charlottetown Accord.\u201cCanadians since that time have simply accepted and deeply internalized the belief that no fundamental change should occur\xa0to our political system without the approval of the Canadian people.\u201d\u200eDuring the 2015 federal election, the Liberals pledged it would be the last under the first-past-the-post system after securing a majority government with 39.5 per cent of the popular vote, roughly the same share of the popular vote as Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives received in 2011.Critics of the first-past-the-post system say it silences the voices of millions of voters because it ignores everyone who didn\u2019t vote for the winner in their riding.When it comes to referendums, Canada has had only . However provinces like British Columbia and Prince Edward Island in 2005, and Ontario in 2007 have held referendums on whether to change their voting systems, and in each case opted to keep the status quo.Last week, Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef unveiled the long-awaited special all-party committee on electoral reform that will how make recommendations on how the voting system might be changed (to preferential ballots or proportional representation, for example).The Conservatives have consistently said electoral reform should not proceed without a referendum.\u201cWhen it comes to changing the way we vote now more than ever Canadians need to have the final say,\u201d Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer said in the House of Commons Friday, before calling on Monsef to commit to holding a referendum.In response, Monsef said the government \u201cwill go out of our way to ensure Canadians have the first and final say in how we conduct our electoral reform.\u201dLast Thursday, Monsef argued in the House that by consulting Canadians using a variety of methods, including town hall meetings over the next few months and online tools like social media, the government will be able to gain insight from \u201cthose who aren\u2019t normally included in this conversation.\u201dNDP MP Nathan Cullen told  the Liberals should have created a more balanced committee as they hold 60 per cent of the seats, but looks forward to working with all parties on the issue.The poll found 52 per cent of Canadians \u201cdisagree\u201d (15% strongly/37% somewhat) that \u201cCanada\u2019s election system works fine as it is\u201d while 48 per cent agree (16% strongly/32% somewhat) that the current system works well.\u201cInterestingly enough the places where they are divided on whether or not we need to do anything are the places that were among the least likely to vote for the Liberals, like Alberta for example,\u201d said Bricker.Global News reached out to the NDP for comment but did not get a response at the time of publication and we will update this story if they respond. The Liberal Party refused to comment on the poll.', u'\u2018Free the beer!\u2019 demands Conservative MP in last Question Period before long weekendIn a display of statesmanship fit for any beer hall or backyard barbecue across the land, Conservative MP Dan Albas stood before the House of Commons Friday and once again called upon the government to end the prohibition on transporting alcohol across provincial borders. \u201cFree the beer!\u201d shouted Albas, much to the delight of colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great on the eve of a long weekend,\u201d said Albas. \u201cWe could all kick back and share a fine Canadian beverage together.\u201cPerhaps a B.C. red wine, or a Nova Scotia white, maybe a Saskatchewan craft ale,\u201d said Albas.\u201cBut wait, here in Ontario it\u2019s still illegal to directly ship these Canadian products,\u201d he added.Albas\u2019 renewed call to action stems from a New Brunswick court ruling early this month in which Justice Robert LeBlanc declared a provincial ban on transporting alcohol between provinces violates the constitution.Shouts of \u201cOh no!\u201d and \u201cSay it isn\u2019t so!\u201d could be heard from fellow MPs as Albas pushed the government to move quickly on this issue.\u201cWhen will the Liberal government give Canadians a reason to raise their glasses?\u201d asked Albas.Greg Fergus, parliamentary secretary to the minister of innovation, science and economic development, responded to Albas\u2019 question by inviting him sit down and share a beer.\u201cHe has the time, I have the beer. Let\u2019s get together,\u201d said Fergus, adding that the government continues to seek a comprehensive trade deal between Ottawa and the provinces.Economic development minister Navdeep Bains has also indicated that he welcomes the N.B. court ruling, and that he will work with both provincial and territorial counterparts to bring about the end of internal trade barriers and tariffs.No news yet on whether Albas has accepted Fergus\u2019 offer to join him for a beer.', u'NRA endorses Donald Trump for president of the United StatesLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 The National Rifle Association is endorsing  for president.Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA\u2019s political arm, announced the endorsement ahead of Trump\u2019s appearance at the group\u2019s convention. Trump called the endorsement a \u201cfantastic honor\u201d and said he would not let NRA members down.Cox focused most of his remarks on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, calling her a threat to gun owners. He says that with the next president likely to having a Supreme Court vacancy to fill, \u201cThe Second Amendment is on the ballot this November.\u201dCox also appealed to NRA members who may have preferred other candidates to Trump. He says, \u201cit\u2019s time to get over it.\u201d', u'Crisis pregnancy centres mislead women, report saysJane was pregnant and she didn\u2019t want to be. She didn\u2019t know\xa0where to go.She was pursuing a graduate degree in Kamloops, B.C., studying for exams last spring when she\xa0discovered she was pregnant.Kamloops has no abortion provider. But Jane did find \xa0\u2014 it promised \u201cconfidential, compassionate assistance and support\u201d for someone facing an unplanned pregnancy and unsure of her options.That assistance didn\u2019t include referrals to abortion providers, or information about getting an abortion.\u201cIt was kind of astounding: There\u2019s no official abortion clinic in Kamloops, however the crisis pregnancy centre did receive\xa0,\u201d she said.She took a pass.The clinic\u2019s executive director Shirley Bosman said in \xa0the centre is \u201cabsolutely\u201d clear up front about its stance on abortion.\u201cWe provide medically factual information\xa0regarding all options available to women, including abortion, adoption and parenting. All Kamloops abortions are\xa0performed at the hospital and require a physician referral,\u201d Bosman wrote.\u201cEvery decision that a woman makes regarding her\xa0unplanned pregnancy is a lifetime decision, whether to abort, parent or place for adoption. . \u2026 It is important that she\xa0is offered the opportunity to explore all her options and be assured that her decision is respected.\u201d\xa0argues the hundreds of crisis pregnancy centres in Canada offer misleading\xa0online advertising that bills them as something they\u2019re not.They style themselves as open, unbiased places where unexpectedly pregnant people can explore their options, the study says, while saying\xa0or implying\xa0that one of those options is a bad idea.Misinformation can make it tough or impossible for people to get the care they need in a timely manner. You only have so many weeks to decide whether you want to terminate a pregnancy.But it can also cement the idea that abortion is a horrible thing no one should talk about, says\xa0.The  reviewed websites for 166 different crisis pregnancy centres across Canada. It argues they\u2019re \u201cdeceptive\u201d in their marketing, \u201cpromote misinformation\u201d\xa0and should be regulated.Sixty per cent of the websites didn\u2019t mention that the centre in question\xa0won\u2019t refer people to abortion providers; 5 per cent claim there\u2019s a link between abortion and breast cancer.Just under half (48 per cent) mentioned negative psychological consequences of terminating a pregnancy, a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder often\xa0referred to as \u201cpost-abortion syndrome,\u201d \u201cwhich is not a medically recognized condition,\u201d the study says.More than two-thirds (68 per cent) of the centres studied are registered charities, the report says.\xa0There are . Many also get direct government funding.\u201cA registered charity must ensure that each health care service or product it provides meets applicable requirements relating to , and ,\u201d Canada Revenue Agency spokesperson David Walters wrote in an email Friday.\u201cWhere a charity furthers a promotion of health purpose through the provision of health information to the public, the information provided must be reasonably unbiased, factual and sufficiently detailed.

Mike Duffy, prosecutors made it official Friday that Harb, 62, would not face a criminal trial because the Crown did not see a reasonable prospect of conviction.The charges stemmed from living expenses Harb, a one-time Liberal MP from Ottawa, filed for a secondary home in the city while claiming his primary residence was far from the national capital.A Senate audit raised doubts about the veracity of his claims and Harb ended up repaying the Senate about $231,000 in housing expenses going back years.Harb, who retired from the Senate three years ago, had been set to face a criminal trial later this year.In a statement, Harb\u2019s lawyer Sean May said his client has \u201csteadfastly maintained his innocence throughout the arduous process\u201d of the RCMP investigation, one in which he co-operated fully.\u201cThe withdrawal of the charges is a complete vindication of Mr. Harb, legally and ethically,\u201d May said.Last month, the 31 expense-related criminal charges Duffy had been facing were dismissed in sensational fashion by an Ottawa judge, including counts of fraud, breach of trust and bribery.And on Thursday, the RCMP abruptly announced that it wouldn\u2019t pursue charges against Sen. Pamela Wallin, closing her file after three years of poring through her travel expenses.Friday\u2019s decision makes it clear that investigators and the Crown have been reconsidering their options since the Duffy verdict.The decision on Harb\u2019s case leaves only one senator still facing a trial: Conservative appointee Patrick Brazeau, who is \u2013 for the moment, at least \u2013 scheduled to face trial next year on charges of fraud and breach of trust.Harb entered politics as an Ottawa alderman in 1985. He served as deputy mayor before making the leap to federal politics in 1988 as the member of Parliament for Ottawa Centre. He held that seat through four consecutive federal elections.In 1994, Harb was appointed parliamentary secretary for international trade. He was named to the Senate in September 2003 by then-prime minister Jean Chretien.In early 2013, the Senate began taking a closer look at the living expenses of Harb, Duffy and Brazeau amid concerns that all three, who lived in or close to Ottawa, were improperly charging the Senate for housing allowances.Senate rules allow senators to claim expenses for two homes if their primary residence is more than 100 kilometres from Parliament Hill. Harb claimed his primary residence was in a home just beyond that limit, qualifying for the annual subsidy of about $20,000 for his years in the Senate.The Senate committee charged with oversight of spending ordered outside auditors from Deloitte to review the trio\u2019s spending.For Harb and Brazeau, the auditors argued the spending rules were unclear, making it difficult to tell if they\u2019d been broken. That same refrain would be echoed by the company that audited the Senate\u2019s financial statements and from witnesses at Duffy\u2019s criminal trial.Even before Harb\u2019s trial, his lawyer had publicly suggested those findings that the rules were unclearHarb\u2019s audit suggested he didn\u2019t spend a lot of time at his primary residence outside the city, even though that wasn\u2019t part of the rules, and senators decided that was enough to order him to pay back the money.An RCMP investigation into Harb\u2019s spending made sweeping allegations that Harb\u2019s primary residence was allegedly \u201cuninhabitable\u201d for three years, and that he maintained a 0.01 per cent ownership stake in the house after selling the rest to a diplomat from Brunei who subsequently left Canada.But the Mounties said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to charge Harb with mortgage fraud when they laid the fraud and breach of trust charges in February 2014.', u'Doctors worry assisted death will become legal without a lawAssisted death may be legal in Canada before the country has a legal framework governing it \u2014 and that worries the people who\u2019ll have to decide who gets help dying.The federal Liberals are rushing to pass Bill C-14, which outlines who is eligible for assisted death, who can provide it and how these deaths get recorded. But even though they\u2019ve cut short debate, it has yet to pass the House of Commons.Next week is a break week, which means the earliest C-14 could pass the House is Monday, May 30. That leaves barely a week for it to pass\xa0an independent-minded Senate and then get royal assent before Canada\u2019s prohibition on physician-assisted death expires.\u201cThere\u2019s already a lot of anxiety in the medical profession about this,\u201d says Jeff Blackmer, the Canadian Medical Association\u2019s\xa0vice president of medical professionalism.\u201cThere is an importance in having legislation in place by that June 6 deadline.\u201dMany doctors will probably refuse to provide assisted death at all until a federal law is in place, Blackmer said.\u201cIf June 6 comes and goes and there\u2019s no federal legislation and no clear guidance in terms of what\u2019s expected from physicians, what the process to be followed is, what the legal protections are. We\u2019re anticipating a lot of physicians will\xa0probably\xa0take a bit of a wait-and-see attitude until they have clarity on some of that.\u201dThere will never be a \u201cperfect\u201d assisted death law, Blackmer said, but Bill C-14 at least offers a necessary starting point.\u201cAbsent that clarity, there will essentially be no agreement on what process should be followed,\u201d he said.Bill C-14 allows those suffering \u201ca grievous and irremediable medical condition\u201d to ask for help ending their life from either a doctor or a nurse practitioner. It will\xa0l,\xa0Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott has said.Medical professionals\xa0will have the right to opt out of providing such care.If there\u2019s no new law,. Some things are clear: Competent, consenting adults suffering grievous and irremediable conditions are eligible for assisted death. The court\u2019s decision only mentions physicians, so nurse practitioners would probably be excluded.Pharmacists might be in a trickier legal position, however: The Carter ruling doesn\u2019t mention them. But someone will have\xa0to dispense the lethal medication as required.Liberal House Leader Dominic\xa0LeBlanc says the government remains committed to getting the bill passed by the court\u2019s deadline.But\xa0NDP justice critic Murray Rankin says he doesn\u2019t see how that will be possible.Blackmer said come June 7, regardless of legislation doctors may be presented with an influx of patients who have been waiting to come forward with requests.\u201cIf you\u2019re a doctor and there\u2019s no law to guide you\u2026you\u2019re going to be very reluctant to put yourself on the line.\u201d', u'NB Right to Life Association includes assisted death at pro-life rallyA traditionally pro-life protest extended its focus to include  in light of federal legislation, but still saw the same push-back from abortion activists as they have in the past.The New Brunswick Right to Life Association\u2019s March for Life is an annual event which takes place outside the provincial legislature.Recent  have caught the ire of the group, who typically holds their rally in support of pro-life.\u201cWe have to be able to protect vulnerable people.\u201dSimilar to years past, pro-choice supporters protested the rally, holding signs and chanting throughout the majority of the event.\u201cIt\u2019s about the fact that people need to have reproductive rights and they need to have access to those,\u201d said Abbie Moser, organizer of the pro-choice protest.Those protesting the rally say abortions aren\u2019t as accessible as they would like, as only a couple areas in the province provide the service. They say talking about it is the only way to see that change.\u201cWe still don\u2019t have access,\u201d said\xa0Moser. \xa0\u201cIt\u2019s still something that we need and a lot of people don\u2019t remember that.\u201dRight to Life maintains this year\u2019s event was centred around physician assisted death and not abortion, and that a quick turn around after the Supreme Court ruling kept them from updating their wares.', u'Tax credit to offer incentive to NS farmers donating produce to food banksRustic wooden crates filled with apples and onions and baskets overflowing with fresh produce graced the Feed Nova Scotia warehouse in Bedford, Nova Scotia Thursday.They were donated by various local farmers upon the announcement of the impending approval of the new provincial The credit, which has been in the works for a few years, is aimed at providing greater tax relief to farmers who donate surplus produce to food banks.Food banks will be able to issue a tax receipt to farmers that is equal to 25 per cent of the value of the donation received. Donations will also remain eligible for the Charitable Donation Tax Credit.Chris van den Heuvel, president of the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture, says the tax credit will not only benefit farmers, but it will also help the food banks meet an .On average, nearly 44,000 Nova Scotians visit a food bank at least once during the year.Agriculture Minister Keith Colwell commended the new tax credit for its support of farmers who have continually made large contributions to food banks through the years.\u201cThis is fantastic news for Nova Scotia, it\u2019s fantastic news for the farmers of the province that have donated so much food to the food bank for such a long time. But most importantly, it\u2019s important to the people in the community that need to come to the food bank,\u201d he said.According to van den Heuvel, in the past year Nova Scotia\u2019s farmers donated over 149,000 kilograms of produce to food banks.Nick Jennery, the executive director of Feed Nova Scotia, sees this tax credit as a means to help people give back to their community.Once the credit is approved, it can be applied to any donations made by farmers from January 1, 2016 onward.Colwell says the details of the tax credit are in the process of being approved, and once finalized the credit would be implemented in a few days.', u'\u2018I\u2019ll smack your chops\u2019: A history of Canadian politicians behaving badlyCanadian parliamentarians tend to fight more with words than with fists.But coming to blows is not exactly unheard of.As MPs denounced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s actions in the House of Commons Wednesday, when he grabbed one MP and bumped another with his elbow, it\u2019s worth remembering some other times the House of Commons got rowdy.Trudeau himself has had a bit of a temper in the past. He once called then-Environment Minister Peter Kent a \u201cpiece of s\u2013t\u201d during Question Period in 2011. He  minutes later, saying that he had lost his temper.Conservative Peter Van Loan got up in NDP MP Nathan Cullen\u2019s face in 2012, crossing the floor of the House of Commons, waving his finger and according to New Democrats, swearing at Cullen. Other NDP MPs, including Tom Mulcair, stood up in Cullen\u2019s defence.  that according to Conservatives, Mulcair swore right back.The fight was broken up before it came to any physical blows.When called a racist by a Liberal MP in 1997, Reform MP Darrel Stinson .Liberal MP John Cannis didn\u2019t take him up on the offer.Sometimes politicians do get physical though: in 1987, Conservative MP Dan McKenzie shoved Liberal John Nunziata during a late-night debate on a back-to-work bill for postal workers.According to an article by the Canadian Press, dug up by the Library of Parliament, Nunziata claimed that McKenzie \u201cseemed to be seriously impaired by alcohol\u201d \u2013 a charge that McKenzie later denied, though he did apologize for the incident.Politicians have settled disagreements with their fists since before Confederation. John A. Macdonald, who would go on to become Canada\u2019s first prime minister, once engaged in fisticuffs with a rival, Oliver Mowat, in a legislature in Toronto., he was pulled off of Mowat, shouting:That same historian, Arthur Milnes, said that  during a debate \u2013 by wading into the crowd and punching him.Of course, this kind of violence was more common in Macdonald\u2019s time. The bar underneath the House of Commons likely had something to do with it.\u201cThere were fights in the post-Confed period when the liquor flowed freely, but it came to an end in the twentieth century,\u201d said John English, a former MP and Canadian political biographer.When MPs , one MP quoted a newspaper article which suggested that without alcohol right outside the chamber door, \u201cthe brawls and scenes which have disgraced not only this but previous Parliaments would never have been witnessed.\u201dAt the time, many of the MPs objected, saying that they had never witnessed such scenes.\u201cI have been here for thirteen years and I have never seen any brawls here as the result of indulgence in intoxicating liquors,\u201d said Lachlin McCallum of Monck, Ontario. \u201cI, as a member of the this House and one who does not drink himself, would no more think of preventing members from taking a glass in the evening than I would of depriving them of their cup of tea.\u201dBy tradition, the width of the aisle between the two sides of the House of Commons (3.96 metres) is approximately . Sometimes, that\u2019s not far enough.Of course, Canadian brawls \u2013 at least recently \u2013 have nothing on those in some other countries.

The court has cut its dispute resolution services but that isn\u2019t helping the backlog.The federal government acknowledges the concerns and said this week it is \u201cmoving forward on measures that will facilitate appointments to fill these highly pressing vacancies as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cWe have also committed to a review of the entire judicial appointments process, based on the principles of openness, transparency, merit, and diversity,\u201d a spokesperson for federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said in an emailed statement Monday.\u201cThis review will achieve a greater degree of diversity within the Canadian judiciary, so that it will truly reflect the face of Canada.\u201dGlobal News asked the federal government why this review is taking place and how long it will take.\xa0We were sent an identical statement from a different spokesperson.Ganley said she\u2019s spoken with federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and expects the feds to appoint new judges while it conducts its review.The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench doesn\u2019t know much about the review, either, Somers said.\u201cWe are told they wish to increase the diversity of appointments to the courts, and to make the process more open,\u201d she wrote.', 'Liberals withdraw controversial motion following Trudeau elbowing incidentOTTAWA- Government House leader Dominic LeBlanc says it is withdrawing a controversial motion that would have given the Liberals more control over the ins and outs of parliamentary business.LeBlanc made the announcement at the start of question period in response to a question from interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose.Had the motion passed, a day in the House of Commons would not have ended until a cabinet minister or parliamentary secretary moved to adjourn proceedings.\t\t\t\n\t\tIt would have also made it harder for the opposition to surprise the government like they did earlier this week, when the Liberals had to scramble to their seats for a snap vote on proposed changes to Air Canada legislation.The decision to withdraw the motion comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under fire for a physical encounter with opposition MPs on .Trudeau today for the encounter, which touched off an unprecedented fracas on the Commons floor.', u'Decades-long dispute over value of Citadel Hill nearing resolution: HalifaxMunicipal officials in Halifax say a 22-year-long dispute with the federal government over the value of Citadel Hill is nearing an end.Halifax spokesman Brendan Elliott says acting CAO John Traves has been in discussions with Ottawa recently and feels a resolution will be reached \u201cshortly.\u201dThe  to help determine how much Ottawa owes the city in back taxes for the national historic site.Early last year, the payment in lieu of taxes advisory panel valued Citadel Hill at $41.2 million \u2013 $37.6 million more than what Ottawa argued the national historic site was worth.The panel\u2019s recommendation was sent to the Public Works Department and minister Judy Foote will ultimately make the final decision, more than two decades after the dispute began.The federal government had argued in Canada\u2019s top court that the roughly 16 hectares of land in downtown Halifax was only worth $10 because it has no commercial value.But the Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that Ottawa cannot set payments based on its own property value assessments that are far lower than provincial assessments.While the federal government does not pay property taxes, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act provides a framework for municipalities to collect on federal property such as national historic sites and parks.', u'No charges against Pamela Wallin: RCMPThe\xa0RCMP\xa0has\xa0announced it\xa0will not lay charges against Sen. Pamela Wallin in connection with her expenses.\u201cThe RCMP has completed its thorough investigation into Senator Pamela Wallin\u2019s Senate expenses,\u201d read a statement from Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud released Thursday afternoon.Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill, Wallin said she was relieved, but that she has yet to see\xa0any official paperwork. She promised to make\xa0a more complete statement at a later time.Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos said he\u2019s happy for his fellow senator.Thursday\u2019s announcement comes just weeks after Sen. Mike Duffy  related to his own expenses, alleged bribery and breach of trust.Wallin, a former broadcast journalist, returned to full-time Senate work last year\xa0after being suspended in 2013 with no pay or privileges. Her suspension, which resulted from questions surrounding her travel expenses, was lifted when Parliament dissolved last August for the federal election.There appeared to be little interest among those who\xa0moved to\xa0suspend her the first time to repeat the process and expel her again. On Thursday,\xa0Housakos said\xa0he stands by the disciplinary process that Wallin underwent in the Senate, and that the criminal investigation was always a totally separate matter.Court documents  revealed that the RCMP believed Wallin had broken the law and they were trying to gather proof of criminal wrongdoing.\xa0The Mounties had a file open on the Saskatchewan senator for nearly three years, after a critical audit of her spending ended with her repaying some $150,000, including interest, for claims the Senate said were unjustified.\xa0Wallin\xa0long maintained her innocence and argued she was being singled out for being an activist senator who rubbed some of her colleagues the wrong way. But she\xa0apologized in a 2013 interview with the CBC for failing to ensure her travel claims were appropriate.Former prime minister Stephen Harper appointed Wallin to the Senate in 2009, but Wallin left the Conservative caucus at the height of the expense scandal in 2013.', u'\u2018Elbowgate\u2019: What caused it and why it was an unnecessary kerfuffleIt turns out that the confrontation in the House of Commons on Wednesday night now known as \u201c\u201d was not only politically disastrous for Prime Minister , it was totally unnecessary.The prime minister \xa0Thursday morning after he was\xa0accused of \u201cmanhandling\u201d Conservative whip Gordon Brown \xa0in an effort to pull him through a throng of New Democrats, accidentally elbowing NDP MP Ruth-Ellen Brosseau in the process.Although the\xa0incident lasted only seconds, it has already .\t\t\t\n\t\tBut a closer glance at House procedure reveals that\xa0the prime minister didn\u2019t need\xa0to clear Brown\u2019s path, and the whole thing could have been avoided if the chief government whip, Andrew Leslie, had just sat down. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what happened:The kerfuffle happened just as MPs were getting set to vote on how much more time the House would set aside for\xa0debate on the government\u2019s assisted-dying bill. It\u2019s , and the Opposition parties have accused the government of trying to ram it through the House and Senate using various strategies like assigning a time limit to debate.As Speaker Geoff Regan was trying to set Wednesday evening\u2019s\xa0vote in motion,\xa0several\xa0NDP members, including leader Tom Mulcair, blocked the right-hand aisle. Now, it\u2019s possible they were just standing around chatting, but that\u2019s not , or the prime minister, saw it. Green Party Elizabeth May called it \u201cmischief.\u201dRising in the House after the commotion\xa0had died down, Trudeau explained that like May, he believed the NDP members were\xa0trying to \u201cimpede\u201d Brown.Before a vote can begin in the House, the whips\xa0of the government and Official Opposition must enter together and walk up the centre aisle along their sides (which, incidentally, is why the NDP members weren\u2019t blocking the aisle\xa0on the other side).The whips bow towards the Speaker, then to each other before sitting down. But Brown couldn\u2019t break through the NDP knot, leaving government whip Leslie standing alone at the front of the room wondering what was happening.Rather than\xa0immediately\xa0taking his seat, Leslie went over to talk to his leader. It\u2019s at that point that Trudeau stood up, strode across the chamber and reached for\xa0Brown.But here\u2019s the thing: it turns out Brown didn\u2019t need to be in\xa0his seat for the vote to start. The Speaker\u2019s office confirmed on Thursday morning that only one of the whips needs to sit to trigger voting. If Leslie had sat down, even a wall of\xa0NDP MPs six feet high wouldn\u2019t have mattered.It\u2019s unclear if the NDP members, Leslie, Brown, or even Trudeau knew this rule. NDP House leader Peter Julian certainly knew, however. He told reporters that when the NDP were the\xa0Official Opposition, \u201cwe tried to delay votes\u201d using the same tactic, and were shut down by the one-whip rule.On Thursday morning, Trudeau rose once again in the House and apologized a third time for crossing the floor, grabbing Brown\u2019s arm and accidentally elbowing Brosseau.Trudeau then acknowledged that he had failed \u201cto live up to a higher standard of behaviour.\u201dThe Liberals are still aiming to have the House vote on Bill C-14, the assisted dying law, on Thursday. It must then clear the Senate and receive royal assent, which some senators have suggested will be impossible to accomplish by June 6, when doctor-assisted death will no longer be\xa0illegal in Canada. The government has said it is trying to avoid a legislative vacuum.', u'Trudeau apologizes again in House of Commons for elbowing incidentThe uproar over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s elbowing incident, or #elbowgate on social media, in the House of Commons continued Thursday as Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose called the prime minister\u2019s actions \u201cunsettling\u201d and \u201cunbecoming of a leader\u201dWhile addressing the House, Ambrose said what happened  \u201cwas very unsettling for everyone in this chamber.\u201d\u201cHis behaviour was unbecoming of leader who has the privilege, and let\u2019s never forget it is a privilege bestowed upon him by the people of Canada,\u201d she said.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stood in the House to apologize again to all MPs, the Speaker and also Ruth Ellen Brosseau, with whom he inadvertently elbowed while trying to hurry the Conservative whip to his seat.Trudeau says his actions were not\xa0appropriate, and that it wasn\u2019t his role to try to expedite the vote that was scheduled to take place.\u201cIn my haste I did not pay attention to my surroundings and as a result I made physical contact with the member from Berthier\u2014Maskinong\xe9 something I regret profoundly for which I regret unreservedly,\u201d the prime minister said.Trudeau touched off a firestorm Wednesday in the House when he walked across the aisle in the Commons and pulled Conservative whip Gord Brown by the arm through several MPs, elbowing NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the processGreen Party MP Elizabeth May said Trudeau\u2019s actions in the House on Wednesday were \u201cunwise\u201d but also accidental when he elbowed Brosseau.\u201cThere was no question there was an effort to obstruct a vote,\u201d May told Global News. \u201cBut the last person in the world who should have tried to fix that was our prime minister. It was unwise.\u201dThe incident took place ahead of a contentious vote to limit debate on the government\u2019s .NDP MP Tracey Ramsey told the Commons in the immediate aftermath of the incident that Trudeau uttered a profanity as he approached her caucus colleagues standing in front of Brown.\u201cHe said, \u2018Get the bleep out of the way,\u201d\u2018 Ramsey said in the House. An NDP source who spoke to Ramsey afterwards confirmed the MP had heard Trudeau say \u201cget the f\u2014 out of my way.\u201dBrosseau said she was shocked by the encounter and ended up missing the vote.\u201cI was standing in the centre talking to some colleagues,\u201d Brosseau told the House Wednesday evening. \u201cI was elbowed in the chest by the prime minister and then I had to leave.\u201cIt was very overwhelming and so I left the chamber to go and sit in the lobby. I missed the vote because of this.\u201dThe incident led to chaos and at one point Trudeau came face-to-face with NDP Leader Tom Mulcair.While Trudeau has apologized several times for his actions,\xa0an\xa0all-party committee will investigate the matter.MPs will finish debating a motion by Conservative MP Peter Van Loan on whether \u201cthe physical molestation\u201d of the female MP in the House of Commons should be referred to the Commons committee on procedure and house affairs.\xa0', u'Justin Trudeau grilled on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 about Syrian refugeesHours before Prime Minister \u2018s now-famous , he was shooting a segment for satirical newsmagazine\xa0about Canadian \u201cniceness\u201d and the government\u2019s policy regarding Syrian refugees.In an example of eerie foreshadowing, segment host Hasan Minhaj asks Trudeau \u201cAre you going to kick my ass right now?\u201d right off the top.Trudeau laughs it off, and the two venture into a discussion about the possibility that incoming Syrian refugees might actually be terrorists.\xa0The Canadian prime minister\xa0went on to explain that Canada thrives only by expanding its population and adding to its culture; instead of making the \u201ccircle smaller and smaller,\u201d he believes marginalizing groups of people is what ultimately leads to danger.', u'#elbowgate: Trudeau\u2019s \u2018elbow\u2019 trends on Twitter, creates debateThe accusations Canadian Prime Minister  and manhandled\xa0Conservative whip Gordon Brown\xa0not only caused a stir in the House of Commons, it also caused the collective internet to overheat as well.Tuesday\u2019s incident on Parliament Hill immediately started trending on Twitter with the hashtag #elbowgate.The ultimate debate being considered by Twitter users was whether the situation was being blown out of proportion.(Please take a moment to vote in our poll below and lave us a comment to let us know how you feel about #elbowgate.)\xa0', u'Immigration Minister regrets remark on Syrian refugees use of food banksOTTAWA \u2013 Immigration Minister John McCallum says his suggestion there\u2019s a cultural element driving Syrian refugees to food banks was insensitive and he regrets it.Food banks from Halifax to B.C. have reported serving hundreds of Syrians who have come to Canada since November, the month the Liberal government launched a major resettlement program to bring 25,000 people by the end of February and thousands more by the end of this year.The question of why came up Wednesday at a Senate committee studying the refugee resettlement program and : the fact refugees do not have high levels of income upon arrival and something else.\u201cThere may be a cultural element,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to remember the refugees are coming from an entirely different world.But later Wednesday McCallum met with reporters outside the House of Commons to take back those remarks.To date, about 27,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in Canada, spread among nearly 300 communities.About 15,000 are government-assisted, meaning they receive a year of income support from the federal government linked to the size of the family and provincial social assistance rates.For the 9,400 privately sponsored Syrians, their income is provided by private groups who are expected to provide the same level of support as social assistance rates as well, if not more.The rest of the Syrians who have arrived have their costs shared between the federal government and private sponsors.McCallum said the fact Syrians, or any Canadians, are using food banks raises broad issues about the adequacy of income levels.\u201cI think the fact we need food banks as a country at all says something to questions of inequality of income distribution.\u201dMcCallum\u2019s remarks to the committee drew instant criticism.\u201cI\u2019m very surprised by the word cultural element of going to food banks,\u201d said Conservative Sen. Salma Ataullahjan, who came to Canada from Pakistan in 1980.Another challenge linked to the income levels of government-assisted refugees has been finding housing they can afford. Private sponsors often line up accommodation for their new charges but government-assisted refugees work with settlement agencies to secure a spot.The initial surge of arrivals coupled with high rents in cities like Vancouver and Toronto forced some refugees to remain in hotels for months, but about 98 per cent are now in permanent homes. However, agencies are already working to ensure they don\u2019t lose them by using money from the private sector to provide additional rental funds.The Liberal government has earmarked nearly $1 billion for the Syrian refugee resettlement program and have said a full breakdown of how that money has been spent so far would be made public by the end of this month.McCallum had told the committee there was more that could be done to support the government assisted refugees, though did not provide details.In addition to the refugees already in Canada, thousands more are awaiting final approval on the applications submitted by private sponsorship groups before the end of March.Those groups had originally been told their requests would not be met before 2017 but after an outcry, McCallum agreed to finalize the files by the end of this year or early next and additional staff have now been sent overseas to process the files.\xa0', u'Chaos erupts on Hill: Trudeau apologizes for physical contact with Opposition MPsThe House of Commons appeared to be in utter chaos Wednesday, with the prime minister at the centre of the melee.Justin Trudeau was accused of \u201cmanhandling\u201d the Conservative whip and elbowing NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau on the floor of the House of Commons just prior to a vote on controversial assisted-dying legislation, Bill C-14.\u201cI was standing in the centre talking to some colleagues,\u201d Brosseau told the House after calm was restored. \u201cI was elbowed in the chest by the prime minister and then I had to leave.Footage from the Commons television feed showed Trudeau wading into a clutch of MPs, mostly New Democrats, and pulling Opposition whip Gordon Brown through the crowd in an effort to get the vote started \u2013 a no-no in parliamentary procedure.\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about the Liberal Party\u2019s lack of respect for Parliament, and its unilateral attempts to take control of the House of Commons, which set off tonight\u2019s events,\u201d Brown said afterwards.Trudeau says he was just trying to help the Conservative party whip through a throng of MPs prior to the vote and insists he never intended to hurt anyone.At one point shortly thereafter, Trudeau and NDP Leader Tom Mulcair were in a face-to-face shouting match.\u201cI have never seen anything like it,\u201d NDP MP Niki Ashton said on Twitter. \u201cI witnessed the PM push one of my colleagues into my desk in the House of Commons.\u201dConservative MP David Sweet said the prime minister behaved like a bully.Trudeau apologized after the incident\u201cI came in physical contact with a number of members as I extended my arm,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cI did not intend to offend or impact on anyone.\u201d\u201cI apologize for that unreservedly,\u201d Trudeau said\xa0shortly after.\u201cI take responsibility.\u201dThe incident had the Commons in an uproar as MPs shouted and pounded their desks.\u201cPeople would call what happened here assault,\u201d Ashton said.\u201cTrudeau\u2019s actions weren\u2019t very feminist,\u201d she added.Green Party Leader\xa0Elizabeth May asked for calm.\u201cWhat we saw was unacceptable, but let\u2019s keep perspective,\u201d said May,\xa0adding\xa0Trudeau was trying to move along the vote.\u201cIt was innocent mischief,\u201d she said, to vocal objections from\xa0her fellow MPs.May continued to defend Trudeau, saying Trudeau did not realize\xa0Brosseau\xa0was behind him as he made contact.NDP MP Peter Julian says whether or not the contact was intended, it is inappropriate.\u201cClearly this was not an environment of respect,\u201d said Opposition House Leader Andrew Scheer to reporters outside the Commons.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201dBrosseau, who left after the incident, would likely not be making comment Wednesday Julian said.\u201cIt was a pretty violent push,\u201d\xa0Julian said, adding\xa0physical contact in the House is not the \u201cCanadian way.\u201d\u201cIt was disgraceful.\u201d', u'RCMP officers who spied on journalists reprimanded, Goodale saysOTTAWA \u2013 Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says RCMP investigators have been reprimanded for conducting unauthorized surveillance on two journalists nine years ago.Goodale\u2019s comments Wednesday followed a CBC News report that a rogue group of RCMP officers investigating a leak of a secret document spied on the pair for more than a week without authorization.The Mounties placed two Ottawa-based journalists working for Montreal newspaper La Presse, Joel-Denis Bellavance and Gilles Toupin, under physical surveillance for nine days in 2007, says the report, based on a government briefing note obtained by the broadcaster through the Access to Information Act.The RCMP was looking into the leak of a Canadian Security Intelligence Service document about a terror suspect. The police force hoped that keeping tabs on the reporters would lead them to the leaker.CBC says the surveillance was done without the required permission of Bob Paulson, an acting assistant commissioner at the time and now commissioner of the RCMP.The Mounties had no immediate details Wednesday about the reprimands.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the surveillance was unacceptable and noted that an apology had been given to the journalists involved.NDP Leader Tom Mulcair said a public inquiry should be called into the matter and the New Democrats pressed the Liberals during the daily question period in the House of Commons.\u201cThe unauthorized surveillance was entirely unacceptable. It was contrary to a ministerial directive. It was contrary to RCMP policy, and it was stopped when RCMP headquarters became aware of it, and the investigators have been reprimanded.\u201dThe rogue team was acting contrary to the RCMP rule book for investigations into so-called \u201csensitive sectors,\u201d a term that refers to criminal probes involving academia, politics, religion, the media and trade unions, the CBC said.According to the broadcaster, the briefing note says the unidentified Mounties received \u201ccriticism\u201d for not seeking approval for the nine-day surveillance operation.\u201cWhile journalists have no privilege or immunity from investigation, the application of the RCMP\u2019s sensitive sector approval policy recognizes that the state\u2019s interests in the investigation of crime and the freedom of the press (or religious/academic freedom) need to be balanced appropriately on a case-by-case basis,\u201d says the note, approved by Paulson on Nov. 13 last year.\u201cVital to maintaining this balance is the centralized independent governance of these criminal investigations \u2014 a framework that was just being implemented at the time of these events in 2007.\u201dThough the RCMP monitoring of the two reporters was unauthorized, the note adds that \u201climited physical surveillance\u201d of the journalists was approved by the police force in 2008 but never carried out.', u'Man who abducted his 4 kids, brought them to Iran, says he was escaping \u2018Canadian nightmare\u2019\u2019s story is one that has blazed through social media in Canada for nine months\u2014a bitter marriage breakdown, a fight over four young children, and finally, a dramatic abduction and flight to a Middle East war zone by a father who says he and his kids were escaping a \u201cnightmare.\u201dNow, for the first time since fleeing Canada with the kids last August, the father \u2014an international fugitive\u2014has spoken publicly.\u201cWe were surrounded, we were encircled, we were brutalized,\u201d Dr. Saren Azer told Global News in an exclusive Skype interview from Iran.Azer, an Iranian-born Kurd, came to Canada in 1994 as a political refugee. He married Alison Jeffrey in 2002\xa0and they separated ten years later. What followed was a bitter fight over access to the four children, Sharvahn, 11, Rojevahn, 9, Dersim, 7 and Meitan, 3.After a court-approved European holiday in August 2015, Azer put the children on a flight to Northern Iraq and broke off all contact with the mother. , Azer\u2019s homeland, and moved in with members of his family. (He would not tell Global News the name of the city.)Now Azer is a hunted man, wanted by the RCMP and Interpol on abduction charges.In an emotional Canada-wide campaign, , has pleaded with the to have the children returned.Thousands of supporters joined her on social media, many of them vilifying Azer in the strongest terms. \u201cA disgusting human being,\u201d was a typical posting.Alison was dismissive of her ex-husband\u2019s latest comments.Nine months passed before Saren Azer responded publicly to the storm his actions have generated. In the interview, he rejected Alison\u2019s claim that the children were \u201ctraumatized and terrified\u201d in their new life in a strange land, away from their mother and friends, where they couldn\u2019t speak the language.\u201cThey have never been as well as they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are thriving, they are happy. Our daily life is filled with joy, all of them are healthy, they are well, they are thriving at school, they are learning languages, they are learning different cultures, different traditions, they are surrounded by their families and they are loved and they are adored.\u201cMy children were in a war zone in Canada, they were in a psychological and mental war zone in that country and you could see how their fragile lives were being shattered in front of our eyes.\u201dGlobal News obtained copies of medical reports dated 2013 that point to some psychological and physical problems: delayed gross motor skills for one of the children; significant stress and anger in another; and \u201csuicidal ideation\u201d in a third.In 2012, Azer says, his son Dersim, then only five, was interviewed by an RCMP officer about an allegation by Alison that Saren had disciplined the boy by tying him to a chair in the basement. No charges were laid.In November, 2013, a social worker with the BC Ministry of Children and Family development said in a letter to Alison that \u201cyour children are in need of protection from your ex-husband . . . due to physical harm.\u201dThe harm, the social worker said, included \u201cbeing tied up, slapped and hit.\u201dBut, three months later, the same ministry closed its file on Azer and confirmed he had completed a parenting program. Azer says the physical harm never happened.Alison says Azer, in his interview with Global News, was exaggerating the children\u2019s emotional and physical issues.\u201cNot only were they not as serious, there were no disorders. The children were seen by a long list of healthcare professionals during the period of time that we spent reaching our joint custody agreement.\u201cI think that those papers are a matter of public record via the courts and in no way speak to the conditions or disorders that I think he\u2019s finding it convenient to manufacture at this stage of game being an international fugitive.\u201dSaren Azer, a high-profile humanitarian doctor who once appeared in a video with former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, says he was overwrought by what he saw happening to his children.\u201cWhen I was working in the ICU, almost on a weekly basis I would resuscitate teenagers with suicide attempts. Almost without exception their story was the same\u2013from families that were dominated by hatred, anger, family court proceedings. RCMP proceedings, ministry (of children and family development) proceedings, and I could see the trail that myself and my children were on wasn\u2019t going to be any different. I could see how these fragile and beautiful lives are going to be shattered in this process.\u201dBut to Alison, the abduction by their father will cause her children the most distress.The federal government has said it is treating the situation seriously. The Harper government ended diplomatic relations with Iran in 2012.Azer had a lucrative medical practice on Vancouver Island and the reputation as a humanitarian who made frequent mercy missions to refugee camps in Iraqi Kurdistan. In a 2009 article Alison wrote for an Alberta publication, she said Azer worked in the spirit of celebrated doctors like Norman Bethune and Albert Schweitzer.Azer and Alberta Liberal Party leader Dr. David Swann worked together on a number of human rights causes in Calgary over a period of 10 years.\u201c(He was) absolutely selfless and sacrificial in many different ways,\u201d Swann told Global News. \u201cHe\u2019s put his own money and his own energy and his whole medical career on the line and gave everything he could, especially to the people of northern Iraq and the Kurdish community.\u201dBut in the final analysis, Swann said, \u201cI think he has violated not only the integrity of his family but international law\u201d and that he should return the children to Canada.The law notwithstanding, by the summer of 2015, Azer says it was a clear cut choice: his career, or his children.\u201cI had to decide. My options were to stay in Canada and have all that you mentioned\u2013Canadian citizenship, well-paid physician, respected and all the rest\u2013and the well-being of my children on the other hand, and I chose the well-being of my children.He also extended an invitation for his ex-wife to join him in Iran.\u201cIf Alison truly cares for these children . . . the door is open. I don\u2019t think anybody could stop her from coming to Iran. She has many friends here. She could come here, she could see them. She could spend time with (the children), and she could see their lives. That I can definitely agree with and facilitate.\u201d\u201cWe are an ordinary family. Our important issues now are finding a car, looking after our cats, making our meals, cleaning our house. These are our issues . . . we couldn\u2019t care less about that madness that goes on in Canada.\u201d', u'Phased re-entry into Fort McMurray after wildfire to begin June 1Premier Rachel Notley said  will be allowed to return home on a voluntary, phased basis starting\xa0June 1, as long as several\xa0conditions for safe re-entry are met.As long as the five conditions (listed below) are met, Notley said the return should be completed by June 15.\u201cIf conditions change, as they did just this week, the voluntary re-entry may begin later than June 1,\u201d Notley said. \u201cWe are making our decisions based on the best advice from the most informed and dedicated officials.\u201dThe re-entry will happen\xa0in phases, to allow for efficient traffic flow along Highway 63.\u201cThis re-entry plan is voluntary,\u201d Notley said.\xa0\u201cWe anticipate that many people will not return as early as June 1 and we will support them in that decision.\u201dThose who live in the least-damaged areas of the region will be allowed to return home first. Houses and properties that have been severely damaged will be fenced off.The dates and communities scheduled for re-entry are as follows:The five conditions identified by the Alberta government are as follows:Fort McMurray-Conklin MLA Brian Jean, , said it was a relief to hear a timeline for his constituents\u2019 return but echoed the premier\u2019s sentiments that safety must remain the number one priority going forward.\u201cI know and understand that the people of Fort McMurray, my family, my friends, are going through a lot of anxiety,\u201d Jean said.\u201cThey are tired, stressed and waiting to hear this news, and I thank the premier for it.\u201dJean said he is \u201cfiercely proud\u201d of Fort McMurray and all Albertans, adding he will do everything he can to ensure the community is rebuilt.\u201cWe will rebuild our city better that it\u2019s ever been before and I will stand beside you every step of the way,\u201d he said, holding back tears.Melissa Blake, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo,\xa0said the journey to rebuild is a long one, but said a timeline for re-entry helps make the journey feel a bit shorter.\u201cThis is a wonderful piece of news for us today\u2026 We do have a home to go back to\u2026 We will rebuild and we will be better at the other end of this long journey,\u201d she\xa0said.Blake urged residents\xa0not to expect to see the same place they left when they return.\u201cEnvision and imagine with me what we will be a year from now, five years from now and 10 years from now,\u201d Blake said.\u201cIf you go early, you\u2019re going to have a very different community than you had when you left it. If you wait a little bit longer, all of the efforts that are going into making it the same type of community to go back to will be much further advanced.\u201dThe Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo has released higher-resolution images of the region in order to provide people a more accurate depiction of the state of their homes.The premier and mayor Blake warned viewing the images will be difficult for some.\u201cI caution all citizens viewing these images to keep this in mind. No words can describe the emotions these images will convey and the devastation we have experienced,\u201d Blake said in a message on the municipality\u2019s website.To view the images, .Other things to consider before returning home include:When Wood Buffalo council met on Wednesday afternoon, councillors agreed to waive utility charges for May and June as well as provide relief for\xa0penalties on outstanding amounts owed. It also made 385 residential units available through the Wood Buffalo Housing and Development Corporation but the municipality is also looking at hotels, condos and property managers to shore up temporary housing options for those who are returning without a home.Notley stressed that not everyone should make plans to return to the fire-ravaged region right away. Those who have breathing difficulties, those who have high-risk pregnancies or are nearing the end of their pregnancy and those who are receiving cancer treatment, dialysis or other specialized medical treatments are asked not to return right away.Some people will not have a home to return to. Notley said those who have lost their homes will be able to inspect their properties and collect any surviving items.The government has established the Wildfire Evacuation Transitional Accommodation Benefit to provide eligible evacuees with a stable place to live until they can return home. Albertans can apply for the benefit at any .The province recommends residents bring a three- to seven-day supply of food, including water, as a boil water advisory will be in place until nearly the end of June.Because fridges and freezers may not be usable, people are asked to bring non-perishable items or store perishables in a cooler.Some pharmacies and the hospital will be functioning at basic levels, so it\u2019s recommended people fill prescriptions before returning home.Other items to consider packing include long-sleeved shirts, long pants, rubber boots, flashlights, batteries, camera or video camera to document damage, hand soap and hand sanitizer.Natural gas service is scheduled to be up and running by June 1, Notley said, and electricity has already been restored to undamaged homes. All roads are expected to be open and safe by June 1.However, the hospital will not be running at full capacity by June 1. Still, Notley said it will be equipped to offer primary care, public health, support for home care, some mental health supports, lab services, X-ray and CT imaging, pharmacy and limited types of emergency surgery.Ground and air ambulance service will be available to transport urgent cases to Edmonton if and when it\u2019s needed, Notley said.Notley said schools in the area will not be conducting formal classes until September\xa0and that all\xa0students will advance to the next grade.The announcement comes one day after Notley said the government would have to give the re-entry plan a second look after\xa0an\xa0explosion in a Fort McMurray neighbourhood Monday night.On Tuesday afternoon, Notley said gas had successfully been restored to about 60 per cent of the community.Structural damage assessments were set to be completed Tuesday afternoon. About 89 per cent of structures inspected have been deemed safe to occupy. Ten per cent of structures have been destroyed and about one per cent needed a closer look, Notley explained.However, restoration work in the community has been hampered in the past few days due to extremely poor air quality. As of 2 p.m. MT Wednesday, the air quality health index was 11 in Fort McMurray. That\u2019s measured on a scale of one to 10.It\u2019s been more than two weeks since more than 80,000 Fort McMurray-area residents were forced from their homes. Many have spent the past two weeks wondering when they might be able to return home.As of Wednesday morning, the Fort McMurray wildfire\u2014previously dubbed \u201cthe beast\u201d\u2014.', u'Donald Trump releases list of 11 potential Supreme Court justicesJERSEY CITY, N.J. \u2013 Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has released a list of 11 potential Supreme Court justices he plans to vet to fill the seat of late Justice Antonin Scalia if he\u2019s elected to the White House.Trump\u2019s picks include Steven Colloton of Iowa, Allison Eid of Colorado and Raymond Gruender of Missouri.Also on the list are: Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, Joan Larsen of Michigan, Thomas Lee of Utah, William Pryor of Alabama, David Stras of Minnesota, Diane Sykes of Wisconsin and Don Willett of Texas. Trump had previously named Pryor and Sykes as examples of kind of justices he would choose.The news comes as Trump is working to bring together a fractured Republican Party and earn the trust of skill-skeptical establishment Republicans who question his electability in the general election and conservatives in his party still weary of his commitment to their cause.In a statement, Trump said the list \u201cis representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value\u201d and said that, as president, he would use it \u201cas a guide to nominate our next United States Supreme Court Justices.\u201dHis campaign stressed the list was compiled \u201cfirst and foremost, based on constitutional principles, with input from highly respected conservatives and Republican Party leadership.\u201dTrump first said in March that he planned to release the list of five to 10 judges in an effort to ease concerns about his conservative credentials, which had come under attack in the heated Republican primary.', u'Refugee use of food banks could be \u2018cultural,\u2019 says John McCallumCanada\u2019s immigration minister drew a few raised eyebrows at a Senate committee meeting on Wednesday morning when he cited \u201ca cultural element\u201d as a possible explanation for Syrian refugees making use of food banks.John McCallum was appearing before the Senate Human Rights Committee to update senators on the progress of resettlement efforts for the tens of thousands of refugees who arrived over the last few months from war-torn Syria and the surrounding regions.Asked by Conservative Sen.\xa0Salma Ataullahjan about the refugees relying on food banks, the minister said it\u2019s to be expected at the moment, because many are living off the equivalent of a social-assistance cheque each month.The government did not want to provide refugees with more financial support than what a Canadian citizen on social assistance would receive, McCallum explained, because that would not appear fair. The private sector has stepped up to boost\xa0the monthly refugee support in some cases, he added.But then McCallum added that\xa0\u201cthere may be a cultural element\u201d to the food bank use.Ataullahjan, who was born in Pakistan, said the comment had \u201cthrown me.\u201d\u201cI thought you relied on food banks because you need food,\u201d she said, before swiftly moving on to another line of questioning.Food banks from Toronto to Surrey to Charlottetown have reported spikes in use over the past several months, with some saying the government and private sponsors\xa0are not picking up enough of the financial slack for refugees. While food banks anticipated some increase in demand\xa0over time, one director in Toronto recently\xa0 that it happened almost immediately after the refugee program kicked into high gear.McCallum directly addressed some of the major challenges associated with welcoming over 25,000 privately and publicly sponsored refugees on Wednesday, saying that the biggest issue\xa0\u2014 housing\xa0\u2014 has largely been resolved. About 98 per cent of the new arrivals , he said.The major battles\xa0now, according to McCallum, are language and jobs. In order to integrate successfully, Syrians have to learn either English or French and find employment.The government-assisted refugees often don\u2019t speak a word of English or French, and many come from rural areas of Syria. They have lower levels of education as a result, McCallum said.The minister told the senators, however, that he\u2019s confident that in the \u201cmedium term\u201d these Syrians will be able to take advantage of government-sponsored programs to brush up on language and gain marketable skills.That doesn\u2019t mean everyone is happy about it, however. McCallum acknowledged there has been backlash, and racism, as the Syrians have arrived in cities and towns across the country.\u201cOn an international scale we do well \u2026 but we are far from perfect and I\u2019m acutely aware of this situation,\u201d he said.', u'What was the Komagata Maru incident and why does it matter?At 3:15 p.m. ET Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\xa0is  and apologize for an incident that occurred just over a century ago in Vancouver\u2019s Burrard Inlet.For many Canadians, the name Komagata Maru means little. But what happened on that crowded ship in 1914 has become, for many scholars, emblematic\xa0of an entire period of Canadian history characterized by xenophobia, racism and exclusionary immigration policies.Simply put, more than 350 people were denied entry to Canada and sent back across the Pacific Ocean \u2014\xa0some of them to their deaths \u2014\xa0because they weren\u2019t the right colour or religion. Here\u2019s a primer on what happened.The Komagata Maru was a coal-transport steamship that had been converted into a passenger ship by Hong Kong-based businessman Gurdit Singh. It set off from Hong Kong in April 1914,\xa0reaching\xa0Vancouver\u2019s harbour a month later with 376 people on board, most of them Sikhs like\xa0Singh.The Komagata Maru was, in a sense, designed as a\xa0test of Canada\u2019s increasingly\xa0strict immigration policies. Among the most cumbersome requirements for new arrivals was the\xa0Continuous Passage regulation, instituted by the Canadian government in 1908. It stated that immigrants must \u201ccome from the country of their birth, or citizenship, by a continuous journey\u201d and using tickets \u201cpurchased before leaving the country of their birth or citizenship.\u201dThat means if you were born in\xa0India, went to\xa0China, and then continued on to Canada, you were illegal.The trouble\xa0was, no steamships travelled\xa0directly between Calcutta and Vancouver. Even if an Indian national\xa0had somehow managed to make a continuous journey, another law stated that they needed $200 in their pockets in order to be welcomed into Canada.The policies were specifically designed to curb the flow of Indian immigrants in the early 20th\xa0century, who were coming to Canada seeking work.They weren\u2019t the only people\xa0who faced an uphill battle to get here.\xa0A few years before, a\xa0$500 entry tax for\xa0all Chinese immigrants was put in place, which is what led companies short on labourers to turn to India in the first place.White, Christian migrants from northern Europe and America were seen as far more desirable.Singh knew about these preferences and policies, but argued\xa0that because\xa0the passengers on the Komagata Maru were British subjects, they should be able to move to another Commonwealth nation like Canada freely.Canadian officials disagreed, and the ship was denied docking by the authorities. Just 20 returning Canadian residents, plus the Komagata Maru\u2019s\xa0doctor and his family, were allowed to disembark.Eventually, after a two-month standoff in the waters just off Vancouver, the ship was escorted back out to sea by the Canadian military. During the span of time it sat in the harbour, the\xa0Komagata Maru became something of a media sensation, and drew\xa0plenty of attention from the\xa0public at large.The steamship eventually\xa0ended up back in India,\xa0where, according to scholars at , 19 of the passengers were killed by gunfire upon disembarking. Others were imprisoned.Descendants of the passengers have been asking for a formal apology from Ottawa for years.\xa0Today, Canada\u2019s Sikh population stands at a little under 500,000.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s apology on Wednesday will come eight years after the provincial government in British Columbia offered a similar mea culpa. Former prime minister Stephen Harper did offer an apology on behalf of the federal government in 2008, but it was at\xa0a cultural gathering in British Columbia and not in the House of Commons.It was summarily rejected by the\xa0Prof.\xa0Mohan\xa0Singh Memorial Foundation, which has been at the forefront of the requests for a formal apology. The foundation has \xa0that yielded little in the way of results.Then, in\xa0April, came the news that Trudeau would apologize in the House on May 18. The prime minister acknowledged that\xa0the ship was turned away because of clearly discriminatory policies.', u'Foreign hackers spying on U.S. presidential candidates, says intelligence directorWASHINGTON \u2013 The United States sees evidence that hackers, possibly working for foreign governments, are snooping on the presidential candidates, the nation\u2019s intelligence chief said Wednesday. Government officials are working with the campaigns to tighten security as the race for the White House intensifies.The activity follows a pattern set in the last two presidential elections. Hacking was rampant in 2008, according to U.S. intelligence officials, and both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were targets of Chinese cyberattacks four years later. Despite that history, cyber experts say neither Donald Trump\u2019s nor Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign networks are secure enough to eliminate the risk.\u201cWe\u2019ve already had some indications\u201d of hacking, James Clapper, director of national intelligence, said Wednesday at a cybersecurity event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. He said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security were helping educate the campaigns.Of the attacks, Clapper predicted, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably have more.\u201dThe revelation comes after a Clapper\u2019s office released a document earlier this month saying foreign intelligence services tracked the 2008 presidential election cycle \u201clike no other.\u201d The document was part of a slide show used to warn incoming Obama administration officials that their new jobs could make them prey for foreign spies.Eight years ago, foreign intelligence services \u201cmet with campaign contacts and staff, used human source networks for policy insights, exploited technology to get otherwise sensitive data, engaged in perception management to influence policy,\u201d the document said. \u201cThis exceeded traditional lobbying and public diplomacy.\u201dJonathan Lampe with InfoSec Institute, a private information security company in Chicago, said security hasn\u2019t improved significantly since then.In October, he evaluated the security of sixteen candidates\u2019 websites and wrote a pair of 20-page reports. Using the reconnaissance skills of a casual hacker, Lampe pulled full lists of site user names and technologies used on most sites. In some cases, he discovered which directories were accessible from the Internet and which weren\u2019t. He learned what software products Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s used from a job posting soliciting a computer-wise staffer.\u201cEverybody was sitting with their pants down and by the time we looked at the sites in March, everybody had made fixes,\u201d Lampe said.But countries are probably still snooping, he said: \u201cThe sites were open enough back in October that anyone who grabbed the information then and wanted to use it, could still use it now.\u201d', u'Justin Trudeau formally apologizes for Komagata Maru incidentOTTAWA \u2013 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally apologized in the House of Commons for a 1914 government decision that barred most of the passengers of the Komagata Maru from entering Canada.The chartered vessel was carrying 376 Indian passengers, nearly all of them Sikhs, bound for what they thought would be a new life in Canada.They were hoping to challenge the immigration laws at the time which refused entry to any Indians who had not arrived in Canada via a continuous journey from the home country _ nearly impossible at the time.\t\t\t\n\t\tCanadian officials refused to allow the Indians in, even though they were British subjects just like every other Canadian of the time.After 20 passengers who had previously lived in Canada were allowed to disembark, the ship was turned away.It returned to India, where 19 of the passengers were killed in a skirmish with British authorities and dozens of others were imprisoned or forced into hiding.\t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cMr. Speaker, today I rise in this House to offer an apology on behalf of the government of Canada, for our role in the Komagata Maru incident,\u201d Trudeau said.\u201cCanada cannot solely be blamed for every tragic mistake that occurred with the Komagata Maru and its passengers.\u201cBut Canada\u2019s government was, without question, responsible for the laws that prevented these passengers from immigrating peacefully and securely. For that, and for every regrettable consequence that followed, we are sorry.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tTrudeau\u2019s formal apology is the second from a Canadian prime minister. Former prime minister Stephen Harper delivered an apology in 2008 in British Columbia, not the House of Commons.Some Indian-Canadians saw Harper\u2019s move as a slight.\t\t\t\n\t\tTrudeau promised the Commons apology during the last election campaign.The B.C. legislature passed its own resolution apologizing in May 2008.\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'Medical pot lobby group gets new name: Cannabis CanadaOTTAWA \u2013 In a sign of the times, the country\u2019s licensed medical marijuana producers have renamed their trade group Cannabis Canada.The association says the scope of its work is evolving along with a changing environment \u2013 which includes the Trudeau Liberal government\u2019s promise to legalize and regulate the sale of non-medical marijuana.The Harper Conservatives had already relaxed rules governing the production, sale and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes \u2013 providing a legal framework for a new industry producing pot and derived products.Cannabis Canada will include licensed producers that have been represented by the Canadian Medical Cannabis Industry Association but will also accept applications from other types of stakeholder.Its stated mission is to support the development of a regulated pot industry and promote industry standards.Canada\u2019s federal government says it will introduce new legislation in the spring of 2017.', u'Delinquency rates for non-mortgage loans on the rise in Canada: TransUnionOTTAWA \u2013 Delinquency rates for non-mortgage loans are on the rise in Canada and it appears the problem can be linked to trouble in the oilpatch, according to credit monitoring agency TransUnion.TransUnion says the ratio of accounts 90 or more days past due increased to 2.52 per cent in the first three months of the year from 2.45 per cent in the same period a year ago.However, in Alberta, hard hit by the downturn in oil prices, the rate increased to 2.8 per cent from 2.5 per cent a year ago, while in Saskatchewan, the rate increased to 3.04 per cent from 2.88 per cent.Meanwhile, rates in British Columbia ticked lower to 2.43 per cent from 2.47 per cent and Ontario improved to 2.57 per cent from 2.59 per cent.\u201cWhen it comes to loan default rates, we are looking at two distinct groups: oil-sector provinces and the rest of the country,\u201d said Jason Wang, TransUnion\u2019s director of research and analysis in Canada.\u201cWe continue to see material delinquency increases in the oil provinces and we suspect that it will continue over the next few quarters.\u201dThe increase in the national delinquency figures came as the average Canadian\u2019s non-mortgage debt level grew to $21,348 compared with $20,785 a year ago.TransUnion noted that debt levels were up for auto loans, credit cards and instalment loans. However, lines of credit were lower.Wang said average balances haven\u2019t moved much on an overall basis.\u201cBut once we segment by risk tiers, we find a gradual shift where subprime consumers are increasing their share of the debt load relative to the low-risk population,\u201d he said.', u'Ottawa to ease restrictions on allowing transgender people to change sex designationOTTAWA \u2013 The federal department charged with overseeing every social insurance number in the country says it is working to loosen rules to make it easier for transgender Canadians to change the sex designation on the record.Employment and Social Development Canada says, among other things, social insurance number holders wouldn\u2019t need a new birth certificate to change the sex designation on their social insurance record.Currently, someone who wants to make such a change has to provide a birth certificate or immigration document showing they have changed their sex designation from birth.Since 2015, the department has allowed people to make the change in cases where a revised birth certificate isn\u2019t available.That happened just as the department headed to mediation at the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal after failing to easily allow Christin Milloy to change the designation on her record to female.Milloy has argued the department doesn\u2019t need to collect the information at all.Should mediation fail, the tribunal could force the government to stop collecting the information altogether.A spokesman for the department says the sex designation is primarily used for gender-based analysis, \u201cand not for determining eligibility for benefits.\u201d It is also used by provincial and federal agencies who use the social insurance registry, like the RCMP, student loan programs and the Canada Revenue Agency, to validate someone\u2019s identity.A review of the system and talks with those agencies \u201crevealed concerns over the complete removal of sex information\u201d from social insurance records, department spokesman Josh Bueckert said in an email.Bueckert said the department doesn\u2019t know how many people ask for a change in the sex designation annually \u2013 those numbers aren\u2019t tracked.', u'Michelle Rempel credits NDP MP for helping change her mind on transgender billOTTAWA \u2013 Conservative MP Michelle Rempel says a lot has changed in the three years since she voted against a proposed bill that would have made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender identity of expression.For one, there\u2019s her friendship with NDP MP Randall Garrison, whose private member\u2019s bill to defend the rights of transgender Canadians was gutted last year in the Senate, but inspired the new bill introduced Tuesday by the Liberal government.\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of really thoughtful work on this issue that I would consider to be non-partisan, and we\u2019ve had some very good chats about this,\u201d Rempel said Tuesday from Copenhagen, where she is attending the Women Deliver conference.She said she\u2019s strongly inclined to support the legislation, known as Bill C-16, although she wants to read it thoroughly before officially making up her mind.Garrison said he expects many Conservatives who voted against his bill to support this one, and confirmed that friendship might have something to do with it.\u201cThat\u2019s helped change some minds.\u201dRempel, who had voted against Garrison\u2019s bill at third reading despite supporting it at second reading, acknowledged at the time that the transgender community faces discrimination, including violence.But she was concerned the legislation lacked concrete measures to protect people from violence and other forms of discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression, making it little more than a symbolic gesture.Since then, she said, the transgender community has done a lot of work on the issues of housing, workplace discrimination, violence and identification cards and she now believes federal legislation would also send a message to provincial and municipal governments.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a panacea,\u201d Rempel said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to change all of those things overnight.\u201cBut I think it has been very clear over the last three years that the community feels this is a very important step in the right direction.\u201dInterim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose has also changed her mind, saying Tuesday that she would be supporting Bill C-16 and that her caucus colleagues would be free to vote as they wish.\u201cWhile I know that in the past the courts have ruled that all of those protections do exist in the law, I do think the specific recognition and codification in law is important,\u201d Ambrose said.So does Conservative MP David Tilson.\u201cI believe there is discrimination against these individuals and that discrimination should stop,\u201d Tilson said when asked why he would be supporting this version of the bill.Other Conservative MPs said they looked forward to reading the bill and debating it with their caucus colleagues.One person who is unlikely to change his mind is Conservative Sen. Don Plett, who was behind amendments to the previous bill that included exempting public washrooms from the legislation.\u201cMy views on the issues have not changed\u201d and probably won\u2019t, said Plett.But since it\u2019s a government bill, the rules surrounding it are different than they were for Garrison\u2019s legislation, Plett added, saying he would take the coming weeks and months to think it over.', u'Bernie Sanders wins Oregon primary, Hillary Clinton declares victory in KentuckyWASHINGTON \u2013 Bernie Sanders won Oregon\u2019s presidential primary and battled Hillary Clinton to a neck-and-neck outcome in Kentucky on Tuesday, vowing to soldier on as Clinton sought to blunt his momentum ahead of her likely general election matchup against Republican Donald Trump.The race in Kentucky was too close to call, but Clinton wrote on her Twitter feed: \u201cWe just won Kentucky! Thanks to everyone who turned out. We\u2019re always stronger united.\u201d With almost all the votes counted, Clinton held a narrow lead of less than one-half of 1 per cent as she tried to avoid ending the primary season with a string of losses to the Vermont senator.Trump won the sole GOP contest in Oregon, where Sanders was declared the winner shortly after the polls closed in the liberal-leaning state.Rallying supporters in California, Sanders said he would end up with about half of the delegates in Kentucky and promised to press forward even though he would need to win about two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates to end the primary season in a tie.\u201cBefore we will have the opportunity to defeat Donald Trump, we\u2019re going to have to defeat Secretary Clinton,\u201d Sanders said to cheers in Carson, California.Clinton holds a commanding lead of nearly 300 pledged delegates over Sanders and a dominant advantage among party officials and elected leaders known as superdelegates. The outcomes in Kentucky and Oregon did not dramatically change the delegate count and the former secretary of state remains on track to clinch the nomination on June 7 in the New Jersey primary.Tuesday\u2019s elections took place amid new questions about party unity following a divisive weekend state party convention in Nevada. Supporters of Sanders tossed chairs and made death threats against the Nevada party chairwoman at the event in Las Vegas, arguing the party leadership rigged the results of the convention in favour of Clinton.In a sign of the tensions between the two sides, Sanders issued a defiant statement Tuesday dismissing complaints from Nevada Democrats as \u201cnonsense\u201d and said his supporters were not being treated with \u201cfairness and respect.\u201dIn California, Sanders urged the party to be welcoming to voters who are \u201cprepared to fight for real economic and social change.\u201d Addressing the party\u2019s leadership, Sanders declared, \u201cOpen the doors, let the people in.\u201dTrump won the only Republican contest in Oregon. The billionaire businessman picked up nine delegates earlier Tuesday in Guam, which held its territorial convention in March, and had 1,143 delegates heading into the Oregon contest \u2014 fewer than 100 delegates short of the 1,237 he needs to clinch the nomination.For Democrats, 55 delegates were up for grabs in Kentucky and 61 delegates were at stake in Oregon. Clinton and Sanders will each pick up at least 25 delegates in Kentucky, with five delegates remaining to be allocated pending final vote tallies. In Oregon, Sanders will receive at least 28 delegates and Clinton at least 24 with the remaining delegates awarded according to vote tallies.The Sanders campaign did not immediately say whether it will challenge the results in Kentucky, which does not have an automatic recount.In Kentucky, the former secretary of state visited black churches, a small-town diner and held rallies on Sunday and Monday in an effort to break up Sanders\u2019 momentum after his recent victories in Indiana and West Virginia.Clinton\u2019s husband, former President Bill Clinton, was the last Democrat to carry the state in a presidential election \u2014 he won Kentucky in 1992 and 1996 \u2014 and the former first lady tried to emphasize those ties in the days leading up to the primary.\u201cI\u2019m excited about the primary but we\u2019ve got to turn a lot of people out,\u201d Clinton told a packed diner in Paducah, Ky., on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019m not going to give up on Kentucky in November. I want to help to bring back the kind of economy that worked for everybody in the 1990s.\u201dNearing the end of a long primary slog, the two Democratic candidates are preparing for June 7 primaries in California, New Jersey and four other states and then the District of Columbia primary on June 14. When pledged delegates and superdelegates are combined, Clinton is now about 96 per cent of the way toward securing the Democratic nomination.', u'\u2018Jails are not hospitals\u2019: Health workers call for end to incarcerating sick detaineesDespite calls from \u201coutraged\u201d Ontario health workers, the province\xa0won\u2019t stop putting immigration detainees in provincial jails any time soon.As Global News has reported,  \u2014 often for years on end.Provincial and federal governments say they\u2019re reviewing their policies but won\u2019t commit to changes.The people being held by \xa0aren\u2019t charged with any crime: They\u2019re non-citizens whose status in Canada is uncertain and who border police consider a flight risk.The border police have hundreds of people in detention at any given time across the country. They don\u2019t have places to put many of them, and they lack the health resources to treat people with often complex needs.So  instead.The federal government has contracts with the provinces in which they pay to keep immigration detainees in provincial jails.\xa0In 2013-14, .Once these people are in jail, , these people are put in solitary confinement indefinitely because of their mental illness.\u201cWe are absolutely outraged,\u201d Toronto psychiatrist Michaela Beder told Global News.Beder is one of 146 signatories to  calling on  to cancel Ontario\u2019s agreement to\xa0jail immigration detainees at the CBSA\u2019s request., who is responsible for the Border Services Agency, has said he\u2019s reviewing their practices and accountability mechanisms. There\u2019s no timeline for that review.In the meantime, Ontario will keep jailing people at the CBSA\u2019s request.Whether to jail sick people is \u201csomething for the federal government to consider, because they\u2019re the ones who make the decision as to who comes into their custody or is a detainee,\u201d Naqvi said.Naqvi noted the province tried to keep immigration detainees separate from other inmates\xa0and .As part of , Ontario agreed to stop using mental illness as a reason for putting people in solitary confinement.But Naqvi won\u2019t commit to following through on that.\u201cWe\u2019re still doing a consultation, talking with our partners, our frontline staff. And we\u2019re going through a fair bit of information that\u2019s available to us,\u201d he .Beder argues many of the people being detained probably don\u2019t need to be held against their will at all. And the ones who are really sick, she said, should be in hospital., psychiatric prisons designed to care for sick inmates are the deadliest and most violent in the country.\u201cPeople who\xa0are there as immigration detainees, for administrative reasons, often have severe histories of trauma. They might be refugee claimants who\u2019ve come from war-torn countries\xa0\u2026\xa0and then to place them in a jail? What kind of a welcome is that?\u201dJana Caiscoba\u2019s welcome to Canada was the treatment she\u2019d left home to flee.Caiscoba, who says she was locked in a Czech psychiatric hospital and abused because of her schizophrenia, was detained at the airport by border police.She spent eight months at Vanier Detention Centre in Milton \u2014 much of it in lockdown, she says.\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she said.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and I was locked up in jail for eight months.\u201d', u'Trump defies convention, sends teams to Democrat-leaning statesWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump is rushing to install operatives in several states that traditionally favour Democrats, pointing to a general election plan consistent with the campaign he has run thus far: Defying conventional wisdom and political trends.The staffing expansion includes Maine, Minnesota and other places where Trump opens as the underdog, with the New York billionaire seeking to expand the electoral battlefield by drawing on his appeal among working class white voters \u2014 and probable Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s perceived weakness with them. Still, it is an unlikely path to the White House, through states that no Republican presidential candidate has carried since the 1980s.\u201cI will win states that no Republican would even run in,\u201d Trump told The Associated Press in a recent interview.The Trump campaign has identified roughly 15 states where it plans to install state directors by the end of the month. They include traditional battlegrounds like Ohio, Florida and Virginia and more challenging terrain such as Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Maine \u2014 places Republican have lost for the last six presidential elections or longer. Target states also will likely include Republican-leaning Georgia, where demographic shifts benefit Democrats.Trump\u2019s deployment of political operatives was outlined by campaign strategists who weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about internal strategy and demanded anonymity. The plan will be subsidized, at least in part, by the Republican Party\u2019s new \u201cbuilding fund,\u201d a lightly regulated pool of money that can include donations of more than $100,000 from individual donors, they said, though rules for doing so might pose an obstacle.Trump is still playing catch-up at this point. While Clinton is already weeks into her own swing-state effort, Trump\u2019s team is scrambling to build a national organization essentially from scratch.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cUp until three weeks ago, there were 102 or 103 employees, which is fewer than Ben Carson had in January,\u201d Trump aide Barry Bennett said. \u201cToday, that number is much bigger, and it\u2019s growing every day.\u201dThe former reality television star\u2019s success in the GOP primary season was fueled almost exclusively by personality and a flood of free media coverage. His expansion into new states signals recognition that Trump must grow his bare-bones operation to be competitive this fall, even if he doesn\u2019t fully embrace other modern-day political tactics.He refused to add a pollster for the first 11 months of his White House bid, relying on sometimes questionable public polls when making strategic decisions. Shifting toward November\u2019s vote, he recently hired GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio.It\u2019s a step toward professionalizing the campaign. Up to now, Trump\u2019s strategists have relied on the Republican National Committee\u2019s voter data and internal poling to guide the battleground state staffing plan. Going forward, Fabrizio will work with Trump and committee staff on voter modeling, overseeing polling and voter targeting, according to someone familiar with the hiring.Trump\u2019s team aims to have about fifteen state directors on the payroll by June 1, supplementing more than 200 committee operatives nationwide. Communications, events and \u201ccoalitions\u201d chiefs will augment the campaign\u2019s presence.But bringing in more players doesn\u2019t necessarily make a winning team. Some of the most experienced swing-state Republican operatives have shunned Trump and it\u2019s unclear how many might work for him now that he has almost clinched the Republican nomination. Without them, he would be left with a pool of state-based loyalists, many inexperienced and unknown to the campaign\u2019s leaders.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tTo help fund the expansion, Trump\u2019s strategists said he\u2019ll draw from a fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee that should be signed in coming days. Clinton has a similar agreement with Democrats, enabling her to collect checks of more than $350,000 from individual donors.Trump\u2019s agreement is expected to allow for even larger checks. That\u2019s because the pact will include the \u201cbuilding fund,\u201d which Congress created in 2014 that will enable Trump and Republicans to pull $100,000-plus per donor, despite his repeated criticism of campaign donations.Republican National Committee spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said no funds from that account will be used to pay for campaign staffers. She said the money would only go to \u201cthe operation of the RNC headquarters.\u201dTrump\u2019s team concedes it wasn\u2019t prepared to shift so suddenly toward the general election. Up until only two weeks ago, it appeared as though the GOP primary would last until the party\u2019s July national convention.\u201cNobody complaining that we\u2019re behind schedule,\u201d Trump supporter, Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., said, noting Democrats are still locked in a primary fight.Collins expects Trump\u2019s message to resonate in states like his and \u201ctraditional rust belt areas\u201d such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, where many working-class voters usually don\u2019t support Republicans. Among Democrats, Clinton won those three states but lost in Michigan and West Virginia to Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u201cWhether you call them Reagan Democrats, blue dog Democrats, whatever, that\u2019s what puts those areas in play and why I think he\u2019s going to win in a landslide,\u201d Collins said.', u'EXCLUSIVE: Fort McMurray wildfire: Alberta agency tasked with preventing wildfires leaves millions unspentAs the  continues to grow, the organization responsible for implementing Alberta\u2019s wildfire prevention strategy has left millions in government grants unspent, according to its own annual reports.The Forest Resource Improvement Association of Alberta received $23.6 million in provincial funding between 2014 and 2016 earmarked specifically for  programming, but spent only $6.9 million on wildfire prevention and mitigation during the same period. For every dollar FRIAA received in government grants, 71 cents went unspent.The FireSmart program is a patchwork of community grant programs and direct investments administered by the provincial and federal governments, as well as FRIAA. The program requires communities to submit proposals to either the province or FRIAA for review. Proposals are then accepted, denied or sent back to the community for revision.\u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating knowing how much money was left on the table to help communities combat wildfires in Alberta,\u201d said Tany Yao, the Wildrose MLA for Fort McMurray \u2013 Wood Buffalo and a former fire chief.\u201cMany communities across our province face extreme risk from forest fire, and it only makes sense to do everything possible to protect our communities from that risk,\u201d added Yao.\u201cIt\u2019s up to the government to explain to Albertans why these crucial funds have gone unspent when it potentially could have helped contribute to prevention and containment measures in not just Fort McMurray, but across Alberta,\u201d he said.Early this month, a massive wildfire swept through Fort McMurray, decimating 1,600 buildings and . Residents still have no idea when they\u2019ll be able to return home or what the community might look like when they do.As of March 31, 2016, FRIAA\u2019s FireSmart account contained $16.7 million in unspent taxpayer money. This figure represents more than half of the total $32.7 million allocated by the province to safeguard communities against the effects of wildfires over the past three years.\u201cI encourage communities in forested areas in Alberta to take advantage of that funding,\u201d said Oneil Carlier, Alberta\u2019s Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.When pressed on whether the province should take a greater role in administering the FireSmart program and in assisting communities access these funds, Carlier admitted that the province could do more.\u201cPerhaps they need a little more encouragement,\u201d said Carlier. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s an education model we can do with our communities and our citizens to knowing the FireSmart program is a proven and effective tool that they can use to help prevent, a little bit anyway, wildfires in their communities.\u201dBut Carlier insists ultimate responsibility for safeguarding citizens against wildfire rests with individual communities.\u201cThe communities really have to take ownership of it as well, right?\u201d said Carlier. \u201cAnd who knows better what they might need in their own community?\u201dFRIAA has told Global News $4.3 million of the $16.7 million left unspent has been committed to future projects. An additional $4 million in projects could be approved as early as this week, according to FRIAA.\u201cFireSmart funding is a whole range of things, from public education and outreach to project and master planning,\u201d said Todd Nash, managing director of FRIAA.\u201cBut we can only allocate money to those projects communities propose,\u201d he added.FRIAA has received 223 community grant applications from 80 communities across Alberta over the past three years. Of these, only 113 have been approved \u2013 approximately 50 per cent. The vast majority of declined proposals are the result of either ineligible applicants or ineligible projects \u2013 indicating that communities may not yet fully understand exactly how the FireSmart program works.Nash acknowledged some communities \u2013 particularly smaller ones \u2013 have been slow to adopt FireSmart strategies, and that the initial rounds of applications were characterized by either incomplete or insufficient proposals.\u201cWe hired experts to go out and talk to communities and to make them aware that these funding programs were available,\u201d said Nash. \u201cBut there\u2019s a certain capacity at work. There are only so many FireSmart experts, so many consultants.\u201dFRIAA\u2019s website lists 39 approved projects for 2015-16, but provides no information on the costs. Fifteen of these projects include plans for clearing vegetation in and around populated areas, while a number of others focus on developing fire prevention strategies and organizing community outreach programs.One project in particular provided funding for a community barbecue in the Lesser Slave Lake area. Another project provided funds to \u201csolicit feedback and obtain public buy-in for planned vegetation treatments adjacent to residential areas in the Town of Whitecourt.\u201dMike Flannigan, one of Canada\u2019s premier wildfire scientists and the director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta, said communities located in and around the boreal forest should do more to protect themselves against the growing risks posed by wildfires.\u201cThe best solution,\u201d said Flannigan, regarding wildfire prevention and mitigation, \u201cIs to remove all conifers within two kilometres of communities.\u201dAccording to Flannigan, burning embers from wildfires can travel upwards of two kilometres \u2013 as was the case in both the Slave Lake and Fort McMurray fires. Removing highly-flammable species such as black spruce from around communities, said Flannigan, starves potential wildfires of possible fuel sources and gives firefighters and emergency crews a chance to save homes and other important infrastructure by setting up defensive zones.\u201cYou can still have trees nearby,\u201d said Flannigan. \u201cBut a subdivision should not be adjacent to a full, closed-canopy conifer forest. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dWhile Flannigan thinks Alberta has been diligent in combating wildfires, particularly since Slave Lake, he hopes programs such as FireSmart continue to grow and that governments commit to spending the resources already allocated to the prevention and mitigation of damages caused by wildfires.\u201cFire is a common feature of the boreal forest,\u201d said Flannigan. \u201cAnd now more than ever people are working, living and playing in the boreal forest.\u201d\u201cWe have this intersection between fire and people \u2013 sometimes with devastating results,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we need programs like FireSmart, and to stop people from starting fires.\u201d', u'15 New Brunswick nursing homes join program to cut seniors\u2019 antipsychotic drug useMore senior citizens across New Brunswick will soon be taking part in a national pilot program to reduce the amount of antipsychotic drugs administered in nursing homes.Fifteen nursing homes across the province are jumping on board with the initiative, thanks to a $600,000 investment from the province.\u201cIt means that for people who are suffering from dementia \u2014 for very elderly people suffering from dementia, that they will not be drugged as a first resort,\u201d said Maureen O\u2019Neil with the Canadian Foundation of Healthcare Improvement.The , where it was determined that 55 residents were taking the drugs unnecessarily.The government says that in 2013, New Brunswick\u2019s rate of use of antipsychotic medication among seniors was two times the rest of the country.The two-year program aims to\xa0improve quality of life for the seniors living in the homes, as well as to provide better care by taking people off unnecessary drugs.It\u2019s expected that the program will improve the lives of more than 100,000 people and save $5.2 billion in the health-care sector in the next 30 years.The 15 nursing homes taking part in the project are:', u'Auditor general points finger at Senate for spending report leakOTTAWA \u2013 Auditor general Michael Ferguson says a leak of his high-profile review of Senate spending couldn\u2019t have come from his office, pointing the finger back at the Senate as the source of the unauthorized release.Ferguson said his office hired an outside security firm to investigate his staff to see if any of them could have leaked the audit to journalists ahead of its .He told senators investigating the source of the leak that he is confident any information in the audit didn\u2019t come from his people, but said he can\u2019t be 100 per cent sure.It was that possibility that senators on the Senate\u2019s rules committee locked on to as they used the morning meeting to blame Ferguson\u2019s office as the source of the leak.This investigation is the second time in as many years that the Senate has looked into the leak of Ferguson\u2019s report, an event that senators argue violated their parliamentary privilege and the right to see the document before the public.In some cases, senators said they learned the details of the audit from reading media reports.Leaks to multiple media outlets, including The Canadian Press, made public the names of nine senators who would be recommended for referral to the RCMP for a criminal review, the total amounts owing for the 30 senators identified in the report as having problematic expense claims and the recommendations Ferguson made to overhaul Senate spending rules.\u201cThat was what was violated \u2013 that this was in the public domain before senators received it in the Senate,\u201d said Sen. Anne Cools.\u201cThat was not violated by me or by my office,\u201d Ferguson responded. \u201cWe did not leak the report.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying that you did,\u201d Cools said.Ferguson outlined how his office increased security around the Senate audit, including logging all staff accessing files, coding files with numbers instead of names and having motion detectors and alarms installed in the room holding audit documents.He said all of this was designed to maintain confidentiality on a report that his office knew had heightened political interest.Ferguson says only 23 hard copies of the report were available ahead of its public release: 12 copies were delivered to the Senate on June 4, one day after 11 copies were made available to Ferguson\u2019s staff.He said no copies or other information were provided to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.The only information Ferguson confirmed publicly before the report was released was the number of senators named in his report.Ferguson said he did that during a CBC television interview because he wanted to set the record straight to end wild, sensationalized speculation.He said it was a decision made on the spot during an interview.The leak of Ferguson\u2019s final report was the last in a series of disclosures during the two-year long audit that senators were told not to publicly discuss and for which they signed confidentiality agreements.Senators ordered the audit in the summer of 2013 amid a spending scandal in the upper chamber that engulfed four of its members.Since then, the Mounties have closed files on at least 24 of the 30 senators named in the report and an independent arbitrator slashed repayment bills for 10 of 14 senators who challenged Ferguson\u2019s findings.The Senate has vowed to take seven former senators to court over their refusal to pay almost $528,000 in improper expense claims outlined in the auditor general\u2019s June 2015 report.', u'Liberals unveil bill to protect transgender people from hate speechOTTAWA \u2013 Transgender Canadians and human-rights champions cheered Tuesday as the Liberal government introduced legislation that would make it against the law to discriminate on the basis of gender identity or expression.The legislation would, if passed, make it illegal under the Canadian Human Rights Act to prevent someone from getting a job or to discriminate in the workplace on the basis of the gender they identify with or outwardly express.It would also update the Criminal Code to extend hate speech laws to include gender identity and expression.Criminal laws would also be updated to make it a hate crime when someone is targeted because of their gender identity or gender expression, meaning judges would have to consider it as an aggravating factor in deciding what sentence to impose.\u201cWe live in a time when discrimination in any form is completely unacceptable,\u201d Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould told a news conference Tuesday after introducing the bill.\u201cThis is a message of hope to ensure that we recognize gender identity and gender expression and provide the ability in our country for people to feel safe and secure in who they are.\u201dShe said it is necessary to make it unequivocal in law that transgender persons have the right to live free from discrimination, hate propaganda and hate crimes.The law was introduced on the .Ten-year-old Charlie Rickert, who was at Wilson-Raybould\u2019s side throughout the news conference, stepped to the podium before a phalanx of cameras and confidently expressed her gratitude to those who had helped bring the bill to the House.\u201cThank goodness this bill is passing because it will protect us from\u2026hateful propaganda, assaults, rape \u2013 stuff like that,\u201d Rickert said.\u201cIt could protect us and stop the people who would have just gone off and done it in the past and discriminated or assaulted us. Now it could be stopping them and then basically punishing them if they actually do it.\u201cI feel much safer.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tSimilar legislation has failed to pass Parliament on multiple occasions, including the most recent attempt last year by NDP MP Randall Garrison, whose bill was gutted in the Senate.This bill is different, said Garrison \u2013 who also stood alongside Wilson-Raybould in a rare display of cross-partisan solidarity \u2013 because it\u2019s a government bill rather than a private member\u2019s bill, which rarely become law.Wilson-Raybould wouldn\u2019t say whether Liberal MPs would be allowed to vote their conscience on the bill or be forced to support it. But she did say she hopes to have support from all parties.\u201cWe look forward to have support from all sides of the House to put forward this incredibly important piece of legislation.\u201dLater in the House of Commons, however, Garrison sought to introduce a motion that would have seen the bill passed speedily with the consent of all parties, but was promptly rejected.Wilson-Raybould also said the law, when passed, would ensure data is collected around violence against transgender Canadians.\t\t\t\n\t\tA survey conducted by Trans Pulse Project in 2010 showed that out of the almost 500 transgender respondents in Ontario, 20 per cent reported having been physically or sexually assaulted, though not all of them reported the assaults to police.The respondent-driven sampling survey found 13 per cent reported being fired and 18 per cent refused a job because they were transgender.Groups including Trans Equality Canada, Amnesty International, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, and the Canadian Association of University Teachers all praised the move by the Liberals, calling it a long overdue move in the path towards equal rights for all Canadians.\u201cIt\u2019s a good first step because that allows for the ability at the federal level to challenge things in court if needed,\u201d said Talia Johnson, an Ottawa-based counsellor.\u201cAny human rights legislation only goes so far, so we need to also work on education so that cases don\u2019t have to come forward in the first place. It\u2019s often very hard to prove discrimination, especially in employment and other areas like that.\u201dWATCH: Quebec Justice Minister Stephanie Vall\xe9e announced the government is working on legislation that will be complimentary to Ottawa\u2019s proposals to protect the rights of transgender people.\t\t\t\n\t\t Interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose\u2019s office says she intends to vote in favour of the new transgender rights legislation introduced Tuesday by the federal Liberal government.That marks a change from Ambrose\u2019s previous position on the issue \u2014 and she\u2019s not the only one. Conservative MPs Michelle Rempel and David Tilson are also among those who are indicating they intend to support the bill, which would make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender identity or expression.\xa0', u'Smuggling networks netted nearly $6 billion in 2015 getting migrants into EuropeTHE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2013 Smuggling networks cashing in on the huge flow of  had an estimated turnover last year of up to $6 billion, international law enforcement agencies said Tuesday.They said that the number of people trying to reach the European Union is expected to increase, with some 800,000 waiting in Libya to cross the Mediterranean. More than 1.2 million people applied for asylum in the EU last year.A summary published Tuesday of a joint Europol and Interpol report also warned: \u201cThere is an increased risk that foreign terrorist fighters may use migratory flows\u201d to sneak into Europe. It noted that two extremists involved in the deadly rampage in Paris on Nov. 13 last year entered the EU through Greece as part of the influx of migrants from Syria.Europol said an estimated 90 per cent of all migrants entering the European Union have their trip facilitated by smugglers, sometimes helped by corrupt officials paid off to ensure boats are released and vehicles allowed to pass borders.Europol Director Rob Wainwright said the report \u201cdescribes the huge role played by organized-crime networks in the migration crisis and sends a clear message to the EU and its member states that we must combat these networks in the strongest possible terms.\u201dThe report was drawn up following a meeting earlier this year of law-enforcement officials in The Hague and is intended to help shape future crime-fighting strategies.It says the turnover of smuggling networks likely was $5-6 billion based on the number of arrivals last year who were helped by smugglers and how much the migrants paid \u2013 an average of $3,200-$6,500 per person.', u'Nevada Democrats: Bernie Sanders campaign has violent streakLAS VEGAS \u2014 Nevada\u2019s Democratic party on Monday warned the Democratic National Committee that Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters have a penchant for violence and may seek to disrupt the party\u2019s national convention in July, as they did during the Nevada convention Saturday.The allegation is the latest fallout from a divisive Nevada Democratic convention that had to be shut down because security at the Paris Las Vegas hotel could no longer ensure order on Saturday night. The gathering closed with some Sanders supporters throwing chairs; later, some made death threats against state party chairwoman Roberta Lange.Sanders\u2019 backers had been protesting convention rules that ultimately led to Hillary Clinton winning more pledged delegates. Clinton won the state\u2019s caucuses in February, 53-47, but Sanders backers hoped to pick up extra delegates by packing county and state party gatherings.Sanders had released a statement Friday night asking supporters to work \u201ctogether respectfully and constructively\u201d at the convention. But the state party alleged in its letter to the co-chairs of the DNC Rules and By-laws committee, \u201cThe explosive situation arose in large part because a portion of the community of Sanders delegates arrived at the Nevada Democratic State Convention believing itself to be a vanguard intent upon sparking a street-fight rather than attending an orderly political party process.\u201dMichael Briggs, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said, \u201cWe do not condone violence or encourage violence or even threats of violence.\u201d He added that the campaign \u201chad no role in encouraging the activity that the party is complaining about. We have a First Amendment and respect the rights of the people to make their voices heard.\u201dOn Saturday, Sanders backers shouted down the keynote speaker, Sen. Barbara Boxer, and others they thought were tilting the rules in Clinton\u2019s favor. Protesters shouted obscenities and rushed the dais to protest rulings. The letter by the state party\u2019s general counsel, Bradley S. Schrager, warns that similarly chaotic scenes could unfold in Philadelphia, site of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s July convention.\u201cWe believe, unfortunately, that the tactics and behavior on display here in Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadelphia in July for our National Convention,\u201d Schrager wrote. \u201cWe write to alert you to what we perceive as the Sanders campaign\u2019s penchant for extra-parliamentary behavior \u2014 indeed, actual violence \u2014 in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can only describe as their encouragement of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere that ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats.\u201dSeveral Sanders backers have condemned some of the threats against Lange and other actions Saturday. Former state assemblywoman Lucy Flores, a current congressional candidate, said in a statement: \u201cThere were actions over the weekend and at the Democratic convention that very clearly crossed the line. Progressives need to speak out against those: Making threats against someone\u2019s life, defacing private property, and hurling vulgar language at our female leaders.\u201dState party offices remained closed Monday for security reasons after Sanders supporters posted Lange\u2019s home and business addresses, email and cell phone number online. Copies of angry and threatening texts to Lange were included with the letter.Lange said she\u2019d been receiving hundreds of profanity-laced calls and texts from inside and outside of the U.S., threatening her life and her family. Lange said the restaurant where she works has received so many calls it had to unplug the phone.\u201cIt is endless, and the longer it goes the worse it gets,\u201d Lange said in an interview. \u201cI feel threatened everywhere I go.\u201d', u'Judge orders Transport Canada to reconsider request for no-fly list detailsOTTAWA \u2013 The public could be a step closer to knowing a jealously guarded federal secret: the number of people on Canada\u2019s no-fly list.A judge has ordered Transport Canada to revisit two Access to Information requests for details of the list\u2019s scope, saying the department did not spell out clearly why the figures should be confidential.In March 2010, Montreal La Presse reporter Daphne Cameron filed a pair of requests \u2013 one for the total number of people on the list, the second for the number of Canadian citizens.Information commissioner Suzanne Legault\u2019s office investigated Cameron\u2019s complaint against Transport and recommended that the agency release the figures.Transport refused to comply, prompting Legault and Cameron to pursue the case in the Federal Court of Canada.Under the no-fly program established in 2007, airlines relied on a list of individuals considered \u201can immediate threat to civil aviation\u201d should they board an aircraft. The program, known as Passenger Protect, still exists but the criteria for inclusion on the list has been broadened to address the phenomenon of \u201cterrorist travellers\u201d heading overseas.In addition, the federal government is reviewing the program due to complaints from several families about airport delays after their children\u2019s names appeared to mysteriously match ones on a security list.In withholding the numbers from Cameron, Transport invoked a section of the access law that shields information whose release could interfere with the conduct of international affairs, as well as the detection or prevention of hostile activities.Federal security officials argued the information could help terrorists plot a catastrophic attack on an airliner.In a ruling made public Monday, Federal Court Justice Simon Noel said Transport Canada rightly characterized the data as protected under the clause.However, Noel added, the department botched an important step by failing to properly exercise its discretion as to whether to release the material.Noel said Transport did not:\u2013 adequately consider the public interest in knowing the figures;\u2013 address the fact a former transport minister had apparently discussed the numbers publicly in broad terms;\u2013 back up its argument that international relations with the United States and others would be harmed by release of the numbers.Legault\u2019s office had no comment Monday on the decision.In a May 2013 letter to Transport, filed with the court, Legault said she was not satisfied the exemption shielding the data from release had been properly applied.Disclosing an aggregate number of people on the no-fly list \u201cwould not allow an individual to determine whether he or she is on the list,\u201d she wrote.The roster is only one of a number of lists used by airlines to ensure aviation security, Legault added. Therefore, even if someone could conclude they were on the list, \u201cthis fact would not transform Canadian or Canadian-bound aircraft into \u2018soft targets,\u2019 as claimed by (Transport Canada).\u201dChristopher Free, a senior Transport Canada intelligence official, was consulted by Transport\u2019s Access to Information division in March 2010 on whether the figures could be disclosed. Free concluded the number of names \u201cwas valuable information for terrorist operational planning\u201d and that its release would harm national security, he said in an affidavit filed with the court.The United States had revealed there were about 16,000 people \u2013 including fewer than 500 Americans \u2013 on its no-fly list.Still, Free said disclosure of the Canadian numbers could \u201cadversely affect our relations with key allies, and especially the U.S.\u201d', u'NDP, Conservatives give Liberals a lesson in House of Commons voteOTTAWA \u2013 The man in charge of organizing Liberal votes in the House of Commons was breathing a sigh of relief Monday after narrowly averting disaster on the government\u2019s proposed Air Canada legislation.\u201cMy blood pressure was a little higher than usual,\u201d said Liberal MP Andrew Leslie, the chief government whip, after the opposition pulled a procedural trick to bring about a snap vote on Bill C-10, which proposes changes to the Air Canada Public Participation Act.Speaker Geoff Regan ended up having to break a 139-to-139 tie, voting with the government, as Liberal MPs raced back to Parliament Hill from around the city, many of them stuck in traffic.Several cabinet ministers were attending the inaugural meeting of the government\u2019s economic advisory council north of Ottawa in Chelsea, Que., while others were away for family funerals.\u201cBut yes, it was a very close call. Too close, actually.\u201dBoth the Conservatives and the New Democrats, who had supported each other in a collective opposition bid to outwit the Liberals, laid the blame for the near miss squarely on the shoulders of the government.\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing debate being shut down and committee time being abbreviated. Now they\u2019re not paying attention to what\u2019s going on in the House, (which) I think is another troubling sign,\u201d said Conservative House leader Andrew Scheer.NDP Leader Tom Mulcair chalked it up to arrogance.\u201cThey just figure that they\u2019re always going to win because they do have a large majority,\u201d Mulcair said as he described watching Liberal MP Judy Foote sprint down the hallway in order to get to the chamber in time for the vote.Government House leader Dominic LeBlanc said his political rivals were the ones showing a lack of respect.\u201cIf they want to do that, fine, that\u2019s entirely their privilege, but it shows a level of immaturity and irresponsibility and we\u2019re going to then have to take precautions, including accepting their word as, frankly, not worth very much,\u201d he said.The Liberals were expecting to hear from NDP MP Alexandre Boulerice on an amendment to the bill, which proposes lifting a long-standing requirement that Air Canada keep its maintenance operations in Winnipeg, Montreal and Mississauga, Ont.The new legislation would instead allow the airline to locate those operations anywhere in the provinces of Manitoba, Quebec and Ontario.But when his time came, Boulerice hid out in the lobby, which forced a vote with a 30-minute warning bell.Even Liberal MP Doug Eyolfson, who had voted against the government at second reading last month, supported the government this time.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be part of a procedural stunt that was undertaken by the opposition today,\u201d said Eyolfson, telling reporters he required no convincing from Leslie and that he would likely vote against it the next time.\xa0', u'Guns, environment, other policies up for debate at Tory conventionOTTAWA \u2013 Before the Conservatives pick a new leader, they will first gather at the end of this month to update the party\u2019s policy handbook \u2013 last refreshed in 2013, two years after the party won its first majority government.This year, the Tories will come together to chew over the lessons learned from their election loss in October and chart a path forward. Many have spoken of a need to update the policy guidelines to reach new voters and bring some former ones back into the fold.Here\u2019s a look at some of the resolutions that must first be debated and passed in closed-door workshops before they can be voted on by broader party membership and added to the book.Some are new additions, others are modifications to existing resolutions.Environment and economy:\u2013 At least three resolutions propose changes to the party\u2019s existing statement on environmental principles. One calls for a commitment to keeping municipal drinking water and sewage free of heavy metals and other pollutants; another proposes adding that the party believes in the \u201cprinciples of conservation and stewardship of renewable resources.\u201d\u2013 Remove the words \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d from the section on clean air and greenhouse gas reductions and replace it with the word smog, among other amendments.\u2013 \u201cThe Conservative party supports banning unpaid internships in any federally regulated institution or enterprise that are more than eight weeks in duration and not supervised by an accredited educational institution.\u201d\u2013 Removing a very lengthy section on tax relief and replace it with \u201cThe Conservative party supports broad-based tax relief.\u201d\u2013 \u201cWe believe the government should support and encourage the private development of the Energy East pipeline.\u201dCriminal justice and social policy:\u2013 The Conservative party \u201csupports conscience rights for doctors, nurses and others to refuse to participate in or refer their patients for abortion, assisted suicide or euthanasia.\u201d\u2013 \u201cA Conservative government recognizes that civilian firearms ownership is a Canadian heritage\u201d as part of three other modifications to existing policy on firearms.\u2013 That peace officers be enabled to issue tickets for simple possession of small quantities of marijuana.\u2013 That the existing policy stating the party would not support any legislation on assisted suicide be replaced with a call for national standards to govern such legislation because \u201cwe believe that all Canadians have the inalienable and private right, after deep personal reflection, to make their own end-of-life decisions.\u201d\u2013 Removal of existing ban on supporting same-sex marriage legislation, while adding support for freedom of religious organizations to refuse to perform unions or allow use of their facilities for events that are incompatible with their faith and beliefs.The role of government:\u2013 That a national referendum must be held prior to implementing any future electoral reform proposal.Foreign policy, Canadian culture and diversity:\u2013 Establish year-round manned bases in the North to solidify sovereignty and increase infrastructure for development.\u2013 That the party believes in a \u201cmutual obligation in the form of a military covenant between the people of Canada and each individual member of the Canadian Forces \u2026 this covenant recognizes that there is no equivalent profession to that of service in the Canadian Forces.\u201d\u2013 Adding the words \u201csafety to Canadians\u201d as part of a statement on how refugee resettlement should be approached.', u'Liberals will table transgender rights bill TuesdayMONTREAL \u2013 Legislation to extend human-rights protections to transgender Canadians will be tabled in the Commons on Tuesday, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Trudeau confirmed the news in Montreal on Monday as he received an award named after Laurent McCutcheon, a longtime gay-rights activist.Tuesday happens to be International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.The Montreal MP said Canada must do more to fight homophobia and transphobia, mentioning that gay men still cannot donate blood in Canada.Trudeau said he will also attend Montreal Pride this summer, \u201cwhich is just a regular part of my summer schedule but a very first for a prime minister.\u201dHe also took the time to mention his father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who received the same award posthumously in 2005 and who was responsible for decriminalizing homosexuality in Canada.Previous attempts at passing a transgender rights bill at the federal level have been unsuccessful.\xa0', u'Filipino \u2018Donald Trump\u2019 indicates he will reimpose the death penaltyPresumptive Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has indicated he will reimpose the death penalty, in some of his first policy pronouncements since winning last week\u2019s election based on an unofficial count.In a wide-ranging news conference, held in his southern hometown of Davao City, Duterte struck a tough tone on Sunday, stating he would order a major offensive to destroy Abu Sayyaf extremists on southern Jolo Island, even if their human rights are trampled in the process.He also signalled a possible thawing of ties with China.The announcements, a sharp departure from current government policy, reflect his brash campaign pledge to end crime and corruption in the impoverished nation in three to six months. Police officials have said the plan is undoable, and that crime remains prevalent in Davao city, where Duterte has served as mayor for more than 22 years.', u'Michael Chong announces bid for Tory leadershipOTTAWA \u2013 Michael Chong joined the Conservative leadership race Monday, breaking ranks with the party\u2019s long-standing opposition to carbon pricing but falling in line on face coverings \u2013 a controversy many believe cost the party votes last October.Chong, a southern Ontario member of Parliament, said with carbon pricing already in effect at the provincial level, the federal Tories must refocus their energies on ensuring the revenues go towards reducing taxes.It\u2019s part of a broad rethink of environmental policy Chong, 45, said he will bring to the race \u2013 one he considers necessary if the Conservatives are to attract new voters and win back the trust of those who deserted them last fall.\u201cWe have to attract younger people to our party and that begins by shifting our positions on issues like the environment,\u201d Chong told a news conference.The Tories were thrust into a leadership contest after former prime minister Stephen Harper stepped down as party chief on election night.His resignation followed a campaign that critics, and later Conservatives themselves, said was marked too much by divisive policies such as the call for a \u201cbarbaric practices\u201d tip line and the relentless push for a ban on wearing face veils during citizenship ceremonies.Chong said he didn\u2019t see those two issues as the sole reasons his party was reduced to Opposition status.But while he disagreed with the tip line, he said he does support the face covering ban, though wouldn\u2019t necessarily push to have it enshrined in legislation.\u201cI agree with the government\u2019s decision on the niqab in respect of citizenship ceremonies,\u201d Chong said.\u201cWe live in a free society and people can wear what they want. However, I also believe that in a free and democratic society it is reasonable under Section 1 of the charter for the state to put a limit on that right in very limited circumstances.\u201d He called citizenship ceremonies one of those circumstances.Chong, whose father was a Chinese immigrant from Hong Kong and mother a Dutch immigrant from the Netherlands, was first elected in 2004 in the riding of Wellington-Halton Hills. He went on to serve in Harper\u2019s cabinet as intergovernmental affairs minister.But he resigned from that position in 2006 because he didn\u2019t support a motion recognizing Quebecers as a nation, calling it ethnic nationalism. He said Monday he stands by that position even today.From his seat on the backbenches, he spearheaded legislation to give individual MPs more power. A bill to that effect became law last fall.As the child of immigrants, Chong said his decision to run was influenced by his upbringing and his family\u2019s past.\u201cMy family\u2019s Canadian story is also the conservative story: it\u2019s a story of hard work, of perseverance, of counting your pennies and investing in your children\u2019s future,\u201d he said.Ontario MP  and Quebec MP  are the other two candidates currently in the race but several others are considering putting their names forward as well.The Conservatives will gather at the end of this month for a policy convention and will choose their next leader in May 2017.', u'Donald Trump expects poor relationship with David CameronLONDON \u2013 Presidential candidate Donald Trump says he may have a poor relationship with Prime Minister David Cameron in light of the British leader\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s call for all Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the United States.Trump\u2019s comments, broadcast Monday on ITV\u2019s  made headlines in Britain, which claims a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with America. Trump\u2019s suggestion of a temporary Muslim ban led to a petition signed by half a million people demanding that Parliament hold a debate on whether he should be banned from the country. Lawmakers held the debate, but rejected a ban.\u201cIt looks like we are not going to have a very good relationship,\u201d Trump said in the interview conducted in New York. \u201cWho knows, I hope to have a good relationship with him (Cameron) but he\u2019s not willing to address the problem either.\u201dCameron has refused to retract comments Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban as \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong.\u201d But Cameron\u2019s spokesman, Dan York-Smith, told reporters that the prime minister was \u201ccommitted to maintaining the special relationship\u201d whoever wins the presidential election.\u201cHe has been clear that he will work with whoever is president of the United States,\u201d York-Smith said.In the interview conducted Saturday, Trump also describes London\u2019s new mayor, Sadiq Khan, as \u201crude\u201d for calling him ignorant. The real estate tycoon said he would \u201cremember\u201d the mayor\u2019s hostile reaction to the idea that Khan, a Muslim, would be given an exception to the temporary ban.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know me, hasn\u2019t met me, doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m all about.

In fact it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cI wished him well when I heard he won, he\u2019s a Muslim, I think it\u2019s ignorant for him to say that.\u201dKhan\u2019s office said American voters would reject Trump\u2019s views.\u201cSadiq has spent his whole life fighting extremism, but Trump\u2019s remarks make that fight much harder for us all \u2013 it plays straight into the extremists\u2019 hands and makes both our countries less safe,\u201d his office said in a statement.When reminded Khan has described Trump as ignorant, Trump shook his head and said: \u201cLet\u2019s do an IQ test.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s office hotly rejected the idea, saying \u201cignorance is not the same thing as lack of intelligence.\u201d', u'Donald Trump denies he\u2019s at war with new London Mayor Sadiq KhanLONDON \u2013 Presidential candidate Donald Trump says he may have a poor relationship with British Prime Minister David Cameron in light of his criticism of Trump\u2019s call for all Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the United States.Trump\u2019s comments, broadcast Monday on ITV\u2019s \u201cGood Morning Britain,\u201d are certain to cause unease in Britain, where America is seen as the country\u2019s closest ally.

But often information is blacked out, prompting complaints to the commissioner.Currently the commissioner, an ombudsman for users of the access law, can investigate complaints and recommend that records be released. But she cannot force a government agency to do so, and must head to court to pursue the matter further.Provincial commissioners in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edward Island have the power to order the release of government information. Many openness advocates have called for the federal commissioner to have similar authority.The Liberals recently included the proposal in a basket of changes to be introduced in legislation later this year or early next.As part of an online consultation on the proposals, the government notes some jurisdictions have combined order-making powers for the commissioner with the principle of ministerial responsibility.The notion the Liberals would even raise the possibility of a ministerial override alarmed the British Columbia Freedom of Information and Privacy Association.\u201cWe think this is a bad idea,\u201d the association\u2019s executive director, Vincent Gogolek, recently told a House of Commons committee studying the access law.Gogolek says the ministerial override model has led to a number of abuses in Britain, including the so-called Black Spider Memos controversy involving Prince Charles.In that case, England\u2019s attorney general vetoed the release of letters and memos to the Guardian newspaper that the Prince of Wales had written to various ministers over the years, a decision that was eventually overturned in the courts.Duff Conacher, a founder of the group Democracy Watch, told the Commons committee that information may reasonably be off-limits to requesters when it deals with sensitive areas such as the defence of Canada, law enforcement, national security or personal matters.But the information commissioner should have the right to decide whether an exemption applies \u201cin every single case,\u201d Conacher said. If the government disagrees, it could appeal to the courts, he added.The final shape of the government\u2019s proposal on the information commissioner\u2019s powers could depend on recommendations from the committee.In outlining the federal proposals for access reform, Treasury Board President Scott Brison said that while the government had made certain commitments, he was open to hearing what MPs had to say.\u201cWe will be taking seriously all the recommendations of this committee.\u201d', u'Maxime Bernier launches Tory leadership campaign before crowded houseSAINTE MARIE DE BEAUCE, Que. \u2013 Quebec MP Maxime Bernier has officially launched his campaign to become the Conservative party\u2019s next leader.Bernier told a packed stadium in his home riding of Beauce this morning that he would run a small government if elected.He also said he would lower taxes and make more efforts to pay down the debt.While Bernier, 53, and are the only official candidates for the party\u2019s top job, they likely won\u2019t be alone.Ontario MP Michael Chong has scheduled a news conference for Monday where he is expected to enter the race.READ MORE:Other Tories said to be contemplating a run for the leadership include Tony Clement and Lisa Raitt.The Conservatives will vote for a new leader on May 27, 2017.', u'Transcript Season 5 Episode 35Episode 35, Season 5Sunday, May 15, 2016\xa0: Tom Clark: Mark Holland, Scott Reid, Nathan Cullen,  Sajjan: Catherine McKenna: Ottawa\xa0  Well, Canada is maybe one step closer to a whole new way of voting. The government has struck a committee to find alternatives to the current first-past-the-post system. And it\u2019s promised it will be in place for the next election in 2019. The Opposition parties say the move is unfair, self-interested, and above all else, undemocratic.And joining me now is the Parliamentary Secretary for Democratic Reform, Mark Holland, and the two Opposition critics, Scott Reid of the Conservative Party and Nathan Cullen of the NDP. Welcome to you all. Great to be here.: I want to start with you, Mark. You\u2019ve stacked the committee, the Liberals have a majority. You\u2019ve virtually ruled out a referendum on the outcome. Haven\u2019t you poisoned the well before this thing\u2019s even started?: No, I don\u2019t accept that at all. I think that first of all, the House of Commons ultimately, and every member in it, is going to make this decision. Whether or not the committee was comprised entirely of Opposition members or if it was any other constitution, it still has to come back to the body, the House of Commons. So we\u2019re going to have to work as members to make this work and find what that compromise is and make sure that when it gets back to the House we have a system that is going to modernize our electoral system.: Okay, but on the basis of that system, a lot of people would say look, you\u2019re preferred system as the party of the middle, is a preferential ballot, a ranked ballot system, and that by stacking the committee making that perhaps the inevitable outcome, because that\u2019s what the committee will vote for, isn\u2019t the process designed in such a way to get exactly what you want, that one system preferential ballot which is the only one incidentally that would help the Liberal Party?: Well Tom, I mean to be very clear, our caucus is very divided on this. I mean you look at St\xe9phane Dion and a number of other ministers who are big proponents of other systems over proportional representation. We have other members who favour the system that you mentioned and I\u2019ve got other colleagues who favour other systems we\u2019re not even talking about. So there is an enormous diversity of opinion. But here is where there is consistency: Canadians made a very clear decision, more than 60 per cent voted to say\u2026 of four parties that said we had to end first-past-the-post. They said that the system that we have, the challenges that we have with our democratic system means that we need change and so the status quo isn\u2019t an option. And right now, frankly, what would we have a question on? I mean the Conservatives have given no proposals whatsoever to what they would change the system to. So what I would say is let\u2019s work collaboratively, let\u2019s work together. Let\u2019s engage Canadians on a pan-Canadian basis on the talk about what the options are and about how we can improve the system. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dedicated to.: Okay, but let me go to Scott Reid on this one because let me put it to you this way. Scott, is there any type of electoral reform that would help your party other than keeping the first-past-the-post system which is what we\u2019ve got now?: You know I\u2019d have to think about that. I mean one of the things we discussed before this discussion began on air was the fact that parties change their policies and they attempt to change their appeal when you have a new system, so it\u2019s actually hard to say what system would be best to which party, although I do think you\u2019re right that single member rank ballots does systematically favour the centrist party. And that favours the Liberals.: Because they\u2019d always be the second choice, the left and the right.: As long as they can stay in the centre, but I think\u2014I don\u2019t know what the case would be 10, 15 years from now, but in 2019 they are likely to be the centrist party. But actually in terms of other parties, I am less certain about which system favours which party. But this makes a key point which is so we all want to figure out this thing. We are politicians; it\u2019s our job to get elected. The only way to get around this problem is to design a system by whatever means and then take that system and put it before the Canadian voters because the Canadian voters will not accept a system that is stacked in favour of any party.: So what proposals would you put in front of the Canadian public? What do you want to change? I mean what about the status quo, don\u2019t you like and what would you change?: Well, I think the answer here, Mark, is this, you were elected on a mandate and I think it\u2019s a legitimate mandate to go out and seek new alternatives and your government\u2019s responsibility. You are the government is to go out there and find an alternative and then put it before the Canadian people and say do you like this or do you prefer the status quo\u2013?[crosstalk]: The point is, that in the end, whatever system goes forward, it has to be something that the Canadian people approve\u2014: Let me get Nathan in here.: And this comes back to your very first question, Tom, which is about the credibility of the process that\u2019s put in front of us in which the Liberals dominate this committee by the votes that are there. Mark alluded that there\u2019s different opinions within the Liberal caucus. Well there\u2019s one opinion that perhaps stands out as maybe a little stronger than your average Liberal backbencher and that\u2019s Justin Trudeau, who for years has said this is that preferential ballot system that pushes parties towards the middle is the one he likes. That all aside, we just went through listening to the Liberal rhetoric about wanting to work together and I like Mark a lot and want to do that because this is an incredible opportunity for us. A historic opportunity, particularly for New Democrats. Electoral reform is a huge issue for our people, for our membership and for me personally, so let\u2019s get at that. But the committee designed, the government had a choice. We gave them options. They asked for ideas, we gave them an idea in which the committee would actually reflect how people voted in the last election because the Liberals agree with us in saying that the current system is broken. It allows a government to form with less than 40 per cent support in the country. So the Liberals go that. They got less than 40 per cent. But on the committee, they\u2019ve got 60 per cent of the seats and so you say well, why use a broken system to fix this and use the same model of that broken system and hope that something gets better. And I really do believe this, if the Liberals had taken up our proposal, this whole idea that the thing is stacked, that it\u2019s rigged, that the Liberals are going to give what they want, I think would have been diminished greatly because they wouldn\u2019t have had the ability to push anything through on their own.: Nathan, let me pick up on this though because as much as Liberal supporters like the rank ballot system because that aids the middle, a lot of your NDP supporters like the idea of proportional representation because it means that you would greater representation in the House. So you\u2019re talking about two different systems. And Scott in your case, the whole idea of a referendum, it passed as prologue, every time electoral reform has gone to a referendum in this county it\u2019s been defeated.: That\u2019s actually not true. So in 2005, in British Columbia, 57 per cent of people voted in favour of the threshold.: The threshold was 60.: An artificial 60 per cent threshold, but\u2014: Well, whatever it was, but it failed.: But had it been 50 per cent would have gone through and I advocate a 50 per cent threshold.: My point is though that because the Conservatives don\u2019t have a position on either proportional representation or the rank ballot, all you want is a referendum. It certainly seems to a lot of people that that is the most efficient way of killing the whole idea of electoral reform because it doesn\u2019t help the Conservative Party.: No, in New Zealand, the people voted in favour of changing the system. There are examples in history, numerous examples of referendums successfully bringing through electoral reform. Switzerland in 1919 voted for electoral reforms\u2014: But Ontario, B.C. and P.E.I. in Canada are a different story.: But you know, hang on, hang on\u2014This brings the point though, if I could Tom.: In P.E.I. they\u2019re having another referendum. The first one was rejected, they\u2019re going back to do it again. So the views are being refined to reflect where the values of P.E.I. voters are.[crosstalk]: I mean look, the reality is it\u2019d be one thing if the Conservatives were coming forward and they had a clear proposal and they\u2019d worked with us and they said you know what? This proposal is a meaningful improvement to the status quo. Let\u2019s go have a referendum on this. But they\u2019re not saying that. They\u2019re saying we have no ideas, we\u2019re not offering any new system and they want to have a referendum, I don\u2019t know on what? And what I\u2019m saying is this is a premature discussion. What we need to do is to engage Canadians from 338 ridings, make sure that they have an opportunity to have input. In a very real way, and Nathan and Scott and I have a lot of discussions. I want to hear their ideas. I want to see if we can find compromise because if we can find consensus, if we can find the middle ground, then frankly, if you can get the population behind it then that\u2019s a moot point.: Here\u2019s a question, we just went through this with assisted dying, that whole panel that got setup, the parties worked together. Even the Liberal chair can\u2019t vote for the bill because the Liberals took their numbers on the committee and defeated virtually every amendment the Opposition brought forward on an incredibly important issue to many Canadians about end of life, and then in the House of Commons then in vote closure to shut down the debate on this. So the words could\u2014[crosstalk]Allow me this, I didn\u2019t interrupt you. I didn\u2019t interrupt. Allow me this that the words are nice, but the actions have been different on that first test. This one\u2019s even more foundational and it says how do we vote? The government has yet to confirm that whatever this committee does, will the cabinet just accept our recommendation or will Mr. Trudeau make a different recommendation to the Parliament? We don\u2019t even have that confirmation from the government yet.: Okay, this is just the beginning of many, many discussions that we\u2019re going to have around this table. Probably one of the most important political discussions we\u2019ve had in this country in a very long time. I thank you very much, Scott Reid, Nathan Cullen and Mark Holland, thanks very much for being part of the conversation.And still to come, a carbon neutral \u2018Plane Talk\u2019 with Environment Minister Catherine McKenna. But first, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan with an update on our mission against ISIS, that\u2019s next.\xa0[Break]\xa0: Welcome back. Well two months ago, the government changed Canada\u2019s mission against ISIS in Iraq. The air bombardment is over but there are more Canadian boots on the ground. So far, there have been no Canadian casualties, but a number of questions have been raised. Late last week, I spoke to Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan from NORAD headquarters in Colorado Springs.Minister Sajjan, good to have you back on the show. You know, I noticed just a couple of moments ago down there in Colorado you were talking to the Secretary of Defence Ash Carter and, you know, publicly he\u2019s been saying that he\u2019s asking all the allies what more they can do in the fight against the Islamic State. Have we sort of reached our limit in terms of what we can do, or have we got more to give?: Oh in fact, not only am I here with Ash Carter here in NORAD, but just last week we were at the Counter-ISIL meeting where 11 of us, of the largest contributing nations, got together to get an update and decide the way forward. There are a lot of asks in terms of the gaps that we need to fill in the coalition. Fortunately for us Canadians, we had recently announced our contribution and as our force flow is happening, the commanders on the ground are extremely pleased with the trainers and especially our intelligence assets that we have put into place. As we move forward, there are other aspects of capabilities that we will need from other nations. And as we complete our force flow by summertime, we will also, as I\u2019ve always said, assess the situation and if there is a need, Canada will consider it.: Okay, I want to talk specifically about the mission now because recently you authorized some media coverage of our participation there. And it sort of raised a few questions, not the least of which was that the Special Operations Forces were identified. They were filmed, pictures were taken of them. And I\u2019m just wondering at a time when the Americans are warning their soldiers about being identified because of the threat that ISIS has made that they will attack their families back in the United States once they\u2019re identified, why on earth did we allow this identity to take place?: The Canadian Armed Forces take the security of our personnel extremely seriously and at the same time, we feel that Canadians do have a necessity to understand what the Canadian Armed Forces is doing. And I give full flexibility to the Canadian Armed Forces down through the chain of command to be able to make the decisions when it\u2019s appropriate to talk to media in terms of what are security risks. But I want Canadians to know and I want our troops to be able to have interviews with the media, to be able to talk about the great work that they do. And in this case, with the chief of defence staff going into Iraq, they did a thorough security assessment and allowed some of the pictures to be released. But every single picture and how it\u2019s done, it goes through a strict process to making sure that our troops aren\u2019t being put at risk and I trust the chain of command, especially General Vance who has tremendous experience in this from his time in combat operations in Afghanistan and to always look at the safety of our security of our personnel and it was always met.: But you know, it wasn\u2019t that long ago, in fact, it was literally a few months ago that the Pentagon put out a warning about this to soldiers who are putting their pictures on social media because there was a specific threat from ISIS that they said we will go to your families and slaughter your families back home. But when this happened before minister, under the Harper government, if you remember everybody remembers the time they went over and shot pictures of Special Forces. I just want to play you what your colleague, Marc Garneau, had to say in the House of Commons when that took place. Have a listen to Marc Garneau.: So I guess the point is there Marc Garneau was saying that it placed the soldiers at risk. Now you\u2019re saying they\u2019re not at risk. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s changed?: No, the difference in this case is and there\u2019s a very distinct difference here, is those pictures that were released did not go through the appropriate process. These pictures, it was a chief of defence staff who went to Iraq at that time and it went through their appropriate process before those pictures were released. The pictures in question that were discussed in the past did not go through the Canadian Armed Forces process and that\u2019s the distinct difference. I trust when it comes to the safety and the security of the personnel, the chain of command takes it extremely seriously and I give them the trust to be able to make those right decisions.: But do you think that ISIS cares much whether it went through the right process or not?: When it comes to ISIL or any threat into Canada and especially to our Canadian Armed Forces, we evaluate that threat on a daily basis. In fact, not just from a Canadian perspective, even by breaking down into regions from our bases to our force posture of our personnel all over the world. It\u2019s continually assessed and the decisions for force protection are delegated right down and the chief of defence staff is ultimately responsible for that. And I have had regular discussions about this because this is one thing we take extremely seriously. And if there\u2019s a change, he informs me quite directly. But as you know, we\u2019re not going to be advertising any of those changes we\u2019re talking about the threats because we don\u2019t want ISIL or any other terrorist organization to understand what our force protection posture is.: Minister Sajjan, always good having you on the show and I appreciate your time today. Thanks so much.: Great, thank you.: Well coming up next, \u2018Plane Talk\u2019 with Environment Minister Catherine McKenna.\xa0[Break]\xa0: Welcome back. Catherine McKenna is the only MP who gets to work in her riding every day. She\u2019s the MP for Ottawa Centre which happens to include Parliament Hill. She also heads up one of the key ministries in the Trudeau government, environment and climate change. Here\u2019s \u2018Plane Talk\u2019 with a bit of a green twist:\xa0***\xa0 You ready?: I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s rock and roll. Okay, this is pretty awesome.: Well we\u2019re only a few feet off the ground.: It\u2019s still pretty awesome.: Okay. Catherine McKenna, good to have you on \u2018Plane Talk.\u2019: I\u2019m very excited to be here.: So this is your riding.: I know! It\u2019s Ottawa Centre. How awesome, all the doors I knocked on, I can pick them out.: Now did that polling station move for you or against you because there are things we can do.: [Chuckles] No, a lot of them voted for me. [Laughs]: So you\u2019re basically the Honourable Member from Parliament Hill because Parliament Hill is in your riding.: Yeah.: Does it ever seem like a fishbowl to you? I mean do you live and work in exactly the same place?: [Chuckling] It is a fishbowl. Actually, you know what? What\u2019s the saying when you get 100 metres outside of Parliament Hill, it\u2019s totally different. When you knock on doors around here, the issues that you think are really important and when you\u2019re in Parliament are a little bit different. But it\u2019s a great riding.: Have you ever seen it from this perspective before?: No. I see my house. [Laughs]: Inevitably, and you\u2019ve talked about this openly, there\u2019s a real push-pull in terms of family and work and especially the work that you do now. Do you think you\u2019ve resolved that to your satisfaction?C: I wish. You know what? It\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s not just hard for politicians; it\u2019s for working parents generally. I have said that I\u2019m going to try to always be home for dinner for a few hours because I have to reconnect with the kids and the family and have they done their homework and getting something decent to eat. But it\u2019s challenging.: You know before you went into politics, you were very involved in a number of NGOs, a lot of them with a legal bend to them. Did you want the portfolio of environment?: You know when the prime minister asked me, I almost fell off my chair. I mean I was so excited, but it was a surprise. But you know what? There could not be a better portfolio. The thing is it has a legal aspect; we were in big negotiations as you know for the Paris agreement. It\u2019s really also the most important issue that we face globally and my kids get it and they\u2019re excited about it.: With the type of schedule that you\u2019ve got, what do you do to turn off and relax?: Actually, I started doing masters swimming competitively. But now I\u2019m not that competitive [chuckles], but there is a parliamentary swim team every Thursday when the House sits. And it\u2019s great, its non-partisan, Elizabeth May and I in our bathing suits hanging out. She\u2019s watching out, giving me some advice [chuckles] that\u2019s great.: What do you want to do ultimately in politics? What do you want that legacy item to be that you brought to the table?: You know it\u2019s serious action on climate change and honestly, I can get really quite emotional about it because it is such a big challenge.: Do you want to stay in politics for a long time?: I\u2019m not someone who would probably stay in politics forever. I want to make my mark and do my part. It\u2019s hard on the family.: Would you ever want to be prime minister?: Oh my God. [Laughs] Is that what you ask everyone? Oh, I want to be\u2014I want to do a damn good job in what I\u2019m doing right now.: There were a lot of people who said that you wouldn\u2019t win.: There were a lot of people.: Yeah, and you got angry about that.: I didn\u2019t get angry, it was just when you\u2019re running and people say hey you\u2019d be a good representative but you can\u2019t win, it makes it harder to win because people think you can\u2019t win. But you know when the best moment really was? It wasn\u2019t when I won. It actually was around 8 o\u2019clock at night when I was pulling votes\u2014it was an election day and I was with Yasir Naqvi, so our MPP, and we hit the last door and we tried to do a high-five. We kind of missed and I was just laughing. And I thought look, I put it all on the table. My team has put it all on the table, if we don\u2019t win, so what. You can\u2019t regret things and in life, I\u2019m not someone who really regrets things. I would never have regretted running. I mean obviously it\u2019s incredible to win and be in the position I\u2019m in, but it was really great.: Climate change is probably one of those things that is bigger than most people think. I mean already you\u2019re hitting some headwinds in terms of how much this is going to cost and how much it\u2019s going to disrupt life. How are you dealing with that?: I\u2019m a realist in life, a realistic optimist as I like to say. It\u2019s hard, that things that are important can be hard and I think Canadians expect serious action and there\u2019s also real opportunity.: So that\u2019s the Ottawa River and\u2014: I told you I swam across, eh? For the Ottawa River: You swam across the Ottawa River?: Yeah, well they do a swim every year. You swim from Quebec to Ontario to make the point that rivers don\u2019t stop at boundaries and we all have to work together to keep the river clean.: So thank you for joining me on \u2018Plane Talk\u2019.: It was amazing. Thank you so much for having me up. You know, you probably know I\u2019m always looking at how we can reduce emissions and unfortunately, you know that I have to fly. And today, this was a real opportunity to get up here, but we\u2019re working internationally on aviation sectors, so how we can be much more efficient. But also, by carbon offsets is one way you can do it. So here we go, recognizing Tom Clark and we bought some offsets for this flight.: Well that\u2019s lovely.: Yeah.: Well that\u2019s the first time anybody\u2019s bought me carbon offsets.: [Laughs]: Well that\u2019s our show for today. I\u2019m Tom Clark. We\u2019re going to leave you now with some images of the Tulip Festival here in Ottawa which kicked off last week. Have a great week ahead.', u"\u2018Plane Talk\u2019 with Catherine McKenna: On her best election day memory and Canada\u2019s green futureCatherine McKenna is among 338 MPs currently sitting in the House of Commons but she\u2019s the only one who goes to work almost every day in her own riding.Canada\u2019s environment minister is the MP for Ottawa Centre, which includes Parliament Hill. She recently took to the skies with The West Block\u2019s Tom Clark, and got a chance to see her riding from the air.\u201cAll the doors I knocked on, I can pick them out,\u201d she joked.Door knocking was critical for McKenna during last year\u2019s federal election. Ottawa Centre was a hotly-contested riding, and few believed the lawyer-turned\xa0Liberal candidate\xa0could unseat popular NDP MP Paul Dewar.\u201cYou know when the best moment really was? It wasn\u2019t when I won,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cIt actually was around 8 o\u2019clock at night when I was pulling votes \u2014 it was an election day and I was with Yasir Naqvi, so our MPP, and we hit the last door and we tried to do a high-five. We kind of missed, and I was just laughing. And I thought, \u2018Look, I put it all on the table. My team has put it all on the table. If we don\u2019t win, so what?'\u201dMcKenna acknowledged that balancing her career and family life has become even more challenging, but said she\u2019s honoured to have been chosen to lead\xa0Canada\u2019s efforts to combat climate change.\u201cThere could not be a better portfolio. The thing is, it has a legal aspect; we were in big negotiations, as you know, for the Paris agreement. It\u2019s really also the most important issue that we face globally, and my kids get it and they\u2019re excited about it.\u201dWatch the full interview with McKenna above.", u'Pictures showing faces of special forces in Iraq followed protocol, says defence ministerImages of Canadian Special Forces troops in Iraq that were recently made public had been approved by the Canadian military, says Canada\u2019s defence minister, and they do not pose a danger to the men and women on the ground.Harjit Sajjan told The West Block\u2019s Tom Clark that there is a distinct difference between the images released as part of special media reports linked to Gen. Jonathan Vance\u2019s trip to Iraq last month, and those that were released as part of a former prime minister Stephen Harper\u2019s .\u201cThe pictures in question \u2026\xa0did not go through the Canadian Armed Forces process, and that\u2019s the distinct difference. I trust when it comes to the safety and the security of the personnel, the chain of command takes it extremely seriously.\u201dThe images of special forces that were broadcast and disseminated after Vance\u2019s visit had been pre-approved, Sajjan said, and the military is confident that they will not result in those people being targeted by the so-called Islamic State.Clark then asked if, in fact,\xa0ISIL really cares about whether images went through a vetting process or not when they identify and target specific soldiers seen on camera. The terror group has previously said it would target the families of American special operations\xa0soldiers it is able to identify.\u201cIt\u2019s continually assessed and the decisions for force protection are delegated right down, and the chief of defence staff is ultimately responsible for that. And I have had regular discussions about this, because this is one thing we take extremely seriously. And if there\u2019s a change, he informs me quite directly.\u201d\xa0', u'Even Liberals are divided on reforming Canada\u2019s voting system: Mark HollandThe Liberals may have a majority of seats on a new committee looking into changing how Canadians vote, but the party\u2019s parliamentary secretary for democratic reform says there\u2019s disagreement even within his own caucus about how to overhaul the system.Mark Holland joined Tom Clark in The West Block this weekend to talk about ending first-past-the-post by the time the next election rolls around in 2019. Holland said that while there\u2019s been criticism about the Liberals allegedly \u2018stacking the deck\u2019 in favour of whatever reform will favour them politically, Canadians might be surprised by the diversity of opinion within his party.\u201cI mean you look at St\xe9phane Dion and a number of other ministers who are big proponents of other systems over proportional representation. We have other members who favour the (ranked ballot system)\xa0and I\u2019ve got other colleagues who favour other systems we\u2019re not even talking about.\u201dPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has expressed his own opinion on electoral reform in the past, seemingly favouring ranked ballots because the Liberals, as a centrist party, would tend to be the second choice for many voters both on the left and the right.The NDP\u2019s Nathan Cullen and Conservative MP Scott Reid were also on hand to weigh in on the next steps. Cullen said he looks forward to working with other parties to come up with a plan for reform, but the government should have built a more balanced committee. The recent experience with assisted-dying legislation doesn\u2019t fill him with hope that the Liberals will accept all opinions, he added.Reid maintained that the Conservatives feel a referendum is necessary to determine the will of the Canadian people on the issue.\xa0', u'Thomas Mulcair \u2018unlikely\u2019 to run for office in 2019Thomas Mulcair may be on his way out of\xa0politics.In an , the Interim-NDP leader said it was unlikely he would run for MP in his riding of Outremont again.An NDP staffer confirmed Mulcair\u2019s comment to Global News Sunday morning, but said it would be up to Mulcair to provide the reasoning behind the decision.Mulcair has been head of the NDP since 2012. He was official leader of the Opposition before losing that status when Justin Trudeau and the Liberals took power after the federal election in October 2015.In the interview with La Presse, he said he remains convinced he had a substantial effect on ending the \u201creign of the Conservatives of Stephen Harper.\u201dThe council, made up of about 100 New Democrats from across\xa0Canada, is considered the party\u2019s governing body.A letter from central players in the party obtained by The\xa0Canadian Press noted the council should consider the competition\u2019s\xa0financial impact and highlighted the 2003 and 2012 leadership races\xa0both lasted eight months.', u'London\u2019s ex-mayor compares European Union to HitlerLONDON \u2014 Ex-London Mayor Boris Johnson has compared the European Union\u2019s aims to those of Adolf Hitler, arguing that the 28-nation bloc is creating a superstate that mirrors the attempt of the Nazi leader to dominate the European continent.Johnson, the most prominent political figure arguing that Britain should leave the EU, says the past 2,000 years of European history have been dominated by doomed attempts to unify the continent and recreate the Romans\u2019 golden age.\u201cNapoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,\u201d he was quoted by The Sunday Telegraph as saying. \u201cBut fundamentally, what is lacking is the eternal problem, which is that there is no underlying loyalty to the idea of Europe. There is no single authority that anybody respects or understands. That is causing this massive democratic void.\u201dJohnson\u2019s remarks immediately elicited outrage on the part of those campaigning to remain in the EU ahead of a June 23 vote in Britain on whether to stay or leave. The \u201cstay\u201d camp described Johnson\u2019s comments as a desperate effort take the focus off the economic impact such a rupture would create and on to the more populist theme of sovereignty issues.\u201cLeave campaigners have lost the economic argument and now they are losing their moral compass,\u201d said Hilary Benn, a senior member of the Labour Party.The remarks come after a steady drumbeat of economic warnings about the shock to the nation\u2019s economy in the event of a vote to leave. The Bank of England and its respected Gov. Mark Carney cautioned last week that Britain faces a recession amid the uncertainty of a so-called Brexit (British exit from the EU).By shifting to the sovereignty issue, Johnson is changing tack \u2013 and tapping into the deep-seated concerns of many Britons who believe that bureaucrats in Brussels have seized too much control over their everyday lives. By evoking World War II, Johnson has reminded much of the country of its \u201cfinest hour\u201d \u2013 the moment that the nation acted as the bulwark to halt Nazi tyranny.\xa0Johnson\u2019 attention-grabbing tactics have also underscored his ability tap into the popular mood, and his comments Sunday are likely to appeal to the patriotic sentiments of those who have not yet made up their minds on the vote. Johnson\u2019s self-deprecating manner and jokey persona often seizes the public\u2019s imagination \u2013 a factor that makes him a leading contender to succeed fellow Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, the leader of the \u201cstay\u201d campaign.Another leading figure in the \u201cout\u201d campaign, the nationalist UKIP party leader Nigel Farage, compared Johnson to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and rejected suggestions he wasn\u2019t serious enough to be Britain\u2019s prime minister.\u201cBoris goes on surprising people,\u201d Farage told the Mail on Sunday. \u201cThey say he can\u2019t do this, he\u2019s a joker \u2013 it\u2019s like Ronnie Reagan. Could he do it? Yes.\u201d\t\n\t']

[u'Trudeau satisfied with ransom promise by world leaders at G7 summitSHIMA, Japan \u2013 Justin Trudeau says he\u2019s encouraged by the pledges made Friday by his fellow  leaders in Japan, on both their renewed vow to stop paying ransoms for hostages and their approach to boosting the global economy.However, the ransom promise closely resembled a G7 pledge from three years ago, something experts say member countries didn\u2019t live up to.And on lifting the world\u2019s feeble economic growth, the G7 essentially pledged to continue with their own individual strategies.Heading into the summit, Trudeau had urged some of his more fiscally prudent counterparts to invest more government cash to generate growth.Still, while speaking to reporters in Shima, Japan, the prime minister said he felt the group moved forward significantly on a number of files during his first G7 summit.On the economy, he said there was a broad understanding that monetary and fiscal policy, as well as structural reforms, are all important for enhancing global growth.Each country will map out its own path, Trudeau noted.\u201cThe concerted approach is to use the levers available to each of our economies in as fulsome a way as possible to create growth.\u201dThe leaders vowed to use a more-balanced response to lift growth and agreed that monetary policy \u2013 such as benchmark interest rates \u2013 cannot alone create stronger, sustainable growth.The 32-page declaration did commit to fight protectionism and called the potential United Kingdom exit from the European Union a serious risk to growth \u2013 two positions Trudeau had publicly supported in recent days.\xa0Overall, the document touches on a range of subjects, including refugees, health, terrorism, security, climate, trade and the global economy.The content of the G7 stance against paying ransoms did not appear to go much further than the leaders\u2019 position on the same issue at a summit three years ago.In the document, the leaders said they \u201cunequivocally reiterate\u201d their resolve not to pay ransoms to terrorists.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a firm commitment does it?\u201d said David Welch, CIGI chair of global security at the Balsillie School of International Affairs.But Trudeau, who drove the issue of ransoms, was satisfied with the agreement.He said he felt that public opinion had shifted on the issue and more people around the world now understand that such payments are lucrative source of financing for terrorists.Trudeau also said the leaders recognize that paying ransoms puts other citizens more at risk.\u201cI expressed my firm resolve and the clear resolve of Canadians to prevent the Canadian flag from becoming a target when worn on a backpack around the world,\u201d he said.Trudeau said the leaders had a very strong conversation Thursday night around the G7 table about Canada\u2019s situation in the Philippines. It has made the issue of ransoms of important for Trudeau.Last month, Canadian hostage John Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf militants in the Philippines who had demanded a large sum of money in exchange for his release.Another Canadian, Robert Hall, was kidnapped by the same group and is still being held hostage in the Asian country.Earlier Friday, a Trudeau spokesman said he was pleased to find specific items on health and quality infrastructure mentioned in the closing G7 statement.Cameron Ahmad said Canada was encouraged that the communique highlighted an upcoming Global Fund conference in Montreal to raise cash to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.Global Fund raises an estimated US$4 billion every year as the world\u2019s main funding body in the fight to prevent and treat those diseases.\u201cWe are committed to ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, working in partnership with the Global Fund,\u201d the G7 statement said.It also called on new and traditional donors to support a replenishment of the fund.Earlier this month, Trudeau announced Canada would donate nearly $1 billion over two years toward the health initiative.\xa0', u'What you should know before helping your kids with a down paymentOTTAWA \u2013 Helping your children with a downpayment on their first home may be tempting, but financial advisers say to be sure to fully grasp how it will affect your own retirement planning before cutting a cheque.Kristine Skinner, financial adviser with BlueShore Financial in West Vancouver, B.C., says before deciding to help, parents need to understand how it will affect their own net worth and overall financial plan.\u201cI would love to see both the parent and the child in my office so that they both understand the implications and expectations for every scenario,\u201d Skinner says.\u201cWith the parent and the child being in here, we can go over different considerations of the complexity of what they are planning on doing and any of the risks associated with the purchase.\u201dA survey by the Bank of Montreal earlier this year found that 65 per cent of millennials said that they would rely, to some extent, on parents or other family members for financial assistance for as much as 10 per cent of the purchase price of their first home.Skinner says there are several options parents could consider if they want to help their children buy their first home.\u201cEvery parent and child or siblings are different, so it really is case-specific to your whole situation \u2014 there is no one answer for everybody\u201d she says.You can give the money to your children as a gift, a plan of action that could require a letter confirming the cash is indeed a gift that they are able to show their potential lenders. Or you could lend them the money, which would also need to be disclosed, including the repayment requirements.How you come up with the cash for a gift can vary. If you don\u2019t have the cash on hand, you could cash out part of your portfolio or borrow the money.\u201cYou want to have an in-depth conversation with your children about what their monthly budget looks like and their ability to absorb any unforeseen expenses and ensure that they\u2019ve actually built that into their budget before agreeing to help them.\u201dIf generous parents opt to sell stocks or mutual funds to help their kids come up with the money, they could face a hefty tax bill depending on the amount. If they borrow they money, they won\u2019t have that problem, but will be charged interest and need to be sure that they have a plan to pay it back.Skinner said parents could also sign as a guarantor on their child\u2019s mortgage.But if choosing that path, she added, \u201cit is very important for the parent to really trust their child.\u201dHelping a child acquire more than the 20 per cent threshold for a downpayment could help save them thousands, because they will not need the government-mandated mortgage default insurance.Jason Hunt, manager of personal finance at Alterna Savings and Credit Union in Ottawa, said the amount a homebuyer could save by not needing that insurance could add up to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the size of the mortgage.But you also don\u2019t want your children to buy more house than they can afford. Mortgage payments are only part of the cost of homeownership. Property taxes, utilities, insurance, strata fees, maintenance costs and emergency repairs all add up.\xa0Skinner also notes that if you want to help your children buy their first home and you have more than one child, you should have a plan in place to ensure everyone is treated fairly.\u201cSome people may have it documented in their will that their son was given so much money and therefore they get that less out of the inheritance,\u201d she said.', u'Gawker may be looking to sell after losing costly Hulk Hogan caseThe embattled online media company Gawker Media has hired an investment banker to explore its options, including a possible sale.Two months ago, Gawker lost a $140 million invasion-of-privacy suit against  over a sex tape of the wrestler that the site posted online.It emerged this week that Silicon Valley  was behind the suit.He told  that he has bankrolled lawyers to mount cases against Gawker because one of the company\u2019s blogs, the now-defunct Valleywag, posted a story in 2007 that said he was gay.The company also wrote other articles that he said he considered critical of his friends and others.Gawker said Thursday that it expects to prevail in an appeal of the Hogan verdict and that it\u2019s always said it is exploring contingency plans.The company would not say when the banker, Mark Patricof of Houlihan Lokey, was hired, other than to say \u201crecently.\u201d The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post earlier reported that Gawker was interested in a sale.Gawker hasn\u2019t said whether it could afford to pay the $140 million verdict. During the trial in Florida in March, Hogan\u2019s lawyer said Gawker Media\u2019s gross revenue in 2015 was $48.7 million. Lawyers said the company was worth $83 million.', u'5 reasons oil prices are risingTORONTO \u2013 Benchmark oil prices averaged below US$35 per barrel in the first three months of this year . What\u2019s driving the rally in West Texas Intermediate and other types of crude? Put simply, it\u2019s supply and demand.Here are five reasons that oil prices are strengthening:1) U.S. oil production is down. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that crude oil production in the United States fell to 8.77 million barrels per day, the lowest in 20 months. Producers have spent less to replace depleted reserves. Crude inventories are also down.2) Wildfires near Alberta\u2019s oilsands have reduced Canadian output. Calgary analyst Martin King of FirstEnergy Capital says he now estimates a total of 700,000 barrels per day of oilsands output will still be offline next week and the cumulative loss in production to May 30 will be roughly 28 million barrels. He expects the price impact to linger \u201cwell into June.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\t3) International oil supplies disrupted. Attacks by militants in Nigeria have cut output there to a 20-year low. Meanwhile, Venezuelan production has been hit by power cuts.4) Oil demand is stronger than expected. Gasoline demand in the United States rose to 9.6 million barrels per day last week compared with 9.2 million in the same week a year ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as Americans take to the roads to enjoy prices at the pump that are 20 per cent lower than a year ago.5) Iran\u2019s influence on prices has been muted. When exports resumed in January after an embargo was lifted, most analysts expected prices to fall. That hasn\u2019t happened despite the country ramping up to over two million barrels per day.', u'Oil surges past $50 for first time in 7 monthsThe price of oil broke through the $50 a barrel barrier Thursday morning for the first time in seven months.U.S. crude traded as high as US$50.21\xa0after the U.S. government reported a larger-than-expected drop in fuel stockpiles for last week.In Europe, Brent crude \u2013 which is used to price international oils \u2014 cracked the $50 mark as well.But prices settled back below that mark a couple of hours later. By noon ET, West Texas crude was trading at US$49.67.Oil prices have been rising steadily in 2016 after hitting a 14-year low of around $26 a barrel in February.The surge in prices today is helping to push up oil-based currencies, like the Canadian dollar. This morning, it was trading at 77.19 cents US, up four-tenths of a cent from Wednesday\u2019s close. By noon, the dollar was trading at just under 77.1 cents US.As well, global stock markets were mostly higher on\xa0Thursday in reaction to oil\u2019s steady rise.\u201cThis move does appear to have been coming for the\xa0last couple of weeks, the question now is whether it can establish\xa0itself in a new range between $50 and $55,\u201d said Craig Erlam,\xa0senior market analyst at OANDA. \u201cWhile supply disruptions are\xa0likely to continue to support prices for now, a further\xa0strengthening in the dollar over the next couple of months could act\xa0as something of a counterweight and keep prices in check.\u201dEarlier this month, oil hit fresh highs for the year due in part to unrest in Nigeria and the . In Nigeria, attacks by militants in Niger Delta region cut the country\u2019s daily output by 800,000 barrels.In Alberta, oilsands production came to a near standstill as the Fort McMurray wildfire forced tens of thousands of people to flee the city and nearby oilsands camps.\u2014\xa0', u'Living with parents until mid 30s more common than everWASHINGTON \u2013 Many of America\u2019s young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.For the first time on record, living with parents is now the most common arrangement for people ages 18 to 34, an analysis of census data by the\xa0 has found.And the proportion of older millennials \u2014 those ages 25 to 34 \u2014 who are living at home has reached its highest point (19 per cent) on record, Pew analysts said.Nearly one-third of all American millennials live with their parents, slightly more than the proportion who live with a spouse or partner. It\u2019s the first time that living at home has outpaced living with a spouse for this age group since such record-keeping began in 1880.The remaining young adults are living alone, with other relatives, in college dorms, as roommates or under other circumstances.More than 40 per cent of Canadians aged 20 to 29 also lived at home with their parents at last count.The sharp shift across the continent reflects a long-running decline in marriage, amplified by the economic upheavals of the recession.The trend has been particularly evident among Americans who lack a college degree.The pattern may be a contributing factor in the sluggish growth of the U.S. economy, which depends heavily on consumer spending. With more young people living with their parents rather than on their own, fewer people need to buy appliances, furniture or cable subscriptions. The recovery from the 2008-09 recession has been hobbled by historically low levels of home construction and home ownership.Jennifer Post, 26, has been living with her parents in Villas, New Jersey, since dropping out of law school two years ago.A law career wasn\u2019t a good fit for her, Post decided, and now she\u2019s seeking a job in digital media or marketing. There aren\u2019t many opportunities in Villas, a beach town.Even living at home, she said it\u2019s been hard to save for a move to a bigger city after she was laid off from a baking job in March.Post spends her days on her laptop, sending resumes and refreshing LinkedIn and other job sites. To her parents, it looks as though she\u2019s slacking off.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a generation gap,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they literally think I just sit down and watch Netflix all day.\u201dAs recently as 2000, nearly 43 per cent of young adults ages 18 to 34 were married or living with a partner. By 2014, that proportion was just 31.6 per cent.In 2000, only 23 per cent of young adults were living with parents. In 2014, the figure reached 32.1 per cent.The proportion of young adults living with their parents is similar to the proportions that prevailed from 1880 through 1940, when the figure peaked, Pew found. Yet in those decades, the most common arrangement for young adults was living with a spouse rather than with parents.The typical U.S. woman now marries at 27.1 years old, the typical man at 29.2, according to census data. That\u2019s up from record lows of 20.1 for women and 22.5 for men in 1956.\u201cThey\u2019re concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children,\u201d Fry said.The shift may also be disrupting the housing market. One mystery that\u2019s confounded analysts is why there aren\u2019t more homes for sale. The lack of available houses has driven up prices and made it less affordable for many would-be purchasers to buy.Nela Richardson, chief economist at real estate brokerage Redfin, says one explanation for the sparse supply is that many baby boomers aren\u2019t able to sell their family homes and downsize for retirement because they still have adult children living with them. Redfin surveyed homeowners ages 55 to 64 and found that one-fifth still have adult children at home.Among young men, declining employment and falling wages are another factor keeping many 18-to-34-year-olds unmarried, Fry said. The share of young men with jobs fell to 71 per cent in 2014 from 84 per cent in 1960 \u2014 the year when the proportion of young adults living outside the home peaked.Incomes have fallen, too: Wages, adjusted for inflation, plunged 34 per cent for the typical young man from 2000 to 2014.Other factors contributing to more millennials living with parents range from rising apartment rents to heavy student-debt loads to longer periods in college.Many analysts had expected that as the economy improved, younger adults would increasingly move out on their own. That hasn\u2019t happened. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says soaring rents are discouraging some from leaving their parents\u2019 homes.Kolko\u2019s research has found that the share of young adults living with parents in the first quarter of 2016 was essentially unchanged from two years earlier.Median rents nationwide were surging at a 6 per cent annual pace as recently as August, though they have slowed since. In fast-growing cities like San Francisco, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, rents rose last year at a double-digit pace.Heavier student debt loads have sent more young people back to their parents\u2019 nests, according to research by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Other economists aren\u2019t convinced that student debt plays a dominant role. They note that the proportion of young adults without college degrees who live with parents is especially high: Nearly 39 per cent of those with only a high school degree were living with a parent in 2014, up from around 26 per cent in 2000.That compares with just 19 per cent of young adult college grads living at home in 2014. That figure, though, is up sharply from 11 per cent in 2000.Still, economists say most millennials appear to be delaying, rather than avoiding, marriage.Casey Marshella moved back in with her parents in Fairfield, Connecticut, after graduating from Boston University last year. Just this week, she moved into an apartment with her sister. Within weeks, she and a friend \u2014 who also lives with her parents \u2014 expect to find their own place.Marshella, 22, says living at home has helped her save money from her job as a human resources specialist. Because many people her age share the same circumstances, most sympathize with her.Still, Marshella says their first question is usually, \u201cSo when are you planning on moving out?\u201d', u'What are the cheapest places for Canadians to fly? (Hint: not in Canada)We all know flying within Canada isn\u2019t cheap. Well it turns out Canadian cities don\u2019t even crack\xa0the top 10 when it comes to\xa0airfare affordability.Air Canada\u2019s CEO Calin Rovinescu said on Wednesday that\xa0Canada\u2019s airport fees are too high, just as a\xa0travel report released by \xa0found the 10 most affordable flights in\xa0Canada are all to U.S. destinations.The search site\u2019s number crunching is based on results\xa0from six Canadian cities\xa0\u2014\xa0, , , ,  and  \u2014 between May 1, 2015\xa0and\xa0April 30, 2016.On average, travelers in those cities are\xa0most likely to get the best round-trip deals when booking to:Florida hotspots (Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa)\xa0round out the next three spots on the list, followed by Los Angeles ($458) and Phoenix ($461).For those who want to keep their vacation north of the border,\xa0Montreal is the cheapest Canadian destination.

That could reduce the ability of the front brakes to stop the trucks.The company reports nine crashes with no injuries, but one person was hurt in an unspecified interaction with the brakes.Dealers will replace the brake master cylinder for free. They\u2019ll also replace the brake booster if they find leaks from the master cylinder.', u'Just shy of $1B: Loan losses trim BMO\u2019s Q2 profitsTORONTO \u2013 In what could be a harbinger of things to come, the Bank of Montreal has announced that its second quarter profit fell to $973 million, down three per cent from a year ago, as it took bigger provisions for credit losses and restructuring expenses.The bank reported $999 million of net income during the same quarter last year.The earnings amounted to $1.45 per share, down from $1.49 per share a year ago.BMO is the first of the big banks to report second quarter earnings.BMO\u2019s net income included a $132 million restructuring charge related to technological changes and $201 million in provisions for credit losses, both higher than in last year\u2019s second quarter.On an adjusted basis, BMO earned $1.152 billion, or $1.73 per share, up from $1.146 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year ago.Revenue increased to $5.10 billion, from $4.53 billion during the second quarter of last year.BMO also announced its quarterly dividend will go up by two cents to 86 cents per share, effective Aug. 26, 2016.', 'TransCanada ordered to clean up Keystone XL pipeline construction sitesThe National Energy Board says it has ordered TransCanada Corp. to clean up sites that were developed as part of the Keystone XL pipeline project.While inspecting sites in Alberta, the NEB found that TransCanada (TSX:TRP) had not yet completed reclamation at two drill site staging areas.The areas include a section of the pipeline right-of-way and construction access roads at the Red Deer River and the South Saskatchewan River crossings.The NEB issued the company a non-compliance order related to a lack of erosion control and weed management at the sites.The order requires TransCanada to submit environmental surveys, monitoring and consultation reports and details of the reclamation scenarios by the end of the year.The U.S. government denied TransCanada a permit to go ahead with the U.S. section of the pipeline last November.', u'Japan\u2019s Prime Minister ups pressure on Trudeau over TPPTOKYO \u2013 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe upped the pressure Tuesday on Justin Trudeau by publicly suggesting his Canadian counterpart\u2019s positions had budged on a pair of prickly international files.Following a bilateral meeting with the visiting Canadian prime minister in Tokyo, Abe read a statement to reporters saying the two leaders shared \u201cserious concern\u201d about the territorial dispute that involved the \u201cbuilding of outposts\u201d in the South China Sea.Abe also said, through an interpreter, that Japan would continue to make efforts to seek early ratification of the controversial  treaty \u2014 \u201ctogether with Canada.\u201dBut Canada\u2019s interpretation of the meeting was somewhat different on those two issues.\t\t\t\n\t\tTrudeau initially made no mention of the contentious South China Sea dispute in remarks Tuesday that followed Abe\u2019s. As for the TPP, the government has made clear it is taking its time to review the 12-country Pacific Rim trade agreement before deciding to ratify.Japan is embroiled in an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea. China has been constructing islands despite the concerns of several Asian countries with territorial claims in the area.Last winter, Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida issued a statement confirming their commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in international maritime law.Without naming China, they also said they opposed the use of intimidation, force or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific.Late Tuesday, Trudeau spokeswoman Kate Purchase said in an email that \u201cthere is no change in our position on the South China Sea.\u201d She reiterated Canada\u2019s position, saying: \u201cAs we have said consistently, we believe in the rule of law and discourage any unilateral actions.\u201dKeio University law professor Masayuki Tadokoro said Abe may have been trying to \u201cextract\u201d extra support from Trudeau on an issue that represents a real security threat for the Japanese.\u201cAbe may have exaggerated the level of support he got out of the bilateral meeting for domestic consumption,\u201d said Tadokoro.Trudeau may have been trying to steer clear of the issue \u201cin the fear of undermining its relations with Chinese,\u201d he added.Tadokoro said while there\u2019s no way to know what Abe and Trudeau actually said to each other, \u201cit is not uncommon in diplomacy that things are deliberately left for convenient interpretations of both sides.\u201dKenjiro Monji, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in recent interview that on security issues Canada has long kept its attention toward Europe and the south because it is an Atlantic state.Monji said Canada is also a Pacific nation, but Canadians\u2019 renewed focus on Asia has primarily been through \u201ceconomic lenses.\u201dHe added that Japan has put a lot of importance on TPP and hopes to ratify it as soon as possible.Trudeau repeated his government\u2019s long-held position Tuesday that the TPP was still subject to a thorough, cross-country review.The TPP was negotiated by the former Conservative government and the Liberals have yet to signal whether they will ratify it.But the future of the TPP is in doubt. U.S. presidential hopefuls from both major parties have said they would reject the deal if elected.On Tuesday, Trudeau focused on boosting Canada\u2019s economic ties to Japan. He personally invited Japanese auto executives to invest more in Canada.\t\t\t\n\t\tBut it appeared his efforts in Tokyo wouldn\u2019t immediately secure concrete commitments from the auto industry.Trudeau met with parts manufacturers and the presidents of three auto companies: Honda, Toyota and Subaru.The CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries, the firm that makes Subaru, told Trudeau he doesn\u2019t have any plans to expand capacity in the near term, though he might in the future, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary Cameron Ahmad said after the meeting.There were no announcements of imminent deals with the others, either.\u201cI am very much in the relationship-building mode,\u201d Trudeau told a news conference in Tokyo when asked whether the meetings would yield firm results.As part of his pitch, the prime minister also told Yoshinaga that Canadians are innovative and focused on quality.He later described the meetings as \u201csuccessful.\u201dEarlier Tuesday, Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, visited the Meiji Shrine, met with the emperor and empress of Japan and had dinner with Abe.Trudeau\u2019s Tokyo visit came ahead of the Group of Seven summit on Thursday and Friday in Japan\u2019s Ise-Shima region.', u'Drunk driving convictions keep engineer off the road but not off busy rail lineNEW YORK \u2013 An engineer is operating trains along the third-largest commuter railroad in the United States, even though his driver\u2019s license has been suspended for 10 years because of a history of driving while intoxicated.New Jersey Transit engineer Thomas Broschart\u2019s license was suspended in 2007 for a decade, and he has someone pick him up from work because he isn\u2019t legally allowed to drive a car, according to an investigation by . But federal law doesn\u2019t require him to have a motor vehicle driver\u2019s license to operate a train.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a driver\u2019s license,\u201d Broschart said. \u201cOne has nothing to do with the other.\u201dNJ Transit said it\u2019s following the law but would welcome stricter regulations.\u201cFederal law governing engineers sets forth specific regulations in dealing with DWI cases involving engineers and we are obligated to follow those Federal Railroad Administration rules,\u201d NJ Transit said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe code was strictly adhered to and the engineer is certified to operate locomotives according to federal law.\u201dWhen asked whether his supervisors know that his driver\u2019s license was revoked, Broschart responded, \u201cAbsolutely. Everybody knows.\u201dIn 1995, Broschart\u2019s license was suspended for two years because he refused to have his blood-alcohol level tested, the TV station reported. In 1999, his license was suspended for a year for driving while intoxicated, and in 2001, his license was suspended for not complying with a mandatory alcohol program.U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez said it was \u201cpretty alarming\u201d that Broschart can transport commuters but can\u2019t legally drive to and from work. The New Jersey Democrat has asked his staff to contact the Federal Railroad Administration to determine whether a law needs to be changed.NJ Transit said, \u201cAnything that could be done to strengthen those federal rules and protect our customers and employees would be welcome.\u201d', u'Dozens of real estate companies fail to comply with anti-money-laundering lawsTORONTO \u2013 At least 85 real estate companies have not implemented a plan showing how they are trying to detect money laundering and other suspicious transactions, nearly 15 years after they were required to do so, according to data obtained by The Canadian Press.The federal anti-money laundering agency received 337 compliance reports from roughly 1,000 companies in the real estate sector it surveyed \u2014 including brokers, sales representatives and developers \u2014 between Jan. 1, 2013, and Feb. 8, 2016.The data, which was obtained through an access-to-information request, represents only a small sampling of the real estate industry. There are about 20,000 companies in the real estate sector that are required to report to Fintrac.An analysis of the data contained in those reports found that roughly a quarter of the 337 respondents admitted they had not yet fully implemented a compliance regime, which has been required by federal anti-money laundering laws since 2001.Thirty-eight of the companies said they had only partially implemented a compliance regime, while the other 47 said they had not even begun to do so. The names of the companies were not included in the documents.Fintrac spokesman Darren Gibb says some of the reports weren\u2019t sent back because the companies no longer exist, while others simply failed to respond.Fintrac routinely sends out compliance reports to various sectors to gather information about the companies it regulates, says Gibb.Those reports can sometimes lead to further enforcement actions such as on-site examinations, he says.\u201cIf we see an assessment report come back and it\u2019s clear that the entity is not where they should be, then certainly that\u2019s a flag for us that it may be examination-worthy,\u201d says Gibb.\u201cOr conversely, if we don\u2019t get an assessment report coming back, that\u2019s potentially an even bigger flag.\u201dIf violations are discovered during an examination, that could lead to fines of up to $100,000 per violation for individuals and up to $500,000 per violation for companies, depending on severity.Gibb was unable to specify how many of the 85 companies that did not have a compliance plan were fined, noting that the reports are only one factor that the agency considers when deciding whether to investigate a particular firm.The largest number of firms that admitted they have yet to finish implementing a compliance regime was in Quebec, where there were 32 such companies.Gibb said he could not speculate as to why the figure was higher in Quebec than in other provinces.In Ontario, 19 firms said they hadn\u2019t fully implemented a compliance regime, while in Alberta there were 12 such cases. Eight of the B.C. real estate firms surveyed reported that they hadn\u2019t finished setting up a compliance regime.Meanwhile, 43 of the companies surveyed nationwide said they had not yet appointed a compliance officer, as required by law.Ottawa also requires companies subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to have a system in place for training their employees on how to comply with the law.The data obtained by The Canadian Press found that 42 of the 337 companies surveyed by Fintrac had only started implementing a training system, while 57 had not even begun yet.Pierre Leduc, a spokesman for the Canadian Real Estate Association, says keeping up with the changes to anti-money laundering laws is a challenge for the real estate sector because most realtors work on their own and are not big corporations like banks or casinos.\u201cIn addition, until recently, awareness was low, which is why CREA embarked on a national information tour to raise awareness and explain compliance responsibilities,\u201d Leduc said in an email.', u'WestJet move part of broader telecommuting pushMONTREAL \u2013 Like many Canadians, Carla Holub has gladly given up commuting for the ease and comfort of working from home.The 41-year-old WestJet sales agent says she has no regrets since she made the change three years ago. Telecommuting affords her the time to take her children to dance lessons and hockey while reducing her lunch, coffee, gas and car insurance costs, she says.\u201cIt\u2019s been a great switch,\u201d she said from Calgary. \u201cIt just freed up a good two hours of my personal time being able to work from my home office.\u201dWestJet Airlines plans to establish a bilingual call centre in Moncton, N.B., but most of the 400 agents will work from home. They will join about 85 per cent of the airline\u2019s 900 call centre workers in Calgary who since 2013 have shifted to fielding customer calls remotely.The move has saved WestJet the cost of expanding its office to accommodate its growing staff, though that is partially offset by expenses to buy extra computers for employees so that they can work from home.Spokesman Robert Palmer said the transition was mainly designed to respond to workers who desire a better work-life balance.\u201cFrom an employer\u2019s perspective, generally speaking it makes for a happier employee and a happier employee is generally more productive,\u201d he said.The shift to telecommuting has accelerated since the 1990s growth of technology, said Sheryl Boswell, director of marketing for job website Monster Canada.She said most companies that allow employees to work from home are looking to build their businesses without added office expenses. They are also seeking access to a broader talent pool, she said.\u201cI think more employers are doing it because this is what seekers today demand,\u201d said Boswell, who herself telecommutes two days a week.More than 1.7 million paid employees \u2014 those not self-employed \u2014 worked from home in 2008 at least once a week, up almost 23 per cent from the 1.4 million in 2000, according to the latest Statistics Canada report on the subject in 2010.Despite the increase, the proportion of paid employees working from home grew by just one percentage point to 11.2 per cent during the period. A faster pace of growth among self-employed pushed the total proportion of people working from home up two percentage points to 19 per cent in 2008.Louise Howard is typical of those many self-employed home workers. The mother of children aged six and eight spends a few hours a day sewing clothing and accessories for children from her dining room that she sells online and to neighbourhood stores.\u201cIt\u2019s more a hobby that\u2019s become a business by accident,\u201d said the Montrealer, who says she makes about minimum wage for an average of three hours per day.Monster Canada says nearly 5,000 home-based employment positions are currently listed on its website, up 18 per cent from last year. Available positions vary from customer service and sales representatives to tech support, finance and real estate services. The growth of social media has also pushed companies to hire writers to create content.Telecommuting can also appeal to older workers, allowing businesses to adapt to changing demographics.\u201cIt\u2019s a weapon in a company\u2019s arsenal to attract great employees,\u201d said Robert Campbell, president of trade association ContactNB.About 30 per cent of New Brunswick\u2019s more than 100 call centres allow some form of telecommuting, Campbell said, adding that the workers have a range of jobs that include medical telecare, grief counselling, funeral planning and financial advice.', u'Justin Trudeau heads to Japan to talk trade, investmentsJustin Trudeau makes his first major push into Asia this week in Japan, where he hopes to broaden business links with a country that was once Canada\u2019s No. 2 trading partner.The prime minister will depart Sunday for his first overseas bilateral visit since taking office last fall.He will meet early in the week in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the emperor and empress as well as leaders in the automotive sector.The visit comes ahead of Trudeau\u2019s participation in the Group of Seven summit, on Thursday and Friday, in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.But before Trudeau sits down with the powerful group of world leaders, he will try to reinvigorate Canada\u2019s trade and investment relationship with Japan.His office says it believes there is still a lot of fertile ground in Japan and sees it as a key player in a region where the Liberal government intends to expand economic ties.One of the main goals of Trudeau\u2019s visit will be to try to encourage Japanese auto industry officials to invest more and to keep the plants already in Canada.In his meeting with Abe, Trudeau\u2019s office said he plans to discuss negotiations on the countries\u2019 economic partnership agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, security co-operation, education and the Arctic, given Japan\u2019s relative proximity.The Japanese-Canadian relationship has been a smooth one, but there are still several ways it could be improved.For starters, Japan\u2019s ambassador in Ottawa notes that fewer than 15 years ago, his country was Canada\u2019s No. 2 trading partner after the United States.But Kenjiro Monji says Japan\u2019s trade position with Canada has slipped since 2002.In 2009, he said Japan had tumbled to No. 5 after being passed by China, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The value of trade between Japan and British Columbia fell by 45 per cent between 2000 and 2014, Monji added.The slide, he said, is due to nearly two decades of recession in Japan, China\u2019s economic boom and the emergence of Canadian trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.Monji believes the bilateral trade could get a boost from a key Canadian energy source that Japan needs: liquefied natural gas.Japan, the world\u2019s biggest buyer of LNG, is hoping Canada will issue necessary environmental permits to allow companies to export it from British Columbia.B.C. Premier Christy Clark recently told The Canadian Press it\u2019s time to proceed given the approval process started more than three years ago.\u201cCanada is one of the most-promising potential exporters to Japan because \u2026 liquefied natural gas occupies a still very important share in our energy policy,\u201d said Monji, who noted that Japanese companies are involved in several LNG projects in Canada.Japan is also expected to tout the benefits for Canada of the , a huge, 12-country treaty that would deepen trade connections across the Asia-Pacific region.The pact, which Canada is reviewing, includes the major economies of Japan and the United States.The controversial, yet-to-be-ratified TPP, negotiated by the former Conservative government, has raised concerns in several Canadian industries.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe future of the TPP is in doubt. U.S. presidential hopefuls from both the Democrats and Republicans have said they would reject the treaty.With the TPP still pending, Monji doesn\u2019t expect any movement on talks of a bilateral Canada-Japan trade deal.He did praise the Canda-Japan relationship and was quick to point out this will be Trudeau and Abe\u2019s third meeting in six months. They sat down together at the APEC summit in Manila and again in Washington for a nuclear safety talks.Japan is also expected to raise the issue of regional security with Canada, particularly the ongoing territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea.Masayuki Tadokoro, a Keio University law professor, said Japan will scrutinize Trudeau\u2019s words on the matter, even though Canada may not want to take very strong position due its economic interests in China.\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s very difficult for many Canadians and Europeans to understand, but for Japanese, China represents a real security threat.\u201dOverall, there are few entanglements between Canada and Japan, but they do have a trade relationship many believe has unrealized potential, says David Welch, CIGI chair of global security at the Balsillie School of International Affairs.Welch said it\u2019s partly due to the complexities of selling in Japan and the fact Canada has put more focus in recent years on trade with Latin America and Europe.\u201cNow, the Japanese have huge hopes that Trudeau will bring Canada back. I hear this all the time, not just from Japan, but from other countries in the region, too.\u201d\xa0', u'How knowing how much homes sell for could make it easier for you to buy a home in CanadaBuying a home may soon be a bit less stressful for Canadians\xa0thanks to a\xa0precedent-setting ruling that could force real estate boards to hand over data on home sales and in turn make buying a home more transparent.In April, \xa0in a long-standing dispute over access to home sales data. The tribunal ruled the TREB\xa0was creating unfair competition and keeping prices high by keeping data \u2013 like how much money a\xa0home sold for \u2013 private.By only providing that data to personal clients, the tribunal ruled  \u201cnew and innovative real estate brokerage services using the Internet.\u201dTREB maintains that it limits access to this data to ensure the privacy of its buyers and sellers.While it\u2019s not yet clear what type of data will be released, many brokerages believe the ruling could set a precedent for other real estate boards in Canada to release their home sales data.And that has the potential to make the entire home buying experience a lot less stressful for Canadians.Currently, Canadian real estate sales data isn\u2019t very \u201cGoogle-able.\u201d \xa0From trip planning, to finding a new restaurant for dinner, nearly everyone takes to the Internet, or an app, to research before committing to an idea (especially when money is involved).Sure, it\u2019s easy enough to look up list prices for houses in your preferred neighbourhood \u2013 but what you really want to know is the final selling price of those houses.This is especially important in  \u2013 Toronto and Vancouver \u2013 , where homes are purposely under-priced to drive up prices. A recent report by the CBC showed that the Rokham Fard, , said if selling prices were more accessible, consumers would have more insight into what they can actually afford.\u201cYou could inform the buyer that based on prior data the seller has listed the home at a lower price point, based on what other homes in the area have sold for,\u201d Fard told Global News.\u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t get mentally drained from going into all of these bidding wars.\u201dRecognizing the potential power of this data, Toronto\u2019s Spring Reality is working on a database that will predict what homes might sell for using past sales data.\u201cWhat we want to do is stop wasting people\u2019s time,\u201d said Mamourian. \u201cWe want to narrow down on the number of people with a $700,000 budget looking at properties that sell for over $800,000.\u201dBut Mamourian\u2019s team can\u2019t move forward with their project until the tribunal provides more information about what data TREB should release.Meanwhile other real estate startups are turning to crowdsourcing.Take for example RedDoor \u2013  by crowdsourcing selling data from home buyers themselves.RedDoor allows users to compare estimated property values by neighbourhood, right down to a specific street. Homeowners are encouraged to share details about their property, along with the selling price, in order to build the database. In exchange for their data, RedDoor donates to a charity that operates in their neighbourhood.The app, which launched earlier this month, already has data on over 100,000 Toronto-area homes in 44 neighbourhoods.\u201cI think people feel that because there is no way to vet real estate information, you end up putting so much trust into another person [a real estate agent] to tell you what your home is worth or what you can afford,\u201d said RedDoor cofounder Adrienne Scott.\u201cWe live in a world where we can research so much on our own \u2013 if that information is locked away by key it only makes things more difficult.\u201dScott believes that the outcome of the TREB ruling will ultimately trickle down to other major cities in the country and allow companies like hers to grow their databases outside of Toronto.Global News reached out to many real estate boards across the country,including the Realators\xa0Association of Edmonton\xa0and\xa0the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver; however, all declined to comment until more information about the ruling becomes\xa0available.In a statement to Global News, the Canadian Real Estate Association said: \u201cWhile the Tribunal partially granted the Commissioner\u2019s application against TREB, it has asked the parties to make further submissions regarding the appropriate remedy. We will not be in a position to fully assess the ramifications of the decision until the Tribunal decides the issue of remedy and issues its Order.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire to have modest economic effect: fedsOTTAWA \u2013 Finance Minister Bill Morneau says he expects the Alberta wildfires to have a relatively modest impact on the broader economy.Morneau also says the economic fallout from the disaster will be largely contained to the current quarter of the fiscal year.A huge wildfire forced the evacuation of Fort McMurray as well as the shutdown of some economically important oilsands operations.The blaze also destroyed 2,400 buildings in Fort McMurray.Morneau says investments over the coming months in response to the wildfire will not only help the people of Fort McMurray \u2014 they will also help the economy bounce back.He says the government\u2019s initial focus was the human challenge, such as the matching of charitable donations.Morneau made the comments during a conference call to reporters. He is in Japan for a meeting of G7 finance ministers.', u'Connacher Oil and Gas gets OK from court to put oilsands leases, plants up for saleConnacher Oil and Gas Ltd. and its court-appointed monitor are seeking offers for its oilsands leases and extraction plants.The Calgary-based company says prospective buyers have until June 30 to submit initial non-binding letters of intent.Connacher\u2019s assets include two extraction facilities that produced about 14,500 barrels per day in 2015. Currently, their output has been reduced to 8,000 barrels per day due to low commodity prices.The company also has 87,000 net acres (35,200 hectares) of oilsands leases southwest of , Alta. At 2015 production rates, they represent 40 years of reserves.Connacher is operating under court protection from creditors as it deals with depressed prices for oil, its limited ability to raise capital and disruptions caused by the wildfires that caused the Fort McMurray evacuation.The company announced late Thursday that the sales process has been approved by Alberta\u2019s Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.', u'Canada\u2019s inflation rate rises to 1.7 per cent in AprilOTTAWA \u2013 The annual pace of inflation in Canada picked up in April as the impact of lower energy prices moderated and the cost of food and shelter continued to rise.Statistics Canada said Friday that the consumer price index climbed 1.7 per cent in April compared with a year ago and was up from a 1.3 per cent increase in March.The Bank of Canada\u2019s core inflation, which excludes some of the most volatile items, also increased. up 2.2 per cent compared with a year ago and higher than the 2.1 per cent pace set in March.Bank of Montreal senior economist Robert Kavcic said the rise in prices counterbalances some of the weaker data that has come out for March ahead of the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate announcement next week.\u201cThe (central) bank is going to be looking at some softer data on the one hand, but pretty sticky core inflation on the other hand,\u201d Kavcic said.\u201cWhen they meet next week, they are probably going to add all of that up and see them pretty firmly on the sidelines, still not moving on interest rates.\u201dIn addition to inflation, Statistics Canada also reported Friday that retail sales fell 1.0 per cent to $43.8 billion in March after posting gains in January and February. Economists had expected a drop of 0.6 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.The weaker than expected retail sales figures followed lower manufacturing and wholesale sales results for March that were released earlier in the week.The Bank of Montreal said it now expects the economy to contract in the second quarter due to the weak hand-off from the first three months of the year and the oilsands production shutdowns in Alberta due to forest fires.\u201cGoing into the second quarter things are going to get quite a bit tougher,\u201d said Kavcic, who expects to the economy to swing back to growth in the third quarter.CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld said the inflation was firmer than expected, but noted that it included some one-time impacts like the drop in the loonie last year.\u201cCanada\u2019s economy in the first quarter came in like a lion but went out like a lamb, as retail sales joined other indicators in pointing to a much more subdued picture in March,\u201d Shenfeld wrote in a note to clients.\u201cOverall, today\u2019s data is a saw-off for markets, with retail\u2019s sag countered by a bit firmer CPI.\u201dThe inflation report noted that energy prices in April were down 3.2 per cent compared with a year ago, but the drop was much smaller than the 7.8 per cent decline in March.Gasoline in April was down 5.8 per cent compared with a year ago, while natural gas fell 12.8 per cent and fuel oil plunged 19.3 per cent. The moves compared with drops of 13.6 per cent, 17.4 per cent and 25.8 per cent respectively for March.Meanwhile, fresh vegetables were up 11.7 per cent year-over-year in April, food from restaurants was up 2.7 per cent and passenger vehicles gained 4.6 per cent. Electricity costs were up 6.5 per cent.Prices were up in seven of the eight major components compared with a year ago.The clothing and footwear group was the only one of eight major index components to see a drop. It moved down 0.2 per cent. Women\u2019s clothing slipped 0.5 per cent, while men\u2019s clothing was unchanged.Prices were up in nine of 10 provinces compared with a year ago. Alberta held steady.', u'Loonie slides to lowest level in weeks amid falling oil pricesTORONTO \u2013 The Canadian dollar closed at its lowest level in more than a month Thursday as it faced continued pressure from a strengthening U.S. currency and falling oil prices.The loonie fell for a third straight session, giving back 0.48 of a U.S. cent to 76.31 cents US. The last time it finished below that was on April 7 when it closed at 76.08 cents US.Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Canada, said the U.S. greenback strengthened amid signs that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates as early as June.\u201cThere\u2019s been a big rally in the U.S. dollar obviously since the Fed minutes came out Wednesday so that is depressing all currencies,\u201d he said. \u201cCanada, more than some others, because it took down the oil price as well.\u201dCieszynski added that there could also be sizable moves in the Canadian dollar on Friday when Statistics Canada releases reports on consumer prices and retail sales.In commodities, the July contract for North American benchmark crude lost 11 cents to US$48.67 a barrel, while June natural gas rallied four cents to US$2.04 per mmBtu.The June contract for gold bullion was down $19.60 at US$1,254.80 a troy ounce, settling at its lowest price since April 27. July copper shed two cents to US$2.06 a pound.The negative sentiment on commodities had little effect on the Toronto stock market, which ended the day little changed, finding support from materials, gold and consumer staples stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index dipped 8.69 points to 13,817.32.In New York, traders continued to digest hints from the Fed on a rate hike coming earlier than previously expected.On Wednesday, the central bank released minutes that showed its policy-makers believe it \u201clikely would be appropriate\u201d to raise rates at its next meeting on June 14-15 should growth in the economy and employment remain on track.Low interest rates have been credited with buoying stock markets since the Great Recession. The Fed boosted its key policy for the first time in nearly a decade in December but has since held back as financial market turmoil in January slowed U.S. growth.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 91.22 points to 17,435.40, while the broader S&P 500 fell 7.59 points to 2,040.04.

The SEC says Mickelson made the trade the next day and reaped a profit of $931,000 that he used to help pay off the debt.Ceresney declined to spell out the rationale for not making Mickelson part of the criminal case, other than, \u201cWe bring charges based on the evidence and the law.\u201dThe case comes in the wake of a 2014 appeals court decision that made prosecuting people benefiting from inside tips more difficult. The ruling found that in order to be charged, there must be evidence a defendant had first-hand knowledge about the origins of the inside information.\u201cBasically everybody has to know everybody else\u2019s role in the scheme,\u201d said Anthony Sabino, an attorney specializing in white-collar legal issues and a business professor at St. John\u2019s University in New York.That may have been too high a hurdle for the prosecutors to surmount with Mickelson. He was allegedly tipped by Walters, but didn\u2019t necessarily know Walters\u2019 source of the information.Mickelson\u2019s management group issued a statement Thursday saying that he felt \u201cvindicated\u201d because prosecutors hadn\u2019t charged him with breaking securities laws. It added: \u201cHe takes full responsibility for the decisions and associations that led him to becoming part of this investigation.\u201dDavis, 67, who resigned from Dean Foods\u2019 board of directors last year, has already pleaded guilty in the case and is co-operating with the investigation, Bharara said at the news conference. Walters, 69, was arrested by the FBI in Las Vegas on Wednesday. He was scheduled for arraignment Thursday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas.In a statement, defence attorney Barry Burke called Walters \u2014 a multimillionaire who owns several golf courses and auto dealerships \u2014 \u201can American success story.\u201d The accusations, he added, \u201care based on erroneous assumptions, speculative theories and false finger-pointing.\u201dDavis\u2019 attorney, Christopher Clark, confirmed his client was co-operating, but declined further comment.From 2008 through 2012, the SEC said, Davis passed Walters highly confidential information on Dean Foods, including sneak previews of at least six of the company\u2019s quarterly earnings announcements and advance notice of the spin-off of its profitable subsidiary, WhiteWave Foods Co.In 2013, Davis also gave Walters inside information he\u2019d gotten from a group of investors who confidentially shared their plans to buy stock in Darden Restaurants Inc., the SEC said. Based on the tips, Walters reaped illegal trading profits and avoided losses of at least $40 million, according to the regulators.Prosecutors allege Walters gave Davis a prepaid cellular phone to use when passing tips, with instructions to use code words, like \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d to refer to Dean Foods, prosecutors said.The complaint alleges that Mickelson had placed bets with Walters before the stock tip, and that the golfer owed Walters money at the time of the trading. It says that two months later, Mickelson repaid Walters \u201cin part with the proceeds of his trading.\u201dIt did not say how much Mickelson owed.The complaint has the attention of the PGA Tour, which has a section in its player handbook related to gambling. One part of the regulation says that player shall not \u201cassociate with or have dealings with persons whose activities, including gambling, might reflect adversely upon the integrity of the game of golf.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re in the process of looking at and determining,\u201d tour spokesman Ty Votaw said Wednesday evening.The PGA Tour, unlike other sports, does not disclose any disciplinary matter. Asked if Mickelson could be in violation, Votaw said only that \u201cyou quoted the regulation accurately.\u201d It had no further comment.In May 2014, Mickelson confirmed that FBI agents investigating insider trading questioned him as he finished playing a round at the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio, and said he was co-operating with the investigation.\t\t\t\n\t\tMickelson, 45, was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2011. He has won 42 tour events, including five majors \u2014 three Masters, one PGA Championship and one British Open. Forbes put his earnings last year at $51 million.He has long had a reputation for being a gambler, though he has said he scaled back his habit after his son, Evan, was born in 2003. The most publicized payoff was when Mickelson and friends won $560,000 on a preseason bet (28-1 odds) that the Baltimore Ravens would win the 2001 Super Bowl.He also has a history of playing money games during the practice rounds. He occasionally gets a group of players and caddies together for dinner and small wagering during the NBA and NHL playoffs, and prominent fights.In their statement, Mickelson\u2019s management representatives said he wasn\u2019t losing any endorsement deals over the inside trading episode.\u201cPhil understands and deeply respects the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and of Phil himself,\u201d they said. \u201cHe subscribes to the same values and regrets any appearance that, on this occasion, he fell short. \u201d___', u'Alberta\u2019s credit rating downgraded againEDMONTON \u2013 Alberta\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded again.Standard & Poor\u2019s has changed the province\u2019s rating from double-A-plus to double-A.The company says the downgrade reflects what it calls \u201cAlberta\u2019s very weak budgetary performance and high, increasing debt burden.\u201dIt also cites uncertainty about the province\u2019s willingness to take measures to improve its budget shortfalls within the next two years.Last month,  and  due to concerns about the province\u2019s debt after the NDP government introduced its budget.Alberta\u2019s budget includes a $10.4-billion deficit this year.\u201cThe one-notch downgrade reflects the impact of depressed oil prices on Alberta\u2019s important resource revenues, and the province\u2019s fiscal response that, so far, has not meaningfully counterbalanced this external shock,\u201d Standard & Poor\u2019s said in a report released Thursday.\u201cBased on the province\u2019s latest budget released last month, we now expect the depth and duration of the province\u2019s after-capital deficits and related run-up in tax-support debt to be much greater than what we foresaw in our last review in December 2015, leading us to conclude that Alberta\u2019s credit profile is no longer consistent with the \u2018AA+\u2019 rating.\u201dIn December, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded Alberta\u2019s rating to double-A-plus from triple-A.', u'Mining projects getting close look in foreign aid review: international development ministerOTTAWA \u2013 The international development minister says she wants to see what more can be done to help indigenous people who are affected by Canadian mining operations abroad.Marie-Claude Bibeau says that is one potential change in Canada\u2019s foreign aid policy as she embarks on a sweeping review of the country\u2019s international development assistance.Bibeau announced the terms of wide-ranging public consultations on revamping aid policy this week, as the Trudeau government faced international pressure to boost overall aid spending to meet a UN target.Bibeau stressed the need to help women and girls \u2014 a \u201cfeminist approach,\u201d she called it \u2014 as well as recognizing the need to help failing and fragile states and deal with the impact of climate change.She also plans to take a closer look at so called public-private partnerships that have seen aid dollars spent in conjunction with resource companies.The previous Conservative government pushed these partnerships over the protests of many non-governmental organizations, while some Canadian companies have periodically faced accusations of riding roughshod over the rights of local indigenous people in developing countries.Natural resource exploitation is important for the economic growth of many developing countries, Bibeau explained in an interview Thursday.But she said she plans to review the preliminary reports on the five pilot projects involving Canadian resource companies in aid partnerships.The Conservatives were also accused of linking Canada\u2019s trade ambitions too closely with its aid policy.Bibeau said helping the poorest of the poor \u2014 her mandate \u2014 is separate from that of her colleague, International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland, which is to foster Canadian business and investment opportunities abroad. But Bibeau said those two interests are not mutually exclusive.\u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done for vulnerable people, so I really look forward to working in partnership with minister Freeland because we have different objectives but we share the same concerns in terms of human rights.\u201dThe review will examine the 25 countries of focus where the majority of Canada\u2019s development spending is targeted.The decision to include countries such as Peru and Colombia, both of which have free trade deals with Canada, or Mongolia, where Canadian mining companies are heavily invested, has also been questioned by critics.Without giving specifics, Bibeau said she expects some of those countries to change but added it\u2019s too early to tell which.Santiago Alba-Corral, the senior director of international development for CARE Canada, told a House of Commons committee earlier this week that the time had come for Canada to re-evaluate its countries of focus.While the amalgamation of the now defunct Canadian International Development Agency with foreign affairs and trade under the new Global Affairs Canada banner might pay dividends, Alba-Corral warned of one possible risk.\u201cInternational development itself is undermined if it\u2019s seen to support trade and diplomatic outcomes,\u201d he told the Commons foreign affairs and development committee.The government launched an on-line consultation this week that extends to the end of July.Bibeau said she\u2019s reaching out to civil society groups, and will leverage Canadian missions in developing countries to get on-the-ground input from local people.She plans to deliver a five-year plan to cabinet later this year and she\u2019s also consulting with Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, who has also embarked on his own defence policy review.', u'Tax credit to offer incentive to NS farmers donating produce to food banksRustic wooden crates filled with apples and onions and baskets overflowing with fresh produce graced the Feed Nova Scotia warehouse in Bedford, Nova Scotia Thursday.They were donated by various local farmers upon the announcement of the impending approval of the new provincial The credit, which has been in the works for a few years, is aimed at providing greater tax relief to farmers who donate surplus produce to food banks.Food banks will be able to issue a tax receipt to farmers that is equal to 25 per cent of the value of the donation received. Donations will also remain eligible for the Charitable Donation Tax Credit.Chris van den Heuvel, president of the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture, says the tax credit will not only benefit farmers, but it will also help the food banks meet an .On average, nearly 44,000 Nova Scotians visit a food bank at least once during the year.Agriculture Minister Keith Colwell commended the new tax credit for its support of farmers who have continually made large contributions to food banks through the years.\u201cThis is fantastic news for Nova Scotia, it\u2019s fantastic news for the farmers of the province that have donated so much food to the food bank for such a long time. But most importantly, it\u2019s important to the people in the community that need to come to the food bank,\u201d he said.According to van den Heuvel, in the past year Nova Scotia\u2019s farmers donated over 149,000 kilograms of produce to food banks.Nick Jennery, the executive director of Feed Nova Scotia, sees this tax credit as a means to help people give back to their community.Once the credit is approved, it can be applied to any donations made by farmers from January 1, 2016 onward.Colwell says the details of the tax credit are in the process of being approved, and once finalized the credit would be implemented in a few days.', u'Conrad Black fighting liens on his mansion, CRA says he owes $15MTORONTO \u2013 Conrad Black is fighting two liens that have been placed on his Toronto mansion that claim he owes more than $15 million in unpaid taxes.The former media mogul filed a notice of application Wednesday with the Federal Court for a judicial review of the liens.The liens were filed against Black\u2019s home on May 6 and May 10, alleging that he owes taxes from 2002, 2003 and 2008.The Canada Revenue Agency claims that Black is in arrears in the amounts of $12,307,717 and $3,513,877.In his notice of application, Black claims the national revenue minister used information that contained \u201cmaterial omissions and inaccuracies\u201d and wasn\u2019t \u201cfull and frank\u201d when applying to the court for the liens.The document also says there are reasonable grounds to doubt CRA claims that payment would be jeopardized if the collection of the taxes were delayed.According to the Multiple Listings Service, which tracks real estate sales, Black sold his 23,000-square foot property in the tony Bridle Path neighbourhood to an undisclosed buyer for $16.5 million in March. Black has three mortgages on the house for $15.5 million.He and his wife, Barbara Amiel-Black, plan on continuing to live in the nine-bedroom, 11-bathroom home, as part of a lease-back deal.At one time, Black controlled Toronto-based Hollinger International, once one of the world\u2019s largest English-language newspaper empires whose flagship publications included the Daily Telegraph, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post and the National Post.The estate at 26 Park Lane Circle was originally built by Black\u2019s father, George Montegu Black, and had been in the family for 65 years.', u'Decades-long dispute over value of Citadel Hill nearing resolution: HalifaxMunicipal officials in Halifax say a 22-year-long dispute with the federal government over the value of Citadel Hill is nearing an end.Halifax spokesman Brendan Elliott says acting CAO John Traves has been in discussions with Ottawa recently and feels a resolution will be reached \u201cshortly.\u201dThe  to help determine how much Ottawa owes the city in back taxes for the national historic site.Early last year, the payment in lieu of taxes advisory panel valued Citadel Hill at $41.2 million \u2013 $37.6 million more than what Ottawa argued the national historic site was worth.The panel\u2019s recommendation was sent to the Public Works Department and minister Judy Foote will ultimately make the final decision, more than two decades after the dispute began.The federal government had argued in Canada\u2019s top court that the roughly 16 hectares of land in downtown Halifax was only worth $10 because it has no commercial value.But the Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that Ottawa cannot set payments based on its own property value assessments that are far lower than provincial assessments.While the federal government does not pay property taxes, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act provides a framework for municipalities to collect on federal property such as national historic sites and parks.', u'Timeline: Key dates in history of the Trans Mountain pipelineKinder Morgan\u2019s proposal to triple the capacity of its 63-year-old  to 900,000 barrels per day has faced a rough ride from environmentalists, aboriginal groups and municipalities. It is not the first expansion of the pipeline, but it has faced the most scrutiny.Here are some key dates in the history of the Trans Mountain pipeline as it awaits a  from the National Energy Board: The Trans Mountain pipeline begins shipping oil with an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day. The project features four pump stations along its 1,150-kilometre route and a marine dock that connects loading facilities on the east side of Edmonton with ocean tankers in Burnaby, B.C. Pipeline capacity is expanded via the construction of a 160-kilometre pipeline loop. The Westridge Marine Terminal is built and commissioned in Burnaby, B.C. Trans Mountain\u2019s biggest spill occurs at a tank farm in the Edmonton area. Nearly 10,000 barrels of oil are released. The Anchor Loop project adds 160 kilometres of new pipeline through Jasper National Park and Mount Robson Provincial Park between Hinton, Alta., and Hargreaves, B.C. The extension includes 13 new pump stations and modifications to existing stations, increasing capacity from 260,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd. Kinder Morgan says it wants to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline after receiving support from oil shippers and will begin public consultations. An application is made to the NEB to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, with construction proposed to begin in 2017 and service by December 2019. More than 100 people are arrested after they camp out in a conservation area on Burnaby Mountain, east of Vancouver, to block crews from conducting drilling and survey work related to the pipeline expansion. Most of the charges are later dropped. Weeks before the election campaign, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau promises increased consultation on pipeline projects as part of his party\u2019s environmental platform. The NEB postpones public hearings after striking from the record economic evidence prepared by a Kinder Morgan consultant who was to begin working for the regulator. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley says in a written submission to the NEB that the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is in the best interests of both Alberta and Canada. The federal Liberal government says pipeline projects such as the Trans Mountain expansion will now be assessed in part on the greenhouse gas emissions produced in the extraction and processing of the oil they carry. Proponents will also be required to improve consultations with aboriginals. Ottawa appoints a three-member panel to conduct an environmental review of the Trans Mountain expansion project and report in November.', u'It\u2019s not just a paycheque: Finding happiness through employmentWork-life balance is more than just a buzzy term: a new Ipsos poll finds a significant percentage of people think a new career can lead to improved\xa0overall\xa0well-being.\u201cA strong 45 per cent said getting a new job or career would help their personal well-being,\u201d said Jennifer\xa0McLeod Macey, a vice president\xa0of public affairs with\xa0Ipsos\u2019 and a lead of its Health Research Institute.Unemployment and jobs have overtaken healthcare at the top of\xa0priority lists for Canadians, McLeod Macey added, a shift that\u2019s largely\xa0sparked by Canada\u2019s oilsands taking a hit and the ensuing economic challenges.This holds true in Alberta as well as in Ontario, where half of the province\u2019s residents agreed they would be happier with a job change.\u201cPersonal well-being is so much more than physical health and mental health, this goes to show that.\u201d \t\t\t\n\t\tThe numbers of those who think that shifting jobs will improve well-being were particularly high among those in lower income brackets and Millennials.\u201cIt\u2019s significantly higher among those at the\xa0lower income [level]\u2026 unhappy with finances overall, thinking that better job would help with that, a better paying job,\u201d said McLeod Macey.People in higher income brackets were more likely to respond that a better sex life or weight loss would improve their overall well-being.From being in a rut, to personal growth or to making more money, there are many motivators to wanting or needing a new job.\u201cPeople experience their challenges and barriers in different ways; tied back to their strengths and their life situations and expertise, gifts they have or are missing,\u201d said Robin Swets, certified life coach with  in Victoria, B.C.Some people lack challenge in their role; others simply\xa0never settled in one position for long \u2013\xa0Swets calls them \u201cenvelope pushers.\u201d\u201cIt depends on what drives people. Some people are more happy at the front end of a situation where they are innovating, creating something. Other people are happier maintaining an existing system, drilling down into the details. So it depends on the person\u2019s learning style and work style. And ultimately their personality.\u201dSwet says people need to not be frozen by fear of change, and work to drive themselves to see it as an opportunity.\u201cPeople will always be unsettled in change\u2026 felt by some people more than others.\u201dHe recommends having an accountability partner to help maintain a feeling of control while taking the leap.Passion and fulfillment are just as important as compensation supporting the lifestyle people desire.\u201cAt the end of the day, are you feeling fulfilled, are you feeling connected? Is there meaning in your everyday work? I think those kinds of things are basic human needs in relation to their careers and typically people feel engaged and passionate about their work when those factors are met.\u201dWorkplaces need to understand the whole of their employees,\xa0McLeod Macey added.\u201cPeople are juggling quite a bit. Life is not as easy as it used to be \u2013\xa0more difficult than ever before.\u201cI hope people understand the complexity of what goes into happiness and well-being. There is more to it. And Canadians recognize that.\u201d', u'\u2018We don\u2019t deal well with not knowing\u2019: How to cope with economic uncertaintyAndrew\xa0Nicol\u2019s been better, life-wise.The 29-year-old Calgarian was one of 400 people who lost their jobs at Nexen Energy last March.He\u2019d worked at Nexen for a year as a geophysicist, mapping out resources underground. When oil prices took a dive, so did profit margins. New exploration was reduced, and Nicol was soon part of the shrinking industry\u2019s carnage.The job search is tough: Over the past two years, he\u2019s seen about 10 Canadian postings related to his field. Each gets 500 to 1,000 applications, he said.But like many of his now-former co-workers, he\u2019s decided to diversify.Nicol has put in about 500 hours since January into studying for his first chartered financial analyst exam in June. He doesn\u2019t have any financial experience but finds it interesting. Plus he figures it\u2019ll be good knowledge to have if ever he\u2019s able to get back into geophysics since he\u2019ll know how to invest his money.While he re-tools he\u2019s working part-time at \xa0the Heart and Stroke Foundation. It\u2019s a \u201cconsiderable\u201d pay cut, but it helps pay the rent.He also volunteers at the Geophysicists Organization as a way to network and stay on top of what\u2019s happening in the industry.Keeping busy with other extra-curriculars like sports has helped, he said, as has the support of his girlfriend, family and friends.\u201cI\u2019ve also stopped talking to a lot of people who have a negative outlook,\u201d Nicol added, explaining that he didn\u2019t want their negativity to bring him down.Grim economic outlook notwithstanding, Nicol would rather focus on the positive.\u201cThese things that they kind of used to do in their spare time but now that they\u2019re not working, they\u2019re trying to make some money off it.\u201dHe has this advice for others in his position: \u201cKeep your head up.\u201dThere are plenty of people struggling to take that to heart: Only half of the Canadians are satisfied with their lives, according to an exclusive  poll released to Global News Thursday.Many blame the economy. There are more people\xa0on EI in Alberta now than any time since 1997, including the height of the recession.The vast majority of Albertans and East Coast Canadians (86 and 88 per cent, respectively) rank a stronger economy third in terms of what they think would improve their personal well-being \u2014 right after getting more sleep and eating better.An economic uplift ranks fourth on the national wishlist, with 78 per cent citing it as something that could make them feel better about life. It edges out \u201cdoing more exercise and sports,\u201d mentioned by 79 per cent.Other new Ipsos research shows unemployment is the number one issue for Canadians right now.\u201cFor years what we saw there was health care,\u201d said Jennifer McLeod Macey, who leads the Health Research Institute for Ipsos. \u201cNow it\u2019s jobs.\u201dThe economic uncertainty has made for a lot of anxious clients\xa0at the .The centre bills clients on a sliding scale, based on their ability to pay.

When they\u2019re not, things seem scary.One way to cope is to \u201cjust focus on now\u201d and what you can control.That can mean simply\xa0getting out of bed and putting out resumes,\xa0not spending what little money you have left on frivolous things, and\xa0not turning to drugs and alcohol (that\u2019s one of the worst things you can do).As good as it is to talk about your concerns with people close to you, ruminating can make things worse.As for those faced with the prospect of settling for\xa0something that may not be their dream job, remember it\u2019s just temporary.\u201cEven if that means mowing lawns, or doing whatever you can get employment in\u2026\xa0Now is not forever.\u201d\u201cIn difficult circumstances, you do whatever you need to do.\u201d', u'Alberta judge quashes 2014 decision that ruled against Suncor random drug testsEDMONTON \u2013 Oilsands giant has won the latest round in its push to randomly test thousands of workers for drugs and alcohol in northern Alberta.A Court of Queen\u2019s Bench judge has quashed a 2014 arbitration panel ruling that determined the proposed testing plan would violate the privacy of union workers.The judge says the panel should have considered evidence about alcohol and drug incidents involving all workers at Suncor, including non-union contract employees.Justice Blair Nixon says a new arbitration panel should review the company\u2019s random testing plan, which Suncor first announced in 2012.Suncor Energy (TSX:SU) spokeswoman Sneh Seetal says the company is pleased with the ruling and that such testing aims to protect the safety of the public and workers.Unifor local 707-A says it will appeal the judge\u2019s decision and maintains that random testing violates the basic rights of union members.', u'Fracking firm Sanjel\u2019s Calgary headquarters to close amid \u2018miserable\u2019 demandThe head of the firm buying Sanjel Corp., Canada\u2019s largest privately held well-fracking company, says the target company\u2019s headquarters in Calgary will be shuttered when the deal closes later this month as a result of \u201cmiserable\u201d demand for its oilfield services.Regan Davis, president and CEO of Step Energy Services, also said that reports by two Sanjel employees that all but a handful of staff are losing their jobs are \u201ccomically inaccurate,\u201d but refused to give actual workforce numbers or say how many Sanjel staff will be offered Step jobs.\u201cWe\u2019ve been hiring some. We\u2019re hopeful we will be able hire some more. But at this point we just don\u2019t have a whole bunch of clarity on that,\u201d Davis said in an interview earlier this week.The office workers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had been told their jobs would end May 31, adding that most of their co-workers had also been told they would no longer be needed.Sanjel said in court documents last month that it had trimmed its workforce in Canada and the United States from 4,300 to 2,200 since the end of 2014 as low oil prices and shrinking client spending plans cut deeply into revenue. It\u2019s unclear how many of those staff worked in Canada.\u201cIt\u2019s probably worth reiterating that this was an asset transaction to begin with,\u201d said Davis. \u201cSo it was never a transaction where we were buying the company; we were buying the assets of the company.\u201dDavis said there are no plans to increase the size of Step\u2019s Calgary offices after the Sanjel deal closes.However, Sanjel\u2019s oilfield cementing operations are being spun off into a separate company that will need to find office and shop space and hire staff, he said.More than 100,000 people are estimated to have lost their jobs in the Canadian oilpatch over the last two years as prices have plunged due to a glut of North American oil and gas \u2014 attributed in part to higher production from fracked wells.Sanjel announced in early April that it would enter court protection from creditors while negotiating the sale of its Canadian oilfield services assets to Step and similar assets in the United States to Denver-based Liberty Oilfield Services.No financial details were given initially but a subsequent court filing by Sanjel revealed that the total expected return was between $325 million and $375 million, less than the $397 million owed to its secured lending syndicate led by Alberta bank ATB Financial. That makes any recovery unlikely for unsecured suppliers and bondholders owed about $400 million.Sanjel leases most of its office and shop space from MacBain Properties. The firm is owned by the MacDonald family that also owns Sanjel but was not included in the Step purchase. Don MacDonald founded Sanjel in 1982.Sanjel was among the largest five providers of pressure pumping services operating in Canada. Their crews inject liquids and sand under high pressure into underground formations to break up the rock and allow trapped oil and gas to flow into the well.The procedure is called hydraulic fracturing or fracking and has been opposed by critics who fear it may taint potable water sources.Step is a private company created in 2011 with the backing of Calgary energy investment firm ARC Financial Corp.', u'NHL player posts letter on personal impact of Fort McMurray wildfireEDMONTON \u2013 As the St. Louis Blues continue their run\xa0in the Stanley Cup playoffs, Scottie Upshall\u2019s thoughts have been with his home community of Fort McMurray and the people affected by the wildfires.On Wednesday, the Blue\u2019s forward posted a letter on \xa0explaining the personal impact the wildfires have had on him and his family.In the letter, Upshall writes that he learned about the extent of the impact of the wildfires as he was getting ready to play one of the biggest games of his career: a game 3 match-up against the Dallas Stars in the second round of the playoffs.Upshall\u2019s mother and three nieces were among the thousands of Fort McMurray residents who had to evacuate the city to escape the fires.\u201cI just freaked out. I knew my mom was there alone with the girls,\u201d the NHL veteran explains.\u201cWhen I got to the arena, I was a mess. I was on my phone during warm-ups, which I never, ever do. I just couldn\u2019t get it out of my head that my mother was at home with three little girls.\u201dHis mother and nieces got out of Fort McMurray safely, but Upshall explains he\u2019ll never forget seeing images\xa0of people escaping the city.The wildfires have destroyed about 2,400 structures in Fort McMurray and as of Wednesday morning the city continues to be threatened by fire.Upshall is now using his platform to let people know his home town is much more than a\xa0\u201cboomtown that\u2019s all about big business,\u201d as it\u2019s been depicted by some.\u201cIt\u2019s a real community that desperately needs help rebuilding,\u201d Upshall write.In his letter, Upshall includes a story about\xa0the time\xa0residents rallied to help his peewee hockey team raise thousands of dollars for\xa0the team\u2019s trip to a Quebec tournament that is among the most highly touted in the world, which the team won.\u201cWithout their kindness and sense of community, we simply could not have raised enough money to go.\u201dUpshall ends the letter by calling on local businesses and companies to spearhead efforts to rebuild and letting readers know not to \u201ccount out my town.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire\u2019s return stalls Alberta oilsands recoveryCALGARY \u2014 Plans to quickly restart oilsands production in northern Alberta were turned upside down Tuesday after the , forcing thousands of workers to scramble to safety.Oilsands miners  to begin the process of resuming production at facilities undamaged by fire but shut down because of the threat.However, a change in wind direction sent the rapidly moving blaze north toward oilsands projects Monday afternoon, , according to the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo.Brion Energy, a company owned by Chinese giant PetroChina, said it evacuated 106 people from two work camps at the construction site of its MacKay River thermal oilsands project.The company had reduced its workforce from about 400 to 32 as a precautionary measure about two weeks ago but it began bringing them back in the past week as the fire moved farther away, said Brion spokeswoman Kristi Baron.Baron said the fire\u2019s change of direction came as a surprise and will likely delay first production.\u201cWe were nearing mechanical completion and aiming for first steam in the fall \u2014 until the fire,\u201d she said.Syncrude Canada said more than 200 of its workers who were part of a team that was supposed to restart production were moved twice on Monday \u2014 first from a work camp to its Mildred Lake mine north of Fort McMurray, then by bus to Edmonton when the evacuation order was extended.About 100 employees were left to maintain and stabilize operations at Mildred Lake and Syncrude\u2019s Aurora mine site 35 kilometres farther north, said spokesman Will Gibson.Suncor Energy said Monday night it was moving personnel from work camps and its base plant to other camps farther north, adding that it had started a staged and orderly shutdown of base plant operations.On Tuesday, the company also evacuated its Firebag and MacKay River thermal project sites as winds pushed the fire closer.In Ottawa, Natural Resource Minister Jim Carr said he\u2019d speak again with oil company representatives in the next day or two but had no update on what the changing fire conditions implied for the resumption of production.\u201cIt\u2019s important that the production come back on line and they were in good shape until these blazes began to reform,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching it very carefully.\u201dHe said the industry has not asked for federal assistance.Premier Rachel Notley said the oilsands companies know best when to restart their operations and the province will work with them to ensure that is done safely.She said it\u2019s too early for the provincial government to adjust its budget in light of reduced oilsands royalties.Earlier Tuesday, the Conference Board of Canada released a study on the anticipated economic impact of the fire, though that was before the change in the fire\u2019s direction and based on the presumption that production would be back up by the end of the month.The report estimated average oilsands output would fall by 1.2 million barrels of oil a day for two weeks, translating into $985 million in lost gross domestic product.\u201cAs far as I understand, most of the evacuations have been preventative, so it\u2019s still possible we will see production ramp up as expected,\u201d said Pedro Antunes, deputy chief economist with the conference board.The board expects rebuilding efforts to add roughly $1.3 billion in real GDP to Alberta\u2019s economy next year and construction in the region is expected to be higher than normal in 2018 and possibly 2019.The economic issue identified by the board is \u201cbig and it is serious,\u201d Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said.\u201cIt will clearly have a dampening effect on the economy,\u201d he said, though he added it is premature to calculate the fiscal impact on the federal budget.', u'Blame Canada, Nigeria: Oil prices hit 6-month highsThe price of a barrel of oil has hit its highest level in nearly seven\xa0months \u2014 nearly US$50 a barrel \u2014\xa0thanks mainly to supply reductions caused by unrest in Nigeria and the .U.S. crude prices rose by 43 cents a barrel Tuesday morning to US$48.15 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent Crude, used to price international oils rose to US$49 a barrel in London on Tuesday morning.That\u2019s the highest level since Nov. 3, 2015.On Monday, prices were up $1.51, propelling New York and Toronto stock markets to big gains.The recovery in the price of oil towards $50 a barrel is being viewed by stock investors as a sign of an improving global economy. Jitters over the outlook had been one of the reasons why oil fell to 14-year lows of about $26 a barrel in February.The price of oil has jumped by 85 per cent since hitting those multi-year lows.The current surge in prices comes amid a big drop in Nigerian oil production. Attacks by militants on oil installations in the Niger Delta region have cut output to 1.4 million barrels a day. The Nigerian government\u2019s budget is based on production of 2.2 million barrels a day.Here in Canada, the shutdown of oilsands operations because of the Fort McMurray wildfire has also led to a big drop in oil production. The Conference Board of Canada estimates that the fire has led to a  of oil a day for two weeks.That works out to a loss of almost $1 billion in production \u2013 or a cut of about 0.33 per cent in Alberta\u2019s gross domestic product for this year.\u2014\xa0', u'Nearly $1B of oilsands production lost due to Fort McMurray, Alta., fire: reportCALGARY \u2013 A new assessment of the economic impact of the Fort\xa0McMurray wildfires says close to $1 billion of oilsands production\xa0has been lost.The Conference Board of Canada estimates that the fire in\xa0northeastern Alberta resulted in a loss of 1.2 million barrels of\xa0oil per day for two weeks, translating into $985 million in lost\xa0gross domestic product.That represents about 0.33 per cent of Alberta\u2019s projected GDP\xa0this year and 0.06 per cent of Canada\u2019s projected GDP.Twelve oilsands operations were shut down and several more\xa0curtailed output this month because of the wildfire that closed\xa0pipelines and forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people from\xa0the area.The Conference Board based its estimates on the assumption that\xa0most oilsands operations are active again by the end of the month,\xa0though that was before a new evacuation was ordered Monday that\xa0covered several oilsands sites.The board estimates that the wildfire will reduce GDP growth in\xa0Alberta by one per cent in the second quarter but that will reverse\xa0into a one per cent gain in the third quarter as oilsands production\xa0resumes and rebuilding begins.', u'Hudson\u2019s Bay heads to the Netherlands to open 20 new storesTORONTO \u2013 Hudson\u2019s Bay Company has announced plans to open up to 20 new stores in the Netherlands as part of its European expansion.The company said it is in the process of finalizing long term leases and expected to open the first locations in the summer of 2017 under the Hudson\u2019s Bay and Saks Off 5th banners.It was just last month that North America\u2019s oldest retailer unveiled a blueprint for a major overseas expansion, starting with plans to open 40 Saks Off 5th discount stores in Germany, beginning next year.Hudson\u2019s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor and Hudson\u2019s Bay department stores, had purchased the largest department chain in Germany and Belgium, Galeria Kaufhof, for $3.9 billion last year.Olivier Van den Bossche, the head of HBC\u2019s European business, said the Netherlands expansion is expected to create some 2,500 construction jobs and an equal number of positions in the stores.The store openings are part of a nearly $1.5 billion investment HBC plans on pumping into its European properties over the next seven years, including renovations to its Kaufhof stores.\u201cExpansion into the Netherlands is a natural extension of our existing presence in Belgium as well as our planned entry into Luxembourg and will complete our presence in all of the Benelux countries,\u201d said HBC chairman Richard Baker in a statement.', u'Companies propose deep-water wind farms off Hawaii shoresHONOLULU \u2013 As Hawaii pushes to meet its aggressive renewable energy goals, two companies have proposed offshore wind turbine projects for federal waters off Oahu.Their plan would use technology that floats the massive turbines in deep waters miles offshore. The offshore turbine proposals are in the early stages, and would face years of environmental reviews and community meetings before possible approval.The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency that would decide whether to approve ocean leases for the projects, held a meeting about the proposals Monday.Two companies are proposing offshore wind farms. A.W. Hawaii Wind, a Texas company that\u2019s a subsidiary of Denmark-based Alpha Wind Energy, is proposing two offshore floating wind farms, each generating about 400 megawatts of energy with 50 turbines. One is proposed for the northwest side of Oahu 12 miles off the coast of Kaena Point, in waters about a half-mile deep. The company also is proposing a wind farm in waters 17 miles south of Diamond Head.A second company, Progression Hawaii Offshore Wind, is proposing a 400 megawatt wind farm using 40 to 50 floating turbines off Oahu\u2019s South Shore, in waters that are also about a half-mile deep.Hawaii has set a goal for its utilities to use 100 per cent renewable energy by the year 2045. Offshore wind farms could help the state meet that goal, said Mark Glick, energy administrator for the Hawaii State Energy Office.\u201cWe have to figure this out together, because the low-hanging fruit has been collected, and essentially the tougher decisions are before us\u2026the next steps are going to be crucial,\u201d Glick said.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Rebuilding should start rebound in Q3, economist saysThe vast, terrifying wildfire that  and surrounding communities left 2,400 homes and other buildings destroyed \u2013 and many more damaged and uninhabitable.Rebuilding Fort McMurray will mean an enormous amount of work, and require vast amounts of building materials and household goods.And starting about the middle of the year, the huge project will start to refloat the regional economy, economists predict. But the scale and complexity of the effort means it will take some time to get going.\u201cThere is a lot of work that has to be done before residents can come back, prior to any kind of reconstruction taking place. Most of that is really only going to begin in Q3, and probably last for several months, and probably into 2017,\u201d Michael Dolega, a senior economist at TD, said.The second quarter of 2016 will show the brutal effects of the oil slump and the wildfire on Alberta\u2019s economy, but the picture will change after that, he says.\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s a fair bit of labour-intensive work that has to be done in order to make this happen will help take up some of the slack that has opened up as a result of the decline in oil prices, and lower investment.\u201d(Measures of economic activity, like GDP, don\u2019t measure the loss of wealth that results from a natural disaster, but do measure the \xa0that goes with reconstruction.)\u201cIt\u2019s typically what you see after these types of events, that the reconstruction and resettling efforts do tend to offset the impacts,\u201d fellow TD economist\xa0Brian DePratto said.Estimates of how much the wildfire will cost the insurance industry run in the .

The 30-year-old drug, Syprine, was acquired by Valeant in 2010 and has since seen its price increased more than 3,000 per cent.Valeant board member Bill Ackman, a major shareholder with Pershing Square Capital, told a Senate committee late last month that he would urge the board to offer discounts on four drugs to address the company\u2019s aggressive pricing practices.The ranking Democrat on a House committee that also conducted hearings called the changes a \u201csmall step in the right direction.\u201d\u201cSlightly trimming their massive price increases now still forces our nation\u2019s hospitals to pay millions of dollars more each year,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings said in a news release.The price changes announced Monday were recommended by a internal committee of Valeant employees, including doctors, scientists and executives.New chairman and CEO Joseph Papa said under a new program previously implemented discounts for the drugs will be \u201csimplified and more accessible.\u201d', u'Nintendo plans to sell stake in Seattle Mariners, get into movie businessTOKYO \u2013 Japanese video game maker  is eyeing the movie business for growth.Company spokesman Makoto Wakae said Monday details are undecided but the work might be a theatre release or a DVD.Nintendo, which makes the Wii U home console and Nintendo 3DS hand-held machine, has licensed its game characters in the past, such as with its Pokemon movies, but it is now thinking about make its own film content.It won\u2019t become a full-fledged film studio, but filmmaking is one area it has chosen for future investment of proceeds from selling its stake in the major league Seattle Mariners, planned for later this year, according to Kyoto-based Nintendo.The Japanese daily newspaper Asahi reported Monday that Nintendo\u2019s work might be 3-D animation. It said Nintendo is in talks with various film companies on a possible partnership.Wakae said an announcement will be made, but even the details of the Mariners sale have not yet been announced.Nintendo has seen its growth stagnate in recent eyes amid competition from smartphones and other devices, and films could revive interest in its franchise, which also includes .Nintendo reported a 24 billion yen ($216 million) loss for January-March, bigger than the loss it reported the previous year.

That\u2019s keeping listings off the markets at a time when they are already in short supply.\u201dStill, CREA says sales in April were up year-over-year in about 70 per cent of all local markets compared with a year ago, boosted by B.C. and the Toronto region.Compared with March, sales were up 3.1 per cent in April, while new listings declined 0.2 per cent.Month-to-month figures for Vancouver and Toronto suggest the two frothy markets may be starting to cool, CREA president Cliff Iverson said.In the greater Vancouver area, April sales were virtually flat from the previous month \u2014 up a meagre 0.1 per cent \u2014 while in greater Toronto sales climbed 3.2 per cent on a month-to-month basis.That comes on the heels of a tepid March, when Vancouver and Toronto saw sales fall 0.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, from February.TD economist Diana Petramala says the data suggests that new federal rules that came into effect in mid-February and require larger down payments for homes between $500,000 and $1 million have had some impact on the two markets.\u201cActivity was down or flat in both for the second consecutive month, suggesting that a soft-landing may be in store for these red-hot markets,\u201d Petramala said in a note.\u201cNationally, the effect of the new rules appears to be more than offset by low interest rates. After edging up in the early part of the year, Canadian mortgage rates came back down to record low levels again by March.\u201dThe national average price for homes sold in April rose 13.1 per cent from a year ago to $508,097.Excluding the greater Vancouver and greater Toronto markets, the average price was $369,222, up 8.7 per cent from April 2015.The national sales-to-new listings ratio rose to 64.5 per cent in April, the ratio\u2019s tightest reading since October 2009.Follow @alexposadzki on Twitter.', u'\u2018It\u2019s more a passion than a job\u2019: Canadian trucking industry struggles to attract driversMONTREAL \u2013 After 40 years as a truck driver, Jack Fielding says it\u2019s easier to name the places in North America where he hasn\u2019t been than the ones he has.And after driving five million kilometres, the 57 year-old still enjoys the freedom of the road.\u201cFor the most part, there\u2019s nobody looking over my shoulder telling me what to do,\u201d says Fielding, who hails from McKellar, Ont. \u201cI have an assignment and I\u2019m left to do it at my own pace and how I think it should be done.\u201dBut as Fielding and thousands like him near retirement age, the industry is struggling to recruit young people who share his enthusiasm for the job.This means the industry is facing a looming labour shortage that could reach 48,000 drivers by 2024, according to the Canadian Trucking Alliance.The average age of a truck driver is over 47 \u2013 up from 45 in 2013 \u2013 and almost 30 per cent of the driving force is 55 or over, which makes it one of the oldest workforces in Canada, according to the organization\u2019s president.\u201cTens of thousands of them are nearing retirement and we\u2019re not getting anywhere near our commensurate share of new drivers into the business,\u201d says David Bradley.There are multiple reasons for the looming shortage, but many believe the lifestyle simply isn\u2019t attractive to a younger generation.Fielding, for example, usually works 10-14 days straight, with three days off between trips. Schedules are not set in advance, and drivers often work 12 hours or more a day.\u201cYou\u2019re not home with your friends on Friday nights having parties,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have a family you might miss out on birthdays and things like that.\u201dBradley says this makes it harder to attract younger people or those with families, who tend to place a higher emphasis on work-life balance than older generations.It may also explain why the industry struggles to recruit women, who make up only about four to six per cent of the driving population.Nadine Gauthier, who spent six years driving shipping containers in and around the Montreal area, is trying to change that.The 43-year old, now a supervisor for Simard Transport, also works on behalf of Quebec\u2019s trucking association to convince girls and women that trucking isn\u2019t just a \u201cman\u2019s world.\u201dShe says that while the first women \u201cpioneers\u201d may have been given a hard time, the industry has become very welcoming to women.\u201cI sincerely think men like having women in their teams and at the heart of the company,\u201d she notes. \u201cIt brings a new dynamic, and men are very respectful of that.\u201dThe average salary for a truck driver was listed as $40,728 in 2011, although Bradley says long-haul truck drivers can easily make $70-80,000 a year.However, they\u2019re often paid by the mile, which means their income can fluctuate based on unexpected delays or traffic. They also tend to work longer hours than the rest of the population.It\u2019s also difficult to hire immigrants, except under the Temporary Foreign Worker program, since truck driving is not considered a skilled occupation and drivers therefore aren\u2019t eligible for most federal economic immigration programs.Bradley says the current economic downturn in Canada \u2013 particularly in the oil industry \u2013 has alleviated the shortage for the moment.But he believes long-term solutions are needed to ensure people who enter the profession stay there, instead of viewing it as a stop-gap between jobs.The industry is working to change the classification of truck driving to semi-skilled or skilled, which Bradley says is key to getting more resources for training and attracting career-oriented candidates.Provinces are also working on implementing their own regulations and mandatory training standards.In its own bid to address the shortage, the Quebec government has introduced a training program for 17-and-18 year old wannabe truckers.Students are partnered with companies that agree to give them internships at the end of the four-month course, which often lead to permanent jobs.One recent graduate, 20-year-old Anthony Boisvert, was hired straight out of school and already has two years under his belt as a long-distance trucker for Groupe Robert.He loves the job, including the 60-80 hour workweeks and stretches of four to five days away from home, but realizes it isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201cIt\u2019s more a passion than a job,\u201d he says.Bradley says that although individual companies are looking at scheduling, wages and recruitment strategies to tackle the shortage, change is slow to come.\u201cThis is a fragmented, competitive industry, and it\u2019s hard to turn it on a dime,\u201d he says.Fielding, who estimates he has five years of driving left, can\u2019t quite figure out why more young people don\u2019t seem to want to take over behind the wheel.\u201cWhere (else) can you get paid to see North America, to experience things in life?\u201d he says. \u201cI think it would be a great job for somebody just starting out.\u201d', u'Big pension funds and Ottawa look to partner and fund billions in infrastructureOTTAWA \u2013 The Trudeau government\u2019s newfound enthusiasm about a big Montreal transit proposal has given Canadians a glimpse at one way Ottawa could fund billions in public infrastructure, like roads, bridges and rail, over the long haul.In recent days, senior Liberals have been talking up an unusual funding model for the $5.5-billion light-rail plan for Montreal, calling for a partnership that includes Ottawa and a public pension fund.The idea was put forward by Quebec\u2019s massive public pension fund manager, which recently announced its proposal to build a large electric rail network connecting Montreal to its suburbs.The fund, the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, is prepared to pump $3 billion into the project \u2013 and it wants the provincial and federal governments to kick in the rest.A subsidiary of the Caisse would operate the rail network and gradually recoup the pension plan\u2019s investment through user fees. Eventual profits would be funnelled into Quebecers\u2019 public nest egg \u2013 the Quebec Pension Plan \u2013 which is managed by the Caisse.The idea was made public after the Liberal government signalled in its March budget that it would like to engage deep-pocketed pension funds and other \u201cinnovative sources of funding\u201d to help raise much-needed cash for long-term infrastructure projects \u2013 when it\u2019s in the public interest.So far, this first example of a potential federal partnership with a major pension plan appears to have stoked excitement among senior Liberal cabinet ministers.\u201cI salute the innovative efforts of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which, through its metropolitan electric network, is proposing a new business model to implement major infrastructure projects,\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau told a business crowd late last week in Montreal.\u201cWe have the chance in Canada to count on pension funds that have developed an expertise in infrastructure that is recognized around the world.\u201dMorneau added that Ottawa is studying the Caisse\u2019s plan with \u201clots of interest.\u201dHis inaugural budget followed through on a Liberal election pledge to double infrastructure spending over the next 10 years, raising the overall federal investment to $120 billion.The party has argued boosting infrastructure spending will increase productivity, generate more long-term growth and create jobs.The plan, however, comes at a cost.Infrastructure spending is expected to contribute to a string of five-straight budgetary deficits that could add more than $110 billion to Canada\u2019s public debt.Seeking out other sources of cash for infrastructure could increase the number of new investments while helping prevent the country from sliding even deeper into the red.The first phase of the Liberal plan calls for $11.9 billion of spending over five years. It\u2019s focused on projects such as repairing aging water and public transit infrastructure as well as providing cash for smaller projects that can be completed by 2019.There\u2019s also money available for planning larger, more-ambitious projects that would be part of the program\u2019s second phase, the details of which have yet to be unveiled.That\u2019s where the Caisse\u2019s light-rail plan comes in \u2013 it features a type of funding model the government could increasingly tap into.Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi told the Senate\u2019s question period last week that the timing of the government\u2019s second phase aligns with the Montreal proposal. He added that the government is working \u201cvery closely\u201d with the Caisse.\u201cThis is one of the most innovative and creative projects that I have seen in my short while in this portfolio, and it will be transformative for the region of Montreal,\u201d Sohi said.\u201cI see this as a great opportunity for us to support innovation in delivery of infrastructure, because we do need to engage public sector pension funds, as well as private sector funds, to make sure the amount of infrastructure that we build across the country engages other stakeholders and partners.\u201dIn their remarks last week, both Sohi and Morneau complimented Caisse CEO Michael Sabia, whom Morneau has named to his economic advisory council.The council, tasked with helping the government map out a long-term growth plan, also features another head of a powerful public pension plan: Mark Wiseman, president and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.The groups will meet for the first time Monday north of Ottawa. Morneau and Sohi will both be among several cabinet ministers present at the meeting.Large Canadian pension plans, such as the Caisse and CPPIB, have invested billions in infrastructure projects abroad. Funds like these covet access to the reliable, predictable returns that infrastructure offers through revenue streams such as user fees, like tolls.In its budget, the Liberals also mentioned something called \u201casset recycling,\u201d a system that could see governments in Canada lease or sell stakes in existing major public assets such as highways, rail lines, and ports.Wiseman has praised asset recycling as a model Canada could use to attract long-term capital as it deals with its growing infrastructure deficit.Sabia has argued that opening the door to pension plans to make more infrastructure investments in Canada would create a win-win scenario.\u201cEvery time you take the train, every time you buy a ticket, obviously it is a contribution to your retirement fund,\u201d Sabia said last month after he announced the Montreal rail proposal.', u'52 climate activists arrested in Washington railroad protestSEATTLE \u2013 Authorities cleared the railroad tracks of protesters and arrested 52 climate activists Sunday morning in Washington state, after a two-day shutdown.About 150 people spent the night in tents and sleeping bags on the tracks near two refineries in northwest Washington, according to BNSF Railway spokesman Gus Melonas.They were asked to leave at about 5 a.m. and most gathered their belongings and left the area near Anacortes, Melonas said.\u201cIt was peaceful,\u201d he said. \u201cEighty per cent removed their belongings and cleared out.\u201dThe 52 people arrested were cited for trespassing, according to the Skagit County Department of Emergency Management. One person was also cited for resisting arrest.Skagit County Sheriff Will Reichardt said that before anyone was arrested, officers advised protesters that they could move to another designated location and demonstrate.A spokeswoman for the protesters said she expected everyone arrested would be processed and released from police custody.Emily Johnston said protests would continue around Anacortes on Sunday, but she didn\u2019t expect people to return to the railroad tracks.Johnston, who had participated in a blockade of the Seattle harbour to protest Shell Oil\u2019s plans to drill for oil in the Arctic, said the success of protests like the one in Anacortes can mostly be seen in the way they inspire people to speak out about climate change.\u201cPeople power matters,\u201d Johnston said.She also spoke about the contrast between arresting people for protesting about saving the planet and the lack of government action against the fossil fuel industry.\u201cWe really need to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable,\u201d Johnston said.The rail line has been closed since Friday because of the protests, and trains will begin running again Sunday afternoon after a cleanup and safety sweep of the tracks, he said.Protesters in kayaks, canoes, on bikes and on foot also took place in demonstrations near Anacortes, about 70 miles north of Seattle, to demand action on climate and an equitable transition away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal.Hundreds marched to the refineries Saturday and a smaller group blocked the railroad, all demanding energy policy changes. The railroad knew about the protest in advance and rerouted rail traffic to avoid the area.The railroad spur provides rail transportation for the nearby Shell and Tesoro oil refineries, as well as animal feed and other products.The protests are part of a series of global actions calling on people to \u201cbreak free\u201d from dependence on fossil fuels. Similar demonstrations were held around the country during the weekend.In upstate New York, climate activists gathered Saturday at a crude-oil shipment hub on the Hudson River in an action targeting crude-by-rail trains and oil barges at the Port of Albany. A group of activists sat on tracks used by crude oil trains headed to the port. Albany is a key hub for crude-by-rail shipments from North Dakota\u2019s Bakken Shale region.In Washington state, organizers targeted two refineries that are among the top sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the state. Tesoro has started shipping Bakken crude oil to its refinery, and Shell is proposing an expansion project that would similarly bring in Bakken crude oil by train.Officials with Shell and Tesoro said in earlier statements that they respect the right of people to demonstrate peacefully, and that safety is their highest priority.Crowd estimates of Saturday\u2019s march ranged from several hundred to about 1,000 people, Skagit County spokeswoman Bronlea Mishler said.Bud Ullman, 67, who lives on Guemes Island, participated in the march, which he described as good-spirited, peaceful.\u201cThe scientists are right. We have to get away from our dependence on fossil fuels, and it has to be done in a way that takes into serious consideration the impact on workers, families and communities,\u201d he said.Many of the nearly 40 groups involved in organizing the event also participated in large on-water kayak protests against Shell\u2019s Arctic oil drilling rig when it parked last year at a Seattle port.____AP reporter Phuong Le contributed to this report.', u'No winning ticket for Friday\u2019s $12M Lotto Max jackpotTORONTO \u2013\xa0 Moans, mumblings and mutterings were heard across the land as\xa0Canadians checked in vain for winning lottery numbers from last\xa0night\u2019s Lotto Max draw.No winning ticket was sold for Friday night\u2019s $12 million Lotto Max jackpot.That means the grand prize for next Friday\u2019s draw on May 20 will be an estimated $17 million.Earlier this month a $50 million dollar Lotto Max jackpot was won by a ticket holder in Quebec.', u'Why Canadians use less cash \u2013 but more $100 billsCanadians aren\u2019t using cash for small transactions like they used to \u2013 but demand for $100 bills has never been higher.Though most of us rarely handle one, Bank of Canada statistics show that there are 11.5 $100 bills in circulation for every Canadian, up from six in 2003.So where are they all? And what are they being used for?\u201cWe assume that it\u2019s a question of illegal transactions, or the underground economy, but we don\u2019t have the data to prove those assumptions,\u201d says\xa0Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins Group.Decisions by the Bank of Canada about how many notes to print in what denominations are based on requests from the banks, which in turn reflect demand from bank customers.Desjardins says the rise in demand for $100 bills is a mixture of the shadow economy \u2014 otherwise legal transactions like paying a tradesperson or employee in cash \u2014 illegal transactions and hoarding of cash.\u201cA plausible explanation would be the combination of low interest rates (which reduces the opportunity cost of holding cash) and higher demand for precautionary holdings on the part of the public, given the recent oil shock and heightened uncertainty regarding returns from financial market investments,\u201d Bank of Canada spokesperson\xa0Josianne M\xe9nard wrote in an e-mail.A 2012 \xa0by Statistics Canada to measure the underground economy reached the conclusion that it was \xa02.5 per cent of GDP. That proportion has been steady since the early 1990s, but has grown in real terms.In the StatsCan study, construction was believed to be the biggest sector of Canada\u2019s underground economy, which will not surprise anyone who has discussed a cash discount for home improvement with a contractor.Other Western countries have seen similar trends.\xa0In the United States, the value of $100 bills in circulation has roughly quintupled since the mid-1990s.In February, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers came out in favour of phasing out the country\u2019s\xa0$100 bill.\u201cI\u2019d guess the idea of removing existing notes is a step too far. But a moratorium on printing new high denomination notes would make the world a better place,\u201d he in the Washington Post.The Bank of England has seen growth in banknotes mostly in the \xa320 (C$37) and\xa0\xa350 (C$92) notes. A 2015 \xa0estimated that as many as half of the British banknotes in circulation were either outside the country or used in the shadow economy.(The amount of cash in the British economy \xa0noticeably when the Value Added Tax, a sales tax similar to the GST, was raised to 20 per cent in 2010.)\xa0Should governments stop printing higher-denomination notes? Several countries have debated it.\u201c(High-denomination) notes are the preferred payment mechanism of those pursuing illicit activities, given the anonymity and lack of transaction record they offer, and the relative ease with which they can be transported and moved,\u201d the authors of a paper published earlier this year by Harvard. \u201cBy eliminating high denomination, high value notes we would make life harder for those pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption.\u201dThe Harvard paper\u2019s main author, British banker Peter Sands, also came out for phasing out\xa0the British \xa350 note:The Bank of Canada \xa0$1,000 bills in 2000 at the RCMP\u2019s urging because they were only used for crime. But just under 800,000 of those bills are still out there, the Bank of Canada told Global News. They are to be\xa0circulating internally in the criminal economy.Earlier in May, the European Central Bank that it will phase out the 500-euro note, worth C$734. Much like the old Canadian $1,000 bill, it has a reputation for connections with crime, although privacy-minded Germans, who prefer \xa0transactions, resisted the change.Canada  the $100 bill as recently as 2011, but Vachon\xa0thinks it may be time to get rid of it.\u201cIt may be time to talk about removing it, if we can prove that normal people don\u2019t use it as a way of payment.\u201d\xa0', u'Could mobile payments lead you to overspend? How to keep your budget in checkGoing to the store armed with a wallet full of debit and credit cards may soon be a thing of the past \u2013 at least, that\u2019s what the country\u2019s biggest banks are betting on.This week, the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions announced they had signed on to make Apple Pay \u2013  \u2013 available to debit and credit card holders, marking a big step for Canada\u2019s adoption of mobile payment technology.But while banks are selling mobile payments as a convenient and fast solution for consumers, financial experts warn there could be one big risk associated with digital wallets \u2013 overspending.\u201cThe move to digital wallets is another step removed from tangibility,\u201d said Jeff Berry, senior director of research and development at LoyaltyOne.\u201cAs consumers become more and more removed from cash transactions, the amount they spend tends to rise so we can expect to see an increase in spending among those who adopt Apple Pay.\u201dIt\u2019s the same warning we\u2019ve heard over and over again when it comes to credit cards \u2013 the less we use cash, the harder it is to keep track of what we are actually spending.But some experts say we could become even more reckless with overspending once those credit cards are stored on our smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s been suggested that we reach for our wallets and purses far less often than we reach for our phones, with some data showing smartphone users reach for their devices over 100 times per day,\u201d personal finance expert Preet Banerjee told Global News.This is especially concerning considering  have hit new highs in recent times To prevent this, Banerjee said consumers need to get back to what he calls \u201cpersonal finance 101\u201d \u2013 keeping a monthly budget.\u201cGone are the days where you would have to track all your paper receipts and bills to create a good record of your expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve figured out your monthly expenses you can get a better sense of how you are spending your money and where you want to make changes.\u201dThe good news is, most mobile wallet apps allow you to see your transaction history quite easily, which means \u2013 if you are diligent \u2013 you can gain a good sense of how much is being drained from your digital wallet.Another saving grace: Apple Pay and contactless payments (tap-to-pay debit and credit cards) are limited to transactions under $100. Although this is done for security and fraud prevention reasons, it also prevents you from mindlessly tapping away on big purchases.You may be more inclined to think twice about your purchase if you have to take the time to punch in your PIN.Experts also suggest downloading a budgeting app to help keep track of your spending habits. If you do notice your day-to-day spending is out of control, Banerjee said you might be better off shutting down your digital wallet, leaving your credit cards at home, or using cash to see how much you are actually spending.While setting and sticking to a budget is your responsibility, some experts believe banks and app makers should play a part in preventing the growth of consumer debt.\u201cI am a firm believer of consumers taking responsibility for their actions; however, having said that, they still need to have mechanisms in place that if they feel they are out of control of their spending that they have help,\u201d said Jeffrey Schwartz, executive director of For example, Schwartz suggested Apple could build in a feature to Apple Pay that allows the user to set a monthly budget for the cards they store in their digital wallet.', u'Loblaw recalls children\u2019s slippers due to choking hazardBRAMPTON, Ont. \u2013 Loblaw (TSX:L) is  Joe Fresh brand pre-walker Footlets in pink, navy and grey because of a choking hazard.The company says the slippers have a fabric at the back that could come loose and pose a choking hazard to children.Loblaw says there has been one reported case of the fabric detaching and there have been no reports of injury.The footwear were sold at several Loblaw-owned stores across the country since Feb. 12.The affected footlets, which bear the style code BGS6GW2045 or BBS6FW2039, have been removed from store shelves.Loblaw says customers can return the product to any store where Joe Fresh apparel is sold and they\u2019ll get a full refund.', u'Pfizer says it\u2019s blocking use of drugs for lethal injectionsPharmaceutical company Pfizer said Friday it was blocking use of its drugs in lethal injections, which means all federally-approved drugmakers whose medications could be used for executions have now put them off limits.\u201cPfizer makes its products to enhance and save the lives of the patients we serve. Consistent with these values, Pfizer strongly objects to the use of its products as lethal injections for capital punishment,\u201d the company said in the statement made public on its website Friday.The company\u2019s announcement has limited immediate impact. Its action is an enhancement of a previous policy that follows Pfizer\u2019s $15.23 billion purchase of Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira Inc. last year. Hospira had previously prohibited the use of its drugs in capital punishment, as have several other drugmakers.Pfizer shares closed even Friday at $33.19.The development means the approximately 25 FDA-approved companies worldwide able to manufacture drugs used in executions have now blocked the use of the drugs, according to Reprieve, a New York-based human rights organization opposed to the death penalty.Pfizer\u2019s announcement was unlikely to have much effect on executions, which have slowed in recent years as drugmakers\u2019 prohibition on the drugs took effect.However, as recently as last year, records showed that labels of Arkansas execution drugs appeared to indicate that the state\u2019s potassium chloride, which stops the heart, was made by Hospira. Pfizer spokeswoman Rachel Hooper said the company couldn\u2019t speculate on the impact of its decision.Ohio, which last executed an inmate in January 2014, has repeatedly pushed back executions while it looks for drugs. It now has more than two dozen inmates with firm execution dates, but no drugs to put prisoners to death with.Some remaining death penalty states have been using compounded versions of drugs that fall outside of FDA approval.Texas, with the country\u2019s busiest death chamber, obtains its pentobarbital for lethal injections from a supplier the state identifies only as a licensed compounding pharmacy. A law that took effect last year keeps the identity of the drug provider confidential. The state has carried out six executions so far in 2016. At least eight are scheduled for the coming months, including two in June.Texas is fighting a lawsuit trying to force it to identify drugmakers from April 2014, when attorneys unsuccessfully filed appeals to stop two executions by seeking the identity of the drug providers, and September 2015, when the state\u2019s secrecy law took effect.Similar lawsuits about whether states must identify their providers have been argued in states including Georgia, Arkansas and Missouri.There have been 14 executions in the U.S. so far in 2016 in five states: six in Texas, five in Georgia and one each in Alabama, Florida and Missouri. Last year, there were 28 in six states.Some states have passed laws allowing older methods of execution if needed.

New Zealand introduced a capital gains tax if a property is flipped within two years, while the U.K. doles out a capital gains tax of up to 28 per cent.It\u2019s too soon to fully assess the\xa0success of the new measures, the report cautions. However, in Australia foreign buyers of new homes have dropped from 16 per cent in Q3 of 2015 to the current rate of 12 per cent.While we wait for the numbers on foreign ownership in Canada, Ottawa could at the least start by applying a flipping fee, the report says.', u'\u2018They like having people in debt\u2019: Your payday loan storiesNick has loaned people money with the same bills those customers\xa0used to repay their delinquent loans moments earlier.Nick, who worked for multiple payday loan companies over the course of several years, was one of more than a dozen people who got in touch with Global News following  whose practices, she says, were making her sick.We got stories from people who loved working for payday loan companies and who hated it; who got badly needed cash to get them through a tough time and who found themselves taking out loans to repay loans for years on end.We\u2019ve used first names\xa0and initials\xa0because many of these people worry about repercussions if they talk about their jobs or their credit histories. to slash payday loan fees to the lowest in Canada.

The transaction is expected to close at the end of the month following regulatory approvals.Canadian Tire, which also owns athletic retailer Sport Chek and clothier Mark\u2019s, has invested \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in innovation over the past few years, but Medline says the company still believes in bricks-and-mortar stores that are exciting for the customer.That includes everything from renovating existing stores to be more interactive to incorporating virtual reality for customers to test out how tires feel in different driving conditions.\u201cWe have seen what happens to many retailers in Canada who have taken for granted their market position and then fallen by the wayside. In an age of unprecedented disruption, innovation must be central to everything we do. Digital disruption is happening on a scale larger than any of us could\u2019ve imagined. No industry, including retail, will be immune to those changes.\u201dOn Thursday, Canadian Tire reported net income attributed to shareholders of $66.5 million, down 2.9 per cent from $68.5 million in the same year-earlier period.Revenue rose 1.8 per cent to $2.56 billion from $2.51 billion.Same-store sales, an important metric in retail, grew one per cent at Canadian Tire; 7.6 per cent at FGL Sports, which runs Sport Chek; and 0.8 per cent at Mark\u2019s.', u'How do new Canadian neighbourhoods get named? Experts say it\u2019s about gentrificationEdmonton\u2019s naming committee wanted to call the new neighbourhoods Balsam Woods, Golden Willow and River Alder \u2013 names that pay homage to local tree species and the area\u2019s natural geography.But the city\u2019s executive council ultimately sided with the developers, who favoured The Uplands, Stillwater and River\u2019s Edge.Experts say the quarrel that came to a head in March highlights the growing role that marketability is playing in the naming of new neighbourhoods.\u201cNeighbourhoods used to be named based on their historical origins, but now it\u2019s much more geared towards creating something that sounds hip and cool,\u201d says Susannah Bunce, assistant professor of human geography and city studies at the University of Toronto Scarborough.\u201cThe naming of neighbourhoods can be part of a larger process of gentrification.\u201dCory Sousa, a planner on Edmonton\u2019s naming committee, says it\u2019s not surprising that the wishes of developers \u2013 who have invested big money and are looking for marketable names to help them sell properties \u2013 may sometimes clash with those of the committee.While developers are seeking names that roll off the tongue, the committee is striving to preserve the city\u2019s heritage and highlight the flora, fauna and geographic features of the area, says Sousa.Sousa points to the Big Lake area as an example, where an avian theme was used to name five neighbourhoods \u2013 Hawks Ridge, Kinglet Gardens, Pintail Landing, Starling and Trumpeter \u2013 due to the presence of hundreds of bird species in the area.In another region of the city called Pilot Sound, the committee tapped into Edmonton\u2019s aviation history and named the neighbourhoods after pilots.\u201cThose are the kinds of names that we really like to focus on \u2013 honouring all the great people that have done great things,\u201d says Sousa.Bunce says it should be the people who live and work in a particular neighbourhood who decide how it\u2019s named.\u201cThey are the ones who live there and have a stronger sense of identification with the place,\u201d she says.Barbara Lawlor, president of Baker Real Estate, a Toronto firm that markets and sells new condo developments, says names can affect not only property values but also the identities of local residents.\u201cPart of how we define ourselves is what area of town we live in,\u201d Lawlor says.\u201cWhen you say, \u2018I live in Yorkville,\u2019 people immediately know that you live in a tony neighbourhood and therefore you\u2019re doing well. Or if you say, \u2018I live on Queen Street East,\u2019 they know you\u2019re very trendy and cool.\u201dHowever, it takes time for a name to take on that sort of meaning, Lawlor adds.\u201cThe Bridle Path is one of our most prestigious areas, but if we didn\u2019t have mansions in that area it wouldn\u2019t be significant,\u201d says Lawlor. \u201cA name is just a name until it gathers that character and significance.\u201dSometimes, efforts to rebrand a neighbourhood can draw the ire of its residents \u2013 even when the original name carries with it negative associations.That was the case in 2008, when signs bearing the name \u201cUniversity Heights\u201d were plastered around Toronto\u2019s Jane and Finch intersection.Paul Nguyen, a longtime resident of Jane and Finch, says many community members were upset that money was being dunked into such a superficial fix.\u201cIt\u2019s like lipstick on a pig,\u201d says Nguyen, who founded the website Jane-Finch.com in 2004. \u201cMaking signs is not going to fix the fundamental problems in the community.\u201dMany residents also felt like the initiative was a rejection of their heritage, says Nguyen.\u201cJane and Finch is an identity,\u201d he says.\u201cIt\u2019s about overcoming obstacles, proving other people wrong, overcoming discrimination. \u2026 It\u2019s a badge of honour. A lot of people are proud of that label. It represents overcoming struggle.\u201d', u'Lowe\u2019s takesover of Quebec-based Rona approved by Competition BureauMONTREAL \u2013 The Competition Bureau has approved the .The federal agency says it has concluded the acquisition by the U.S. company won\u2019t limit consumer choice.The deal was overwhelmingly approved by Rona shareholders in March, but it also stirred some degree of nationalist sentiment, particularly from Pierre Karl Peladeau, the Parti Quebecois leader at the time.Lowe\u2019s entered the Canadian market in 2007 and had 42 stores in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario when the $3.2-billion deal was announced in February.Rona has 496 corporate and dealer-owned stores across Canada, including 238 in Quebec.The transaction, which is also subject to review under the Investment Canada Act, is expected to close by the end of May.\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'Alberta slashing payday loan fees to lowest in CanadaAlberta is reducing the maximum amount payday lenders can charge to the lowest in Canada and requiring these companies\xa0to give borrowers more time to pay back the money they owe.The provincial NDP tabled the draft legislation, , in the legislature Thursday. If passed, the bill would cut the maximum payday loan fee to $15 per $100, from $23. And that $15 would have to include any additional services such as insurance attached to the loan.It also requires lenders to give borrowers two pay periods in which to pay back the loan; right now, a borrower has until their next payday to do so.\u201cInterest rates that are 600 per cent or more are predatory,\u201d  said Thursday.It\u2019s a bold step as jurisdictions across Canada are trying to figure out how to rein in what many argue is an exploitative model that profits from people least able to pay.And this is just step one: Alberta wants to reduce the maximum payday loan fee even more, once there are enough alternatives out there for the people who need the service.That\u2019s where things could get tricky.As payday lenders argue, there\u2019s significant\xa0demand\xa0for the low-cost, short-term loans they provide, often to people whose credit isn\u2019t good enough to borrow money elsewhere. President Tony Irwin\xa0says\xa0the proposed\xa0regulations will leave these people without options.Albertans borrow about $500 million a year from payday loan companies, the government says. If these companies shutter stores because of the new rules \u2014 as  stringent regulations will make them do \u2014 the need will still exist.The bill would require McLean\xa0to monitor the market and report back to the legislature on emerging alternatives to payday lending. The plan is to further reduce maximum payday loan fees once there are enough options for people who\u2019ll need the cash.But it isn\u2019t clear how exactly the province will ensure those alternatives proliferate: First Calgary Financial and Momentum are expanding\xa0their , previously a pilot project, across the province\xa0in August.  has another alternative program rolling out at the end of this year.And as  notes, credit unions have existed for ages.But these services are still tiny compared to the payday loan industry.\u201cIt\xa0has [taken] and will continue to take some time to ensure that not only are those products available but that they\u2019re accessible and proliferated to\xa0the extent that Albertans need.\u201cI am confident that we will get to\xa0that point.\u201dWhile it\u2019s illegal in Canada to charge more than 60 per cent interest on a loan, short-term loans are exempt. Once you annualize the interest rate, a $23 fee on a $100 loan that\u2019s due in two weeks works out to about 552 per cent interest. A $15 fee in that same period works out to 360 per cent.The draft legislation would also require payday lenders to collect more information on their customers, and pass it on to the province so the government can get a better sense of who is borrowing money \u2014 where they live, what they make, how many loans, on average, they take out.The law would require lenders to give customers financial literacy material and give them the option of electronic paperwork and receipts.Payday loan companies have argued they need to charge high fees in order for their business model to function: a  found these companies have to charge at least $20.74 per $100.The loans they make are just too risky, and the chance of default too high, to charge less than that,\xa0Irwin said.Irwin doesn\u2019t like the two-instalment rule, either: He says that would mean\xa0\u201ca whole different type of lending product. It\u2019s not a product our members offer today.\u201d, argues it doesn\u2019t have to be that way: if small-scale loans are less onerous to pay back, she says, the default rate won\u2019t be as high.\u201cI don\u2019t see payday loans as high-risk loans,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019re putting skin in the game. We believe in this social issue. We believe we can make a positive impact.\u201d', u'US poultry workers forced to wear diapers on job: reportBOSTON \u2013 A report from international advocacy group Oxfam says poultry workers in the United States labour in a \u201cclimate of fear,\u201d with some forced to wear diapers on the job.It says many workers are afraid to ask for permission to go to the bathroom.

Recently, a lower Canadian dollar has made this proposition even more attractive,\u201d Soper said.In British Columbia, 83 per cent of respondents said sales have increased since January and nearly three-quarters feel that sales will continue to increase over the remainder of the year.However, in Alberta, 60 per cent of advisors said the sale of luxury properties has decreased since January 2015 and 64 per cent believe it will continue on a decline throughout the rest of the year.\u201cUnit sales in the luxury category have dropped slightly from last year\u2019s level,\u201d said John Hripko, real estate agent, Royal LePage Benchmark, in the report. \u201cRecently however, oil prices have inched higher, giving some agents and homeowners a renewed sense of optimism, causing inquiries for luxury properties in the $1 million to $2 million range to pick up. Demand for luxury properties above that price range has been slower, but consistent with the pace seen in 2015.\u201dAccording to the report, Ontario luxury properties remain a hot item as 76 per cent of advisors said the have seen an increase in activity since last January. Almost 70 per cents said there has been an increase in foreign buyer activity in the same 10-year period.However, in Quebec, though the luxury market \u201cremains relatively healthy,\u201d 58 per cent of advisors believe that less than 10 per cent of luxury properites are being purchased by foreign buyers.\u201cAmongst these transactions, prestigious homes remain most popular with local buyers, with a small proportion of these purchases being attributable to foreign buyers,\u201d said Marie-Yvonne Paint, real estate professional Royal LePage Heritage, in the report. \u201cIn the luxury apartment segment, the proportion of purchases made by foreign buyers is slightly higher.\u201d', u'B.C. is Canada\u2019s job vacancies hot spotLooking for a job?Employers in British Columbia are looking for people to fill them, released today by Statistics Canada show.B.C. had Canada\u2019s highest job vacancy rate \u2013 2.8 per cent \u2013 in the last quarter of 2015, followed by the Northwest Territories.Perhaps unexpectedly, Alberta had the second-highest\xa0job vacancy rate among provinces, at 2.5 per cent.Regionally,\xa0Banff-Jasper-Rocky Mountain House, Alta., had the country\u2019s highest job vacancy rate, followed by the B.C.

B.C. gained 13,000 jobs in April, even as hard-hit Alberta lost 21,000.And on Wednesday, a \xa0from BMO pointed out that Vancouver and Toronto had accounted for all of Canada\u2019s job growth over the last year.In April, a  from TD Economics said that people displaced by the crashing energy sector in Alberta and Saskatchewan had been migrating to British Columbia.', u'\u2018Technical error\u2019 forces temporary closure of some Loblaw stores across CanadaTORONTO \u2013 A computer glitch forced Loblaw to temporarily close a number of its stores Thursday morning, the grocery and pharmacy chain said.Company spokeswoman Catherine Thomas said the stores, most of which were in Atlantic Canada and Ontario, had issues completing sales as a result of the problem.The error affected grocery stores that operate under the Loblaw (TSX:L) banner, which include Loblaws, No Frills and the Real Canadian Superstore, but did not involve its Shoppers Drug Mart outlets or PC Financial banks.The problem arose after the company uploaded invalid information into its cash register system, causing it to stall temporarily, Thomas said.The issue was later fixed and all stores resumed operations, though checkout times may have been slower than normal, she said.Thomas added that the glitch only impacted cash register functions and did not compromise consumer data or credit card information.', u'Google is banning payday loan adsNEW YORK \u2013 Internet giant Google said Wednesday , calling the industry \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201charmful.\u201dGoogle\u2019s decision could have as much or even more impact on curtailing the industry than any move by politicians, as many payday loans start with a desperate person searching online for ways to make ends meet or cover an emergency.Effective July 13, Google will no longer allow ads for loans due within 60 days and will also ban ads for loans where the interest rate is 36 per cent or higher. The industry will join Google\u2019s other banned categories of ads, such as counterfeit goods, weapons, explosives, tobacco products and hate speech.\u201cOur hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,\u201d The ban would not impact companies offering mortgages, auto loans, student loans, loans for businesses or credit cards, Google said.Payday lenders have long been a target of criticism by politicians and consumer advocates, who argue the industry charges extremely high interest rates to customers, who are often the poor. Payday loans are often used to cover an unexpected expense or to make ends meet before the next paycheque. But for many borrowers, short-term loans wind up being difficult to pay off, leading to a cycle of debt that can drag on for months.A 2012 study by Pew showed the average payday borrower is in debt for five months, spending $520 in fees and interest to repeatedly borrow $375. The annual per cent rate on a payday loan is 391 per cent, according to Pew.Payday loan stores reap billions of dollars in interest and fees on a product designed to force borrowers into repeat loans. Google is to be praised for doing its part to limit use of these abusive loans.\u201dIn response to critics, the payday lending industry has long argued it provides a necessary financial service to people in need of emergency funds.\u201cThese policies are discriminatory and a form of censorship,\u201d said Amy Cantu, a spokeswoman with the Community Financial Centers Association of America, the trade group representing payday lenders.State legislatures have long looked for ways to target payday lenders, but the payday lending industry has often found ways around new regulations. When several states capped the interest rates on payday loans, the industry pivoted into loans tied to auto titles or moved their operations onto Indian reservations.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering new regulations to further restrict the payday lending industry. The rules are expected to be released later this year.In a way, Google\u2019s announcement will likely have more of an impact than any new regulation. Google fields about two out of every three Internet search requests in the U.S. and also controls the world\u2019s largest digital advertising network. Most of Google\u2019s ads are triggered by the search requests, relying on an automated system to select a marketing pitch mostly likely to be related to what a person is searching for.Under this ban, users searching for words like \u201cloans\u201d or \u201cplaces to get money\u201d will no longer pull up ads from payday lenders in the advertising section of the search results.Payday lending advertising is a small, but lucrative, part of Google\u2019s ad revenues, which totalled $67 billion last year. Pew calculated in 2014 that ads related to payday loans can bring in $4.91 to $12.77 per click.The price that advertisers are willing to pay for marketing pitches delivered by Google usually reflects how much money they stand to make from making a sale. Search terms tied to products with low profit markets might fetch only a few cents while words that indicate a consumer is mulling an expensive purchase command much higher rates.But the amount of impact it will have on the overall payday lending industry remains to be seen.In the much larger world of radio and TV advertising, payday lenders spent $277 million on radio and TV ads between June 2012 and May 2013, which would remain unaffected. Two-thirds of the revenue and loans generated in the industry is done at brick-and-mortar shops, as opposed to online payday loans, said Alex Horowitz, an expert on the payday lending industry at Pew.Google, and its parent company Alphabet, has had a history of corporate activism. The company\u2019s previous motto was \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d which was replaced with \u201cdo the right thing\u201d last year.', u'Protesters turn London\u2019s Trafalgar Square into \u2018tropical tax haven\u2019London\u2019s famous Trafalgar Square looked a little different Thursday morning, after several charities turned the busy landmark into a tropical \u201ctax haven\u201d\xa0\u2013 complete with beach chairs, pool floaties and even lobsters.The tropical oasis\xa0\u2013  \u2013 coincides with the\xa0London anti-corruption summit, taking place Thursday at\xa0London\u2019s Lancaster House. The meeting\xa0drew politicians from around the world, including the presidents of Afghanistan, Nigeria and Colombia, as well as representatives of financial institutions and civil-society organizations.\xa0Thursday morning many of the leaders\xa0vowed to open up corporate records, quash money laundering and end bribery in a bid to stamp out what British\xa0Prime Minister David Cameron called the global \u201ccancer\u201d of corruption.But many of the world\u2019s leading tax havens are British dependencies or overseas territories, including\xa0Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.The organizers behind Trafalgar Square\u2019s tropical tax haven are\xa0calling on Cameron to close the tax havens with British ties.\u201cDavid Cameron needs to act to tackle secrecy in the U.K.\u2019s overseas tax havens,\u201d Action Aid UK\u2019s head of campaigns\xa0Murray Worthy in a video posted to Twitter.In a move to greater transparency, Britain has passed a law requiring British companies \u2013 including foreign firms that own British property or seek government contracts \u2013 to disclose who really benefits from their ownership.\xa0Britain said the register meant that \u201ccorrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London\u2019s property market.\u201d\u2013', u'Oil prices surge to highest level so far this yearTORONTO \u2013 Crude climbed to its highest level so far this year as investors digested a surprising report on oil stockpiles in the U.S.The June contract for benchmark North American oil surged $1.57 to US$46.23 a barrel as the U.S. reported crude stockpiles declined by 3.4 million barrels last week. Analysts had been expecting an increase.The gain in oil helped lift energy companies on the S&P/TSX index, but the Toronto stock market ended the day little changed, up 13.02 points at 13,788.21.Meanwhile, the oil-sensitive Canadian dollar was solidly ahead, rising 0.39 of a U.S. cent to 77.81 cents US.Elsewhere in commodities, June gold rose $10.70 to US$1,275.50 a troy ounce while June natural gas was up two cents at US$2.17 per mmBtu. July copper added a penny to US$2.10 a pound.In New York, retail stocks weighed on the markets as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 217.23 points at 17,711.12.

Education Minister Doug Currie says every province is keen to create quality, affordable child-care spaces accessible to families that want them.He says the bilateral agreements with each province would outline the areas of federal investment in early learning and child care based on principles adopted by each province.The money tied to each provincial deal would likely top up a base amount of per capita funding to each province, much like the way social program money is doled out.Currie says larger provinces with larger populations may need federal help to build new day care centres.Smaller provinces like his may be more interested in using the money to expand existing centres.The Liberals promised a national program in their campaign platform, but didn\u2019t tie it to any specific targets. Instead, the party agreed to work with provinces to come up with a system that would create affordable spaces accessible to all families.The federal government promised to give $400 million next year to provinces and territories for child care. That was conditional on the provinces and federal government agreeing on a national child-care framework that would establish ground rules for federal involvement in what is an area of provincial jurisdiction.\u201cWe want to find ways to invest these limited resources in the most efficient manner and the most inclusive manner and that\u2019s why we have to talk very closely and very seriously with provinces and territories.\u201dNegotiations on the framework started in February, when Duclos met his provincial and territorial counterparts.Child-care advocates are closely watching the outcome of the talks, hoping to land a long-discussed national program that seemed a certainty in 2005, when the Paul Martin government came to agreements with provinces.The federal Liberals have said they want to create a program that takes into account the work provinces have done in the last 10 years.New research suggests most provinces were selective in the evidence they used in creating policies around early childhood education, specifically all-day kindergarten. A paper in the journal Canadian Public Administration says provinces outside Quebec looked at day care and kindergarten isolated from a broader family-based policy that experts say is needed for an integrated early childhood care and education system.Any federal child-care framework would have to invest in buildings, wage enhancements for early childhood educators, operating grants to day care centres and subsidies to either put fees on a sliding scale based on income, or eliminate them altogether, said Linda White, interim director of the school of public policy and governance at the University of Toronto.', u"\u2018We are loan sharks\u2019: Why one woman\u2019s leaving the payday loan businessYou don\u2019t ask people how much they want to borrow: You tell them how much you\u2019re lending them.That\u2019s one of the first things Kathy Durocher learned as a\xa0payday lending employee, she says.During a training session, \u201cI had said, \u2018Are you going to take another loan?\u2019 And the person said yes. And they told me how much. And my manager,\xa0in training, stopped me right after and said, \u2018No. You never ask. You tell them. You say, \u2018I\u2019m giving you this amount today.'\u201dDurocher claims she\u2019d be penalized for not loaning someone the maximum amount that person was eligible for. says most loan approval procedures are automated, and cites a study of transactions from three payday lending companies that found 62 per cent of borrowers in 2014 didn\u2019t borrow the maximum amount, and the average customer borrowed 68.1 per cent of the maximum.\u201cThis indicates that borrowers are aware of their financial circumstances and seek to borrow the specific amount they need,\u201d the  wrote in an email.After\xa0five years\xa0at two payday loan companies, working at locations across Calgary, Durocher is\xa0calling it quits.\u201cI can\u2019t go to work stressing that [if] I\u2019m not getting somebody in a deeper hole, that I\u2019ll get fired.\u201dIrwin, says his members\xa0provide an essential service, giving loans to people who need money and have no other way to get it.Alberta is  in the province before existing regulations expire next month. Ontario, Nova Scotia and other jurisdictions are pondering the same.Irwin says he and his members have been in touch with suggestions of their own.But he takes issue with the name Alberta\u2019s\xa0already given its bill: An Act to End Predatory Lending.\u201cThat name certainly would seem to be at odds with what this industry is.\u201dCanadian communities\xa0are hardly alone in wanting to rein in the payday loan industry.Google announced\xa0Wednesday that,\xa0. (In the U.S. only, it\u2019s also banning ads whose interest rate is 36 per cent or higher.)\u201cResearch has shown that these loans can result in unaffordable payment and high default rates for users,\u201d reads .\u201cThis change is designed to protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products.\u201d\u201cGovernments, consumer advocates and credit counsellors all say payday loans are a needed service,\u201d Irwin wrote in an email.Durocher\xa0sought out a job at a payday lender because of how much she\u2019d been helped by one before. When her dog George was hurt and she needed money for an emergency veterinary bill, a payday loan came through.She\u2019s since changed her mind.Durocher says one manager told her\xa0not to tell people out loud how much they would end up owing on the money they were taking out, but only to highlight the amount in paperwork.\u201cI was told not to tell them what the payback is \u2026 You\u2019re supposed to circle the amount they owe and the date and point [it out] to them as you\u2019re putting it through the window and say, \u2018This is what you owe and it\u2019s due December\xa022. for example.'\u201dDisclosure provisions are set out in regulations, Irwin said in an email, \u201cincluding a poster in the lobby that shows the cost of a typical $300 loan.People have a 24-hour window if they want to change their minds, Durocher said.Durocher hated having to call people when they were late repaying their loans.\u201cWe\u2019re told not to let them off the phone.\xa0We\u2019re told to say, \u2018I understand, but I need a date for you to pay,'\u201d she said.Durocher said she gets evaluated on whether customers come through on the payment\xa0promises they\xa0make over the phone.Collection practices are subject to regulations, Irwin said in an emailed statement.\u201cHaving said that these are small loans and lenders will want to have the borrower contact them before the due date if there is a problem so the loan can be extended rather than having a payment returned [\u2018not sufficient funds\u2019].It\u2019s gotten worse in Calgary since Christmas, Durocher says, as\xa0families squeezed by oil\u2019s free-fall turned to a longtime lender of last resort, only to find themselves unable to pay their debts.She says she\u2019s been cursed, spat at, threatened.Contrary to popular belief, Irwin says, payday lenders haven\u2019t cashed in on Canada\u2019s oilsands slump.\u201cPeople are in need more than ever. [But] if they\u2019re unemployed, they don\u2019t get a payday loan.\u201dMany payday lenders do make loans to people on social assistance, however. Irwin said each company makes that determination for themselves.Jurisdictions across North America are experimenting with payday lender regulations.One possibility pioneered in San Francisco is to limit the proliferation of payday loan locations through zoning regulations.Irwin would rather not see that happen.\u201cI\xa0don\u2019t think that\u2019s something where there should be limits imposed. And that\u2019s something\xa0customer demand will dictate.\u201dGlobal News maps based on tax statistics\xa0and business location information from  \xa0payday loan locations are disproportionately located in areas with lower-income residents or with a higher percentage of residents receiving social assistance. Irwin says there\u2019s no correlation: They\u2019re going where customers are, just like any other retailer.\u201cWe\u2019ve mapped where our members are located,\xa0and\xa0we find they\u2019re in all kinds of different areas, different incomes,\u201d he said.\u201cThe criteria that seems to be important is areas that have a lot\xa0of foot traffic; areas people can access, transportation corridors, downtown areas \u2014 where a lot of other retail businesses\xa0locate.\u201dIrwin likes Alberta\u2019s regulations as they stand.\xa0But his organization has made suggestions for whatever comes next.One recommendation they\u2019ve made to the Alberta, Ontario and Nova Scotia governments is for payday lenders to\xa0start offering a \u201cvoluntary extended payment plan\u201d that gives the borrower more time to pay back the loan and fee without accruing additional interest over that grace period.A \xa0found that the minimum their industry could charge per $100 payday loan is $20.74. Anything under that, Irwin said, and the business model\xa0doesn\u2019t work.\u201cA small-sum, short-term loan is expensive to provide.\u201dIf payday lenders were \u201cregulated out of existence,\u201d Irwin says, it would hurt people who don\u2019t have alternatives.\u201cWhere would our customers go if we weren\u2019t here, or if regulations were such that industry was reduced significantly?\u201dThat could make people turn to illegal lenders online, Irwin said.\u201cThey\u2019re going online and they\u2019re getting a payday loan from a company that\u2019s not licensed, not regulated, not complying with regulations \u2026 The consumer is definitely worse off.\u201d", u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Red Cross gives $50M, Alberta gives $100M in emergency fundingThe Red Cross will provide $50 million in emergency funds and the Alberta government will provide $100 million in\xa0emergency funding for thousands of Fort McMurray fire evacuees.On Wednesday, the\xa0Red Cross said each adult would receive $600 and each child would receive $300. The province previously announced it would provide $1,250 per adult and $500 per dependent.People who have given the Red Cross an email address will receive the funds through e-transfer in the next 24 to 48 hours. The Red Cross said if you didn\u2019t provide an email, they will reach out to you.\u201cNo matter where they are in Canada, we will reach out,\u201d Conrad Sauve, president and CEO of the Canadian Red Cross said.\xa0\u201cWe will take care of you wherever you are.\u201dHe\xa0called the emergency funding effort the most important and fastest direct cash transfer in the organization\u2019s history.So far, $67 million has been donated to the Red Cross for Fort McMurray wildfire relief.\u201cOver the past week, the people of Alberta have demonstrated incredible compassion, care and humanity,\u201d Sauve said. \xa0The federal government has pledged to match donations to the cause and the province will match donations from Albertans. \xa0The details on how\xa0that matching program will be sorted have not been worked out yet.\u201cOur officials are in conversations with Red Cross about matching funds,\u201d Notley said. \u201cMeanwhile the Red Cross has very generously offered to work with us on their electronic systems to help get our funds to those outside of Alberta.\u201dPremier Rachel Notley said pre-loaded debit cards will begin to be distributed Wednesday at designated  until May 20.The debit card locations will be open from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday and then from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. after that. More locations will be added in the coming days, the province said.After May 20, emergency financial assistance will move to Alberta Works offices.One family member can pick up debit cards for the entire family if they have documentation: a Red Cross registration number, photo ID, identification for a partner/spouse or dependents (if claiming for them), proof of residence in the community.Notley\xa0said there will be long lines and asked those who don\u2019t need the money immediately to hold off on getting their debit cards. If you don\u2019t have identification, statutory declarations will be accepted.\u201cOur aim is to get help to the evacuees who need it the most as quickly as possible,\u201d Notley said.\u201cIn order to allow for immediate distribution to people who are in most urgent need, we are asking evacuees who aren\u2019t in dire need of these funds to wait a few days before claiming them.Seniors, individuals with mobility issues, those with special needs and others who are in Alberta but unable to apply in person at a debit card location can contact 310-4455 to make alternative arrangements.\u201cLet me conclude by saying this emergency funding underscores the commitment every Albertan owes to each other,\u201d Notley said. \u201cIt is about Albertans helping Albertans. The fire has affected thousands\xa0of lives \u2013 Albertans who have contributed to this province.\u201dSauve said there has been an outpouring of support for this cause.\u201cThis is unprecedented in regards to individual giving,\u201d he said, referring to donations.\u201cWe know already the damage will be in the billions and it will take years to recover,\u201d Sauve added. \u201cBut we also know the needs are immediate.\u201dThe millions donated to the cause through the Canadian Red Cross by\xa0individuals and corporations has eclipsed public support for past national disasters such as the 2013 southern Alberta floods, Lac Megantic rail disaster and 2011 Slave Lake wildfire.As of Wednesday, the Red Cross had registered more than 80,000 people.\xa0All evacuees must register no matter where they are staying. You can or by calling 1-888-350-6070.Ontario will contribute $500,000 to the Red Cross to help wildfire relief and recovery efforts in Alberta. The province has also sent over 60 firefighters, three strike team leaders and 16 other staff to help on the ground.The federal Liberals have struck a cabinet committee involving nine different ministries to handle the aftermath of the Fort McMurray wildfire.Kent Hehr, the Calgary MP who serves as Veterans Affairs minister and associate minister of defence, will chair the committee, which includes ministers responsible for public safety, health, natural resources, infrastructure, labour and employment insurance, among others.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is to visit Fort McMurray on Friday and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley says she\u2019s already planning to urge the federal government to extend enhanced employment insurance benefits to Edmonton as a result of the wildfire fall-out.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will come as a huge surprise to the prime minister that we are well past the justification for new EI rules in the Edmonton area,\u201d Notley said. \u201cThe EI numbers came out and, under the current circumstances, there is a good case for it to be extended.\u201dEdmonton-area MP Rona Ambrose, the interim Conservative leader, offered rare praise for the government\u2019s cabinet committee move, calling it a very smart way to speed up decision-making.As of 6 p.m. MT Wednesday, the two fires in the Fort McMurray area that had joined together remained roughly 229,000 hectares in size. The wildfire is about 25 kilometres from the Saskatchewan boundary.There are 700 firefighters, 32\xa0helicopters, 13 air tankers and 83\xa0pieces of heavy equipment battling the wildfire. A steady stream of water bombers continued to fly over the roadblock south of Fort McMurray Tuesday. There was no heavy smoke, but crews were hitting hotspots.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a scene of devastation,\u201d Jeremy Hall said. He\u2019s a volunteer from Grande Prairie who\u2019s working with firefighters\xa0on the front lines.\u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart, that\u2019s for sure. A lot of people are going to be really upset to see it when they get back, there\u2019s no question. You can see just along the road here, it\u2019s a scene out of\xa0a movie. There\u2019s cars in the ditch and they\u2019re burnt and stuff. It\u2019s really tragic, but then you come around the next corner and there\u2019s a glimmer of hope because this whole entire subdivision might be in fantastic shape, not even touched.\u201cYou know this city is strong. They\u2019re going to rebuild,\u201d Hall said.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s Alberta Strong. Everyone has been going with that and I think it needs to stick with that.\u201dHe described having to pull down the walls of\xa0one\xa0home to stop the fire from spreading to many more.\u201cI could see a picture on the wall,\u201d Hall\xa0recalled, his voice breaking. \u201cThe little girl\u2019s name was Rebecca and the pictures on the wall\u2026 It was tough. It was really tough.\u201dShortly before 5 p.m. Wednesday, RCMP provided an update on their work in Fort McMurray.Inspector Kevin Kunetzki said the Fort McMurray RCMP detachment was open and operational and the Timberlea detachment would also be open soon. He said there are about 300 RCMP members in the community conducting patrols, checkpoints and other security.Kunetzki said RCMP saw\xa0100 instances of forced entry into homes \u2013 91 of the cases were found by initial police canvassing after the fire and nine were more recent. However, police cautioned against\xa0assuming criminal activity.\u201cSome of these cases of forced entry might be the result of neighbours looking to care for their neighbours and make sure they got out safely, if pets may have been in the residence.\u201dKunetzki said RCMP had responded to five reports of missing people and said in all cases, people have been found safe and sound.Mounties have also taken several guns into their possession since the community was evacuated.Kunetzki said two guns were seized as part of a break-and-enter investigation, one gun was found in a park and later connected to a May 7 break-and-enter investigation, and some firearms were turned over to RCMP to ensure they were safely kept.\u201cPolice are not forcefully entering homes to seize firearms,\u201d he stressed, adding there were three cases where guns were involved.Travel into Fort McMurray was still restricted to essential services only. There is still no public access into the city.\xa0As of Tuesday, industrial and commercial vehicles carrying supplies and equipment for oilsands operations were being allowed through Fort McMurray to worksites north of the city.RCMP have begun removing vehicles abandoned on the highway, including vehicles left at northern work camps when evacuees were flown out.Individuals forced to abandon their vehicles on Highway 63 during the evacuation should call Highway 63 Towing & Recovery at 1-877-671-2717 to confirm if your vehicle is at the yard.In order to pick up your vehicle, you must have your driver\u2019s licence and car key, registration and insurance (which may be in the glove box).Highway 63 Towing & Recovery is located in Wandering River, approximately 230 km north of Edmonton.\xa0Costs for towing and storage of abandoned vehicles will be covered by the province.The Beaver Lake Provincial Recreation Area campground near Lac La Biche is Alberta Parks\u2019 primary location for evacuees who are equipped to camp. No charge.\xa0Alberta Parks will also accept evacuees equipped to camp in other provincial campgrounds, also free of charge.In a meeting in Calgary Wednesday, ATCO Ltd. said it has a crew of 300 people in Fort McMurray working around the clock. They haven\u2019t turned the gas back on yet and won\u2019t until it is safe.COO Siegfried Kiefer said 75 per cent of the power is ready to go but bringing it back online will be staged.The company is also working with oilsands companies about recharging their sites. Kiefer expects the process to take weeks, but not as long as a month.ATCO also has 4,000 beds available and can provide longer-term space for evacuees if needed.The company will also be donating 10,000 meals to emergency responders.About 12,000 of the Fort McMurray evacuees are students, some of whom are graduating Grade 12 this year. On Wednesday, Education Minister David Eggen told\xa0Global News Morning Edmonton that\xa0no student will be penalized for missing days or weeks of school.If students choose not to return for the last month and a half of the school year, they will receive the mark they had to date as their final grade.\xa0The 900 Grade 12 students facing diploma exams have the option of writing them, or finishing the year with the grade they have right now.Although the options are in place, the province and school officials are encouraging students to enrol in their nearest school to restore a sense of routine and normalcy during a chaotic time. About 1,900 students have already done so.', u'Bell\u2019s appeal against sharing Internet infrastructure deniedOTTAWA \u2013 The federal cabinet is supporting a CRTC decision that forces Canada\u2019s big Internet providers to share their high-speed infrastructure with smaller carriers at a wholesale cost.Bell Canada had asked the Liberal government to overrule the regulator\u2019s decision, saying it would discourage innovation.But the minister responsible for the telecom industry, Navdeep Bains, said today in a statement that middle-class and low-income families need access to affordable, high-speed Internet.He said the wholesale broadband ruling helps enable retail competition in the market.Bell had argued that the regulation could slow innovation by forcing it to stop investing in technology.Bell\u2019s appeal followed a July 2015 decision by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which ordered Canada\u2019s telecom giants to provide other Internet providers with wholesale access to their fibre optic networks.Bains said the CRTC decision balances the industry\u2019s incentive to continue to invest and consumer choice.

But it\u2019s unlikely that their children or grandchildren will experience the same job tenure.The survey of more than 1,000 Americans 50 and older by the Associated Press- shows that 41 per cent of those employed workers have spent two decades with the same company, including 18 per cent who\u2019ve stayed at least 30 years.But it\u2019s a trend more common among the older baby boomers than younger ones, and traditional pensions appear to be one of the driving factors.Among those who have had at least 20 years with a single employer, the survey found that about half are excited about retirement, but a third are anxious about their post-work lives.David McQuinn, 61, is retiring Tuesday after 30 years with MiTek, a construction and engineering firm in suburban St. Louis. He says there were times he thought about leaving but he liked his co-workers and his senior position and also owned stock in the company.\u201cI started working young and I\u2019ve been a man in a hurry my whole life,\u201d he says, \u201cand now I\u2019m in a hurry to not be in a hurry.\u201dHis experience exemplifies a trait among boomers: more attachment to the company than the younger generations. But even among older Americans there\u2019s a gap in employment tenure: Half of those aged 65 and up but only a third of those age 50 to 64 have stayed with the same employer for at least two decades.The shift may be less about differences in attitude than changes in jobs \u2014 and benefits.About two-thirds of those who stayed with one employer for 20 or more years had a pension, according to the survey, compared with only a third of those who had never stayed that long with one employer.Those defined benefit pension plans are slowly disappearing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that only 18 per cent of private workers were covered by these plans in 2011, down from 35 per cent in the early 1990s. More common now are plans like 401(k)s, which are more portable from one employer to another.The agency has reported that a larger proportion of older workers than younger workers had more tenure on the job. For example it said, in January 2014, the average tenure with the current employer was 7.9 years for people 45 to 54, compared to 10.4 years for those 55 to 64.\u201cThink of all the choices people have today. I mean, who ever heard of a social-media analyst five years ago?\u201d says Joe Coughlin, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s AgeLab.Coughlin says higher churn in the labour market also means companies will have to work harder to hire and retain the workers they need, and this creates leverage.Christina Guerrero worked in the mid-1980s as a housekeeper at Austin\u2019s Brackenridge Hospital before applying for and getting a job as a clinical assistant.She kept that job for 17 years, before moving to a neighbouring children\u2019s hospital. Lifting children into hospital beds, she recalls, was easier on her back then moving adults.\u201cI thought about looking for other jobs, but almost any hospital these days would require me to go back to school to finish my GED, so that was a big reason for staying put,\u201d says Guerrero, now 61.According to the AP-NORC survey, younger baby boomers were much more likely to have gone back to school in the past five years: 30 per cent of those age 50-64, compared to 19 per cent of those 65 and older.Most went for additional training because their employer required it or they wanted to learn something new or fun. Only 17 per cent said they received training to start a new career.Joe Abraham, 65, says he\u2019s sure he \u201cdodged a few bullets along the way\u201d during his 36-year career as an attorney at Ford Motor Co.Now retired, he says the raises and benefits he got from Ford were not worth giving up for something else. Plus, he just liked his colleagues._________\xa0', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Red Cross has raised $60 million and countingCALGARY \u2013 The large amount of money donated to the Red Cross to help Fort McMurray wildfire evacuees is eclipsing public support for past Canadian disasters.The Canadian Red Cross has already collected $60 million from individuals and corporations. That number doesn\u2019t include additional money coming from Ottawa and the Alberta government, which have both promised to match donations made by individuals.\u201cI don\u2019t have a breakdown on what the individual number is yet, but we\u2019ve had very good corporate support,\u201d Red Cross spokeswoman Shelly Makrugin said Tuesday.She said every disaster is different, \u201cso we don\u2019t compare disasters per se.\u201dBut at $60 million and counting, donations have already surpassed the $43.3 million Canadians gave during the catastrophic 2013 southern Alberta floods. More than 100,000 people in several communities, including Calgary and High River, were forced from their homes.Red Cross donations after the 2013 Lac Megantic rail disaster that killed 47 people and destroyed half the community\u2019s downtown totalled $14.8 million.The 2011 wildfire that destroyed one-third of Slave Lake, Alta., five years ago brought in $5.5 million.Makrugin said the Red Cross is in \u201cemergency mode\u201d in the Fort McMurray area. Cash is being used to make sure those affected get basics such as cots, blankets and hygiene kits.The agency provides help on top of what insurance companies and government programs offer.\u201cThe phase right now is emergency response, which is covering people\u2019s basic needs, and it will also be used for the recovery and the rebuilding phases as well,\u201d she said.The Red Cross was involved for four years after the Slave Lake fire, which destroyed 400 buildings.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire\u2019s impact measured by the numbersCALGARY \u2013 Here\u2019s a\xa0by-the-numbers look at the , and its impact on the oilsands industry.

Estimated reduction in daily revenue for energy companies from decline in production. The reduction in natural gas demand from shuttered oilsands operations.(Sources: AltaCorp Capital, FirstEnergy Capital)', u'First oilsands mine shut by Fort McMurray wildfire reopensCALGARY \u2013 The first oilsands mine shut down by wildfires in the Fort McMurray region a week ago has been restarted and optimism is building that many of the largest operations will be producing again in a little as a few days.Shell Canada said Tuesday morning that it had resumed production at its Albian Sands mining operations about 95 kilometres north of Fort McMurray after a seven-day closure.The operations, which include the Muskeg River and Jackpine oilsands mines, have the capacity to produce 255,000 barrels of oil a day, but Shell would say only that they were initially operating at a reduced rate.Meanwhile, in a joint news conference in Edmonton with Premier Rachel Notley on Tuesday afternoon, Suncor Energy Inc. (TSX:SU) CEO Steve Williams said some oilsands operations north of the city could be up and running in a few days, while some south and east of the city where a fire still rages will take longer.Williams said that north of Fort McMurray operations were affected by smoke but not fire.\u201cAnd there, you\u2019re thinking of days or maybe a week or so but not talking longer periods,\u201d he said.\u201cSouth, where there have been a few more direct impacts from the fire, we have to go in and evaluate and then put the plans in place.\u201dHe said pipelines appear to be intact but some of the electrical power infrastructure has been affected.Notley said it appears there may be some damage to the Nexen Long Lake facility owned by China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd. but it\u2019s unclear how much.Shell\u2019s oilsands mines were closed to allow employees to tend to their families and to free up Shell\u2019s work camp to accommodate some of the 80,000 people evacuated from Fort McMurray. Shell said the decision to restart was made because of improvements in air quality and weather and because the fire now is moving way from the site.\u201cSafe restart is important to our company and staff to allow us to contribute to the recovery efforts of the Fort McMurray area,\u201d Zoe Yujnovich, Shell executive vice-president for oilsands, said in a statement.Shell said it would fly staff in and out of the site to ramp up production over the coming days and weeks.Analyst Nick Lupick of AltaCorp Capital estimated Tuesday that the shutdown of Imperial Oil Ltd.\u2019s (TSX:IMO) Kearl oilsands mining project on Monday had increased the amount of production offline in the oilsands to just over 1.1 million barrels a day. Kearl was producing about 200,000 barrels a day of bitumen.Four of the five oilsands mining operations in the region were shut down due to the fire. The only one that didn\u2019t close was the Horizon mine operated by Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (TSX:CNQ).In a report Tuesday, commodities analyst Martin King of First Energy Capital said a decline in demand drove average Alberta gas prices down to 33 cents per thousand cubic feet on Monday, the lowest daily average price he could recall in at least 30 years.Oilsands operations use a tremendous amount of natural gas to produce and process the bitumen and to provide power from gas-fired co-generation plants on site.\u201cThey were already looking at weak prices from high storage in Alberta \u2014 high storage everywhere, really \u2014 and this is just, it\u2019s not even the icing on the cake, it\u2019s the icing on the icing on the cake in terms of bad prices,\u201d King said in an interview.The oilsands shutdowns have reduced demand for natural gas in Alberta by 700 million to 900 million cubic feet a day, King estimated. That\u2019s about 25 per cent of total gas demand in the province. He said the oilsands industry normally burns about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas.Prices are expected to improve as oilsands projects come back online but gas producers will likely remain under pressure, King said.Shell said it sheltered more than 2,000 evacuees between last Tuesday and Saturday but all have since left. It said more than 8,000 individuals were evacuated from its airstrip on more than 80 flights during the same period.', u'Fundraising for Fort McMurray: Calgary eventsLocal businesses, groups and individuals all over the city are responding in a variety of ways to the  that have been wreaking havoc in Fort McMurray and northern Alberta.Canadians have already and\xa0Calgarians can continue to show their support\xa0while\xa0enjoying a day (or night) on the town. Here\u2019s a look at just a few\xa0of the many fundraising events taking place over the coming days and weeks.The Locked Room, an interactive escape room attraction, will be opening early on Tuesday, May 10 and donating all proceeds from the door as well as matching all donations themselves. Get there at 6 p.m.On May 11, The Concorde Group is\xa0hosting a family-friendly fundraiser at the National on 10th beginning at 4 p.m. There will be a raffle, and a silent auction to drum up some funds to support victims of the wildfire. $10 at the door.If you\u2019re in the Chestermere area, head to the recreation centre at 201 W Chestermere Dr on Friday, May 13 for a barbecue and silent auction, hosted by the Chestermere Langdon Oilmen\u2019s Association. This family friendly event will feature live entertainment at a cost of $10 per person or $25 for a family.\xa0All Calgary\u2019s Best Pubs\u2019 locations will be offering $1\xa0from every pint of Gas Lamp beer sold to the Red Cross on Saturday, May 14.Proving that fundraisers are not limited to bars and restaurants, Yoga Santosha in southwest Calgary is offering a special fundraising class on Saturday, May 14 from 5:45 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. They will be charging a $10 minimum donation for the class and will be supporting yoga practitioners who may have been displaced by collecting yoga mats and clothes.Broken City is putting on a two-day concert\xa0featuring over 20 bands, beginning Tuesday, May 17. They are donating 10 per cent of all bar sales and a percentage of all Big Rock beer sold to the relief effort.On May 15 from 12 p.m.\xa0until 5 p.m., there will be\xa0a car wash and bake sale at the Picton Fire Hall. All the money raised at this event will be donated to the Whalen and Yuill families, both of which were living in two of the neighbourhoods in Fort McMurray that experienced some of the worst destruction.That same day, the Alberta Fire Relief Bottle Drive takes place at 3370 Spruce Drive S.W. from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Bring all the empties you can scrounge up and they will be put to good use.Head down to Atlantic Trap and Gill on Thursday, May 19 for a night of local live music, door prizes and a silent auction. $10 at the door.Beginning May 6 and running until June 26, Stage West will be donating $10 from every regular ticket sold for the remainder of the run of  to the Red Cross.', u'Nova Scotia confident in renewable energy target with or without Muskrat FallsNova Scotia is making plans to ensure it can meet its renewable energy targets in 2020 no matter what happens to the $9.2 billion  hydroelectric project in Labrador, says the province\u2019s energy minister.Nova Scotia has set a goal of obtaining 40 per cent of its electricity from green sources by 2020 \u2013 with Muskrat Falls expected to provide slightly less than 10 per cent of the province\u2019s overall needs once it\u2019s online.But a consultant\u2019s report submitted at a Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board rate hearing warns the renewable target could be threatened if Muskrat Falls is delayed or cancelled.Energy Minister\xa0Michel Samson\xa0said Tuesday that his department is looking at contingency plans to cover the difference in the event of major delays, while noting the renewable goal is still four years away.He said the province is continuing to invest in technologies such as power storage and tidal power in an attempt to increase the amount of renewable energy available.\u201cWe are constantly looking at new technologies, investing with our federal partners and looking at ways that we can have a smaller carbon footprint in our province,\u201d he said.The report by Drazen Consulting Group says the province and Nova Scotia Power should prepare alternate plans should electricity not flow from the project as expected.\u201cThe problem would be that it may not meet the Renewable Energy Standard. NSPI and the government should start contemplating their range of responses and NSPI should inform the board and customers of the effects of backup plans.\u201dDrazen\u2019s report is part of the evidence before the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board, which is examining a request by Nova Scotia Power to raise rates by 4.5 per cent over the next three years to cover fuel costs.Catherine Abreu, energy coordinator at the Halifax-based Ecology Action Centre, also believes the province should be planning ahead.Abreu said without Muskrat Falls, meeting the renewable target would be a challenge as would building the transmission system that was meant to accommodate power generated by the project and from other green sources.She said the time is ideal to approach Ottawa about infrastructure funding for such things as smart grid and power storage technologies.The project, a joint venture between Newfoundland Crown corporation Nalcor and Nova Scotia Power\u2019s parent company Emera (TSX:EMA) will carry power through the island of Newfoundland and on to Nova Scotia through subsea cables and overland transmission lines.Emera\u2019s portion, the $1.6 billion Maritime Link, will come in on budget and on time in late 2017, company CEO Chris Huskilson said in a conference call on Tuesday.\u201cAs it relates to the timing of the generation \u2026 Nalcor hasn\u2019t been clear about what they believe the timing of the project is at this point,\u201d said Huskilson. \u201cI think what we currently know at this point is that it is somewhat late and so we are planning around that.\u201dPower that was expected to flow by 2017 is now delayed until sometime in 2018 with costs currently about 10 per cent over budget from Nalcor\u2019s end.The government of Newfoundland and Labrador has said it expects a new schedule and cost estimates for the project by the end of this month.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Will parts of city stay abandoned? Depends on oil pricesAbout\xa02,400 buildings were\xa0\xa0in Fort McMurray last week by devastating wildfires, officials said Monday.Will all of them be rebuilt, or will the northern Alberta city stay partly in ruins for years? It depends on oil prices, a University of Alberta urban planning professor explains.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that that would happen,\u201d Leith Deacon says. \u201cOf course, if oil stayed at $20 a barrel, and it\u2019s not financially feasible, then there would be trouble.\u201dAs Global News reporter Brian Hill last week, Fort McMurray homeowners who find themselves with badly damaged or destroyed houses face a stressful decision about what to do with their insurance claims.Typically, home insurance policies cover either the cost of a new house in the same location or compensation for the value of the house as it existed.With job losses in the oil patch that devastated Alberta\u2019s economy even before the fires, some families whose Fort McMurray homes are smoking ruins may cash the insurance cheque and move on. (A \xa0in April said that significant numbers of people were migrating from Alberta to B.C. in search of work.)Building a new house typically results in a larger payout, all other things being equal. But a new house in an isolated city\xa0with spiking unemployment may not be useful to a resident who was thinking of moving in search of work in any case. And if you were thinking of leaving anyway, a new house in Fort McMurray is only going to be worth what somebody is willing to pay for it.Real estate prices in Fort McMurray have fallen about 20 per cent over the last year, along with oil prices. Homeowners who bought at the top of the local market and had their homes incinerated\xa0at the bottom might have little or nothing left after paying off the bank, if they chose to walk away.\u201cA lot of these people, probably, have mortgages on their properties \u2014 it\u2019s not as simple as just cutting your ties,\u201d Deacon says. \u201cA lot of people who moved there probably paid very high values for the lots and the house.\u201dIt\u2019s a strong incentive to stay and rebuild \u2014 assuming there\u2019s a job.However, capital spending on oil and gas in Alberta this year is expected to be less than half of what it was in 2014,\xa0a released by Statistics Canada today reported.On the other hand, a rebuilding effort may stimulate an otherwise weak local economy.\u201cI understand that the price of oil currently is low, but unless something happens tomorrow that we suddenly don\u2019t need petroleum products, I think there\u2019s a future for Fort McMurray.\u201d\u201cIt might not rebuild as fast as it would have five years ago, when oil was at $100 a barrel, but I do think that what has happened will give them the opportunity to take a bit of a step back to figure out what is the best way to rebuild, and how you deal with the potential for future fires and the potential for future hard times.\u201dAs the wildfire situation in Fort McMurray, Alta., appeared to stabilize Sunday, insurance companies across Canada have already begun deploying mobile response units and are flying in personnel to the province from across the country to prepare to assess the damage.', u'Syria tries to manage currency\u2019s decline as it hits new lowBEIRUT \u2013 Syria\u2019s Central Bank ordered money changers to exchange currency at an unprecedented 620 Syrian pounds to the dollar and announced it would reevaluate the rate on a daily basis, in a move that economists say amounts to jettisoning the fixed exchange rate that was once the bedrock of the Syrian economy.The new rate means the Syrian pound is now worth one-thirteenth of its pre-war value on legal markets, though economists reported it was trading at that rate on the black market two days ago. The currency traded at 47 pounds, also commonly known as lira, to the dollar before anti-government protests in 2011 drew a crackdown that sparked the current civil war.Central Bank authorities will adjust the rate without forewarning with the aim to manage the currency\u2019s \u201cgradual decline,\u201d Syrian state media reported.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe new regime, which Johns Hopkins economist Steve Henke described as a \u201cmanaged flexible rate,\u201d signals the end of the currency peg regimen that underpinned Syria\u2019s managed socialist economy that brought decades of steady growth.\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the government finances,\u201d said Henke about the Central Bank decision. The government has little choice but to print more money \u2014 effectively exhausting the currency\u2019s worth \u2014 to pay for its expenditures at a time when it is thought to be out of foreign currency reserves.An April report by the World Bank estimated Syria\u2019s reserves at just $700 million, down $18 billion from before the war \u2014 though it acknowledged it was not an official figure \u2014 the effect of five years of crippling western sanctions and catastrophic war.Inflation, already at 95%, according to Henke\u2019s Troubled Currencies research initiative, could soar to 200-300 per cent, or levels last seen in 2013.\u201cThey have experienced that in Syria, although they did get that under control,\u201d he said.American University of Beirut economist Simon Neaime said the Tuesday Central Bank announcement pointed to a \u201ccurrency crisis.\u201d\u201cIt means they ran out of (foreign currency) reserves,\u201d said Neaime. \u201cThey are floating the currency.\u201dHe warned that dramatic inflation could follow. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop at 620. You might wake up tomorrow and it\u2019s 1,000. After tomorrow, 2,000 Syrian lira per dollar. There is no ceiling as to where it\u2019s going to stop.\u201dThe Syrian economy has been in free fall since 2012 and tax revenues have virtually collapsed, according to the World Bank. The government\u2019s territorial losses in oil-rich areas have added to its woes.\u201cThey used to export a lot of oil, but Daesh has being doing it on their behalf,\u201d said Neaime, referring to the militant Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.The currency\u2019s value has eroded since Russia announced it was scaling back its involvement in the war on the side of the government, in March, when it traded on the black market at roughly 440 pounds to the dollar.', u'Pierre Poilievre has learned to love the PBOPierre Poilievre held a press conference this morning to tout the work of the  (PBO), specifically praising a report on the fiscal impacts of not reducing taxes for small businesses.It was a moment none in Ottawa could have seen coming a year ago.The previous Conservative government, Poilievre included, slammed the PBO on numerous occasions during its time in power.The latest incident occurred just over a year ago, on March 17, 2015. On that occasion, the PBO released a report on income splitting which showed just two million households would benefit from the scheme and middle to middle-high income households would receive the greatest advantage.Poilievre\u2019s response was a statement dismissing the report, saying in part: \u201cThe high-tax parties think bureaucrats should decide how Canadians\u2019 hard-earned money is spent but our Government believes in keeping more money in the pockets of Canadian families.\u201dHowever, Poilievre recently requested the PBO look into the small business tax cut that didn\u2019t happen this year, and today was quite willing to endorse the PBO\u2019s findings.Naturally, a reporter asked about the change of heart.Here is a transcript of the\xa0exchange (you can watch the full video\xa0above).Reporter: Can you explain why when you were in power the PBO was a pariah and now his word is gospel?\xa0 Can you just explain that?Poilievre: That\u2019s an outrageous suggestion (laughs). I didn\u2019t comment on its truthfulness. I just said it was outrageous. No, joking aside, I think that government officials have access to departmental resources and Opposition members, Members of Parliament tend to rely more heavily on the Parliamentary Budget Officer.\xa0I\u2019m very glad we created this office especially over the last eight months I\u2019ve come to appreciate more and more the PBO.\xa0 I expect that appreciation will grow further as the years go on.Reporter: Do you regret thumping on [the PBO] for numerous years?Poilievre: I think it\u2019s always good to have a healthy tension between parliamentary budget offices and the Finance Department because it allows for as much openness as possible in the finances of the nation and we look forward to working with the PBO and with Finance Canada for that matter.', u'Big 5 Canadian banks to offer Apple Pay as mobile payments rise in Canada will finally be available to more Canadian consumers, as the Big Five banks gear up to launch the service to cardholders.Starting Tuesday, debit and major credit cards issued by the  (RBC) and  (CIBC) will support the mobile payment technology that allows iPhone users to pay for things using their smartphone or Apple Watch.Apple Pay will also be available to Canadian Tire Bank and ATB Financial cardholders this week. Those who bank with BMO Financial will also be able to use Apple Pay in the coming weeks.CIBC and RBC customers will be able to use Apple Pay with their MasterCard, Visa and American Express credit cards, as well as their debit cards; however, Canadian Tire Financial will only support its credit card.\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Apple to bring a new way to pay that eliminates something many of us dislike: carrying a bulky physical wallet,\u201d said Jason Davies, Vice President of Digital Payments for MasterCard Canada.\xa0\u201cApple Pay allows consumers to pay with their iPhone \u2013 an item most of us wouldn\u2019t think to leave home without.\u201dAccording to a spokesperson with TD, Apple Pay will be available to its customers in \u201cthe coming weeks.\u201d\u201cWe have the most debit and credit card customers in Canada, and with the offer of yet another new mobile payment option, we\u2019re building on our leadership position in digital payments,\u201d said Teri Currie, group head of Canadian personal banking at TD Bank Group. (BMO) and the  (Scotiabank) will also roll out support for Apple Pay in the coming months.The move marks a significant step for Canada\u2019s adoption of mobile payments.Canadians have been waiting a long time for Apple Pay. The tech giant first launched the service in the U.S. in October 2014, but Canadians weren\u2019t able to use it until November 2015 \u2013 Canadian banks \u2013 including CIBC, Scotiabank and RBC \u2013 have been busy trying to promote their own mobile payments apps.But Canada is in a good position to be a world leader in mobile payments. According to a study conducted by market and consumer information firm GfK in February, Canadians consumers were more inclined to reach for their smartphones and credit cards to pay for things, instead of relying on cash.Ensuring Interac \u2013 Canada\u2019s domestic debit network \u2013 also works with Apple Pay is a big move for the platform. Without it, the service would have been limited to the credit cards.According to Interac, Canadians are among the highest users of debit in the world, using Interac an average of 16 million times daily. you must first input your debit or credit card information into your\xa0iPhone using the \u201cWallet\u201d app.Your bank or financial institution will create and transmit a unique device code, which is stored on a secure chip inside your phone. Your actual card number is not stored on the device \u2013 one of the key security features of Apple Pay, but we will get to that later.When you go to make a purchase, you will use the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on your device to authorize your purchase at a payment terminal with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology \u2013 also known as the \u201ctap to pay\u201d machine.\xa0A transaction code is then generated and sent to the financial institution, along with that unique device code, to process the transaction.Aside from a debit or credit card from participating banks, you will also need an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus running the latest iOS software. Older devices won\u2019t work, even with the latest update.Although security measures are never foolproof, Apple\u2019s system does include many robust security features.One of the biggest things to note is that unique device code that is created when you input your card information. Merchants get that instead of your real card number. A\xa0verification code is also created for each transaction, based in part on unique keys on the phone.Even if hackers get that unique device code, , so fraudulent transactions would be declined.Apple also maintains it knows nothing about your transactions, which are handled directly by the credit card processors.If you lose your phone, your credit card provider could cancel that unique device code, which means you wouldn\u2019t need to replace the entire card.', u'Panama Papers database, including thousands of Canadian connections, now onlineFRANKFURT \u2013 A group of investigative journalists on Monday published the names of thousands of offshore companies at the heart of a massive trove of data on the finances of the rich and powerful that has become known as the .The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) made data on 200,000 entities available on its website at 2:00 p.m. ET Monday.They contain basic corporate information about companies, trusts and foundations set up in 21 jurisdictions including Hong Kong and the U.S. state of Nevada. The data was obtained from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which said it was hacked.Users can search the data and see the networks involving the offshore companies, including, where available, Mossack Fonseca\u2019s internal records of the true owners.Information and documents on bank accounts, phone numbers and emails have been removed from the database.You can search for people and entities .The consortium estimates there are 1,352 corporate \u201cofficers\u201d linked to Canada in the documents. We don\u2019t know their nationalities, and these are a combination of corporations and individuals. There are also 912 offshore entities, 242 \u201cintermediaries\u201d and 1,312 addresses linked to Canada.Please note, this data is compiled by the ICIJ and has not been independently verified by Global News. There are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts and there\u2019s no indication anyone in this database broke the law. Also note, there are sometimes multiple companies or individuals with the same name, and those listed here should be verified independently.Mossack Fonseca said last week it had sent a cease and desist letter to the ICIJ urging the organization not to publish the database, \u201ctaking into consideration that it is based on the theft of confidential information.\u201dThe ICIJ said it was putting the information online \u201cin the public interest\u201d as \u201ca careful release of basic corporate information\u201d as it builds on an earlier database of offshore entities.Setting up an offshore company is not by itself illegal or evidence of illegal conduct, and Mossack Fonseca said it observed rules requiring it to identify its clients.The ICIJ prefaced the data dump by noting that the appearance of particular persons and companies on the list doesn\u2019t imply wrongdoing.But anti-poverty campaigners say shell companies can be used by the wealthy and powerful to shield money from taxation, or to launder the gains from bribery, embezzlement and other forms of corruption. The Group of 20 most powerful economies has agreed that individual governments should make sure authorities can tell who really owns legally registered companies, but implementation in national law has lagged.The data cache, first leaked to Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily, showed offshore holdings of 12 current and former world leaders.

The ICIJ reported that associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin moved some $2 billion through such companies. Putin\u2019s spokesman dismissed the report.The ICIJ said Monday that Mossack Fonseca had files on dozens of Americans who have faced accusations of civil or criminal financial misconduct. That was based on reporting credited to consortium partners McClatchy Newspapers, the Portland Business Journal and Fusion InvestigatesIts website reported that people who had set up offshore companies included people with publicly available records of their legal troubles. One was a financier sentenced in 2002 to prison for fraud. The firm also set up a company for six Americans later sued for running a Ponzi scheme, a type of financial fraud in which new money is used to pay off earlier investors until the scheme collapses.The report said he leaked records \u201csuggest that Mossack Fonseca\u2019s high-volume business model made it difficult for it to keep track of its clients\u2019 backgrounds and activities.\u201d The firm set up more than 100,000 offshore entities, such as trusts and shell companies, between 2005 and 2015, the report said.\u201cMossack Fonseca\u2019s working relationships with dozens of Americans tied to financial misconduct raises questions about how well the firm keeps its commitment to following international standards for preventing money laundering and keeping offshore companies out of the hands of criminal elements,\u201d the ICIJ report said.', u'Could the Fort McMurray fire affect gas prices across Canada?Gas prices across Canada are expected to rise due to the , but when and by how much they will increase is still undetermined.According to website , prices for regular fuel varied Monday from a low of 88.9 cents per litre in Edmonton to a high of $1.19 in Vancouver. The average price in Calgary was 92.9 cents, while Toronto sat at $1.04 per litre.With many  in the wake of the fire, production is down more than a million barrels per day in Alberta., senior petroleum analyst at , told Global News there is a \u201ccushion in place\u201d and it\u2019s too early to tell how the fire will affect gas prices.The worst case scenario, according to McTeague, would not just be an increase in gas prices, but a movement towards rationing of gas.\u201cThat\u2019s way down the road and worst case scenario,\u201d he assured. \u201cI\u2019m not into the business of trying to sensationalize or become alarmist and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201dThe cost of a barrel of oil was up to just over CDN$57 Monday, which McTeague pointed out is about the same it was trading at a week ago.\u201cWe have to get a better and clear understanding of the level of production and how long it will be disrupted before it will have any meaningful impact on driving prices up,\u201d he said.In its latest report in February, the National Energy Board said there had been an average of 2.5 million barrels per day produced from the oilsands so far in 2016.Shell Canada closed its Albian mine operations north of Fort McMurray on May 3, taking about 250,000 bpd out of production.Michael Dunn, an oilsands analyst for Calgary investment firm FirstEnergy Capital, said Shell\u2019s refinery near Edmonton is specifically designed to use feedstock from its mine but that supply has been cut off by a pipeline outage.He said if Shell\u2019s refinery runs out of stored bitumen and is forced to close, it will result in a much tighter gasoline supply in Western Canada. Higher prices for oilsands crude will squeeze profit margins at rival refineries and cause them to raise prices for consumers.Overnight Wednesday, Suncor Energy shut down its upgrader just north of Fort McMurray, taking about 300,000 bpd of synthetic crude out of the market, and ConocoPhillips Canada closed its Surmont operations, which had been producing about 53,000 bpd.On a conference call May 5, president Steve Laut of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. said he believes the industry will recover quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s a very resilient and I would say innovative service and supply industry here in Alberta and in Fort McMurray,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect we will recover fairly quickly but it\u2019s too early to say how much damage has actually been done to equipment and operations in the town of Fort McMurray.\u201dHe warned that if the wildfire cuts off the supply of external power to Canadian Natural\u2019s Horizon oilsands mine and upgrader, output would be choked back to 70,000 bpd from about 130,000 bpd. Electricity generated on site would allow the facility to continue to produce on a limited basis.Horizon, which is 70 kilometres north of Fort McMurray, has had only minor setbacks related to the fire, mainly from pipeline outages.Canada is the leading exporter of crude oil and natural gas to the United States, according to figures from the Energy Information Administration. Canada sends about 100 million barrels of crude and 240 billion cubic feet of natural gas per month to the U.S.\u201cIt definitely is helping to boost the prices, although (the increase) is not that high considering the amount of crude that is being threatened,\u201d said Jeff Mower of S&P Global Platts, which tracks the energy industry. He attributed the restrained market reaction to high inventories of crude in the U.S., especially in the Midwest, where much of the Canadian crude goes for refining.Some grades of Canadian crude normally trade at premiums to benchmark U.S. oil while others usually trade at a discount, but all were trading higher Thursday and Friday than earlier in the week, according to Platts.Key pipelines were closed Thursday, although a major one reopened Friday morning, according to analysts for Genscape, which monitors the pipelines.Much of the oil from the oilsands is refined in the United States. The impact on the U.S. oil market will depend on how long the interruption lasts.If facilities are not damaged, \u201cthen the production cuts are only as long-lasting as the fires,\u201d said Dylan White, an oil storage analyst with Genscape. \u201cOnce the fires are subdued workers can come back to the production sites.\u201dRitterbusch and Associates, which advises oil traders, said that such a short-term outage shouldn\u2019t have much effect on oil prices because of a huge surplus of U.S. crude supplies.', u'Winner of $429M U.S. Powerball jackpot yet to come forwardTRENTON, N.J. \u2013 The winner of the  has yet to come forward to claim the prize, as the New Jersey store that sold the winning ticket celebrates.Only one ticket matched all six Powerball numbers in Saturday night\u2019s drawing. The winning numbers were 5-25-26-44-66 and the Powerball number was 9. Lottery officials in New Jersey said Sunday the ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven in the state capital of Trenton. It was purchased as a cash ticket and is valued at $284 million. The vendor that sold the ticket also gets a prize, but the amount has not yet been announced.\u201cCongratulations to 7-Eleven for selling this winning ticket and to the fortunate ticketholder who purchased the ticket,\u201d said Carole Hedinger, New Jersey Lottery executive director. \u201cWe look forward to meeting the winner of this record-setting jackpot.\u201dThe jackpot is the sixth-largest in Powerball jackpot history, and the largest single jackpot winning ticket sold in New Jersey.Marcelo Chilel said that when he heard the ticket was sold in Mercer County, he thought it would be great if it was sold at the store where he works. And when he found out that was the case, he says he felt very happy for the customer.The jackpot Saturday was the largest since a record $1.6 billion payout in January. That jackpot was shared by three winning tickets.Only one winning ticket will claim Saturday night\u2019s prize, though it was not immediately known if that ticket was held by one person or multiple people.This isn\u2019t the first time Powerball luck has struck in New Jersey. In 2013, a sole ticket claimed a $383 million Powerball jackpot.Seven tickets from Saturday night\u2019s drawing matched five numbers and claimed $1 million, including three in New York, two in Illinois and one apiece in California and Virginia.Powerball is played in 44 states plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.The odds of winning are one in 292.2 million.The New Jersey Lottery said it will hold a press conference on Monday morning at the 7-Eleven to discuss the details of the winning ticket.___', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Insurance companies begin preparing for fire claimsAs the wildfire situation in Fort McMurray, Alta appeared to stabilize Sunday, insurance companies across Canada have already begun deploying mobile response units and flying in personnel to the province from across the country to prepare to assess the damage.Most companies have natural disaster and crisis units that were deployed to emergency centres soon after 80,000 people were given the order to leave their homes last Wednesday.Some 16 insurance companies have established temporary claims offices at the Northlands evacuation centre in Edmonton, and 10\xa0have set up further north in Lac la Biche, said Bill Adams, the vice-president for the western and pacific region for the Insurance Bureau of Canada.Staff in the centres have been opening claims files and issuing emergency cheques for evacuees, he said.\u201cSome didn\u2019t have identification except what\u2019s in their vehicles. They don\u2019t have access to their bank accounts, they have to reapply for their basic information,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for Intact Insurance said the company has a catastrophe team that works year-round. It set up temporary claims centres \u201cwithin hours\u201d of the evacuation order.Rosa Nelson said the company has opened offices in Edmonton, Lac la Biche and Calgary where agents are beginning the claims process and issuing $5,000 emergency cheques.Craig Richardson, the vice president of claims operations for TD Insurance, says the company has sent about 30 people to work at shelters with evacuees,. It also mobilized 500 people internally across the country to help with anything from answering phones to flying out and assessing fire damage.\u201cI think speed matters a lot, and when you have these type of devastating and traumatic events customers need to understand we\u2019re there to stand with them when they need us the most,\u201d he said.The company has also dispatched its two \u201cmobile response units,\u201d which are RVs customized to serve as satellite claims offices.Adams says both the companies and private citizens are waiting for the government to let them enter the Fort McMurray area.At that point, he expects hundreds of insurance adjusters to converge on Fort McMurray, as companies send teams with trucks and trailers of equipment to open field offices and begin processing claims.The damage can range from the total loss of a residence to the cost of cleaning smoky carpets to replacing food in a refrigerator.And although almost all home insurance covers fire damage, the size of the payout will be calculated based on factors including the type of damage, value of goods in the house and the type of policy purchased.One RCMP officer said Saturday that officers were seeing significant signs of water and smoke damage during their checks of houses in the city.Adams said the insurance industry was considering using satellite and drone technology to help survey and map damaged areas to make the claims process go more quickly, although he couldn\u2019t estimate how long it would take.He said that after the fires in Slave Lake, Alta in 2011, people who lost their homes had to wait anywhere from eight months to over two years for them to be rebuilt.Many companies say they\u2019ve had ample opportunity to practice their disaster response in recent years, especially in Alberta.Between the Slave Lake fires and massive flooding in parts of southern Alberta in 2013, the province already accounts for almost 60 per cent of all insurance claims resulting from severe weather events, Adams said. That\u2019s a number that\u2019s likely to rise as the Fort McMurray claims start to come in.Nelson said her company has seen \u201cexceedingly more\u201d natural disasters over the last ten years than ever before.', u'Income immobility: Fewer Canadians are moving up \u2013 or down \u2013 the income ladderCanadians have less income mobility than they\u2019ve had in decades as fewer people move up the income ladder \u2014 and even fewer move down.A \xa0of decades of income trends found that relative income mobility \u2014 how you\u2019re doing compared to everyone else \u2014 is shrinking, and is well below what it was in the 1980s and 1990s.: Between 1985 and 1990, three-quarters of Canadians changed deciles; between 2007 and 2012, only two-thirds did.When people do move up or down the income ladder, .Fewer\xa0are seeing real income growth, and the growth they\u2019re seeing is at its lowest rate\xa0since 1997.The lowest-earning Canadians are seeing their rate of income growth drop to its lowest point since 1995.Study author Xuelin Zhang compares it to running a marathon: Absolute mobility is your running time. Relative mobility is where you place.Absolute mobility is steady: You\u2019re still running that race a bit faster every five years.But Canadians\u2019\xa0ability to overtake other runners, to change where they\xa0fall in that marathon, \u201cthat\u2019s become weaker over time,\u201d Zhang\xa0said.The highest-earning people in Canada stay in that richest tranche; the lowest-earning people stay in the bottom bracket.As anyone discussing\xa0their \u201cpersonal best\u201d race time will tell you, absolute mobility is important: If you earn enough to pay for your needs, you should be fine.But income immobility\xa0means Canadians have a harder time overcoming income inequality.\u201cWhen you have a reasonable level of income mobility \u2026 inequality could be reduced,\u201d Zhang said.Zhang\u2019s data series ends with 2012 tax filings. But from what he\u2019s seen the trend hasn\u2019t changed.Blame globalization. And technology. And a labour economy shifting faster than any institution can\xa0adapt.And not having much formal education has become much more of a barrier.\u201cThe labour market is a lot harder on those who aren\u2019t completely tooled up,\u201d Corak said.Income strata are calcifying elsewhere: It\u2019s more extreme in the U.S.; less so in Germany.The more people earning different amounts live in different worlds, and the harder it becomes to travel between those worlds, the more frustrated people can become, Corak said.One example is disaffection-fuelled Republican candidate , he said.\u201cThat movie is playing out in the United States.\u201dThere\u2019s no easy way to make it easier for people to move between income rungs, Corak says. But governments can\xa0at least\xa0buttress the lower end of the ladder.Making it easier to re-train or update skills would help. Initiatives like the  program, he argues, \u201ccut the wrong way.\u201d They can depress wages\xa0and employment standards, paying\xa0low amounts to people with limited recourse,\xa0on the assumption they aren\u2019t sticking around.\u201cBut the other thing you have\xa0to do is accept that the nature of work has changed tremendously. And you really can\u2019t pour too much sand into the gears of globalization and computerization,\u201d Corak said.Canada\u2019s  program, which is applied very disparately\xa0depending where in Canada you live, is ripe for reform, Corak said.Last fall, 93 per cent of unemployed Newfoundlanders were on EI, compared to 35 per cent in B.C. and 29 per cent in Ontario. has heightened .One of the most effective ways to preserve wealth inequality is to pass it on to your kids.\u201cAs this generation retires, some of them are going to be really well-to-do and pass a good deal of resources on to their children. Others aren\u2019t going to have that option,\u201d Corak said.\u201cSo you have to sort of think about fairness in the tax transfer\xa0system, particularly around intergenerational transfers.\u201d', u'Want to buy a house in Canada? It\u2019ll cost you 400 weeks of workMillennials looking to get into Canada\u2019s hot housing market don\u2019t just have to pay more than their grandparents did, they\u2019re having to work twice as long too.New research from the  in Ottawa on Thursday measured prices in terms of how many weeks of work are required to pay for it.Marc Lavoie, a researcher with Broadbent Institute, found it took just over 200 weeks of work to buy the average Canadian home in 1970. That\u2019s shot up to more than 400 weeks\u2019 pay in 2015.He said there are several reasons behind the dramatic rise.\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to get credit for mortgages now than it used to be, and the amount that can be obtained is much larger,\u201d said Lavoie, who\u2019s also an economics professor at the University of Ottawa. \u201cWages have not risen at the same speed as labour productivity. If wages don\u2019t grow as fast as they should, then the cost of houses in terms of wage rates is going to rise as well.\u201dThe study, based on average weekly earnings numbers from Statistics Canada, showed the average home price equating to 200 weeks of work remained the same from 1970 until 1986 when real estate prices began to soar.The Bank of Canada stepped in and hiked short-term interest rates in the early 1980s to curb inflation which sent Canada into a recession. Prices peaked in 1989 and fell in some markets \u2013 like Toronto and Vancouver \u2013 by as much as 25 per cent.Lavoie said prices didn\u2019t regain their 1989 peak until 2006.\u201cYoung Canadians who wish to own their dwelling are much worse off than were their parents when they bought their house in the 1970s or during the first half of the 1980s,\u201d the report said.The skyrocketing prices of homes is a huge issue in Canada, especially in red-hot housing markets like Toronto and Vancouver.New numbers from the  show housing prices jumped more than $100,000 in just one year. The average sale price for homes in the Greater Toronto Area last month was $739,082. The average was $636,094 in April 2015.More broadly, the average home price in Canada rose from $439,477 in March 2015 to $508,567 in March 2016, according to the .\u201cIt gives a boost to the construction industry as long as they can find enough people to buy them,\u201d he said.\xa0 \u201cBut here\u2019s a negative effect on the rest of the economy because people cannot spend as much on other commodities.\u201dLavoie acknowledges that the homes being purchased have changed over time, and could lead to a price increase. For example, the average Canadian home in 1975 was 1,075 square feet and by 2013 that number had nearly doubled to 2,000 square feet .However, he says the affordability challenge has grown for a nearly a decade.\u201cCurrent and recent buyers need to devote many more weeks of labour time to the financing of their home than their predecessors,\u201d Lavoie said in the report. \u201cNo wonder so many young prospective buyers, especially those in major cities, feel that owning a residential unit is more like a long-distance dream.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire continues to take toll on Alberta oilsandsCALGARY \u2013 The wildfire ripping through the Fort McMurray, Alta., area continued to set back Alberta\u2019s crude industry Friday as concerns arose that the disaster may have taken out as much as half of Canada\u2019s oilsands output.It is difficult to say with certainty how much oilsands bitumen is offline because production levels have fluctuated throughout the week and companies have not disclosed precise figures.But Nick Lupick, an oilsands analyst for AltaCorp Capital, said his latest estimate is that between 1.1 million and 1.25 million barrels of oil per day have been knocked from oilsands production.The National Energy Board calculates that the oilsands sector produced about 2.5 million bpd in January and February.While the oilsands sites themselves have been spared from damage, many of the workers who operate them have been forced from their homes without any idea when they\u2019ll be able to return.\u201cThe reality is that no physical damage has been done, as of now, to any projects,\u201d Lupick said.\u201cIt\u2019s more about getting people back on their feet and allowing them time to recuperate before returning to work. That\u2019s how long this is going to take.\u201dOn Friday afternoon, Syncrude Canada confirmed that it had closed its Aurora surface mine, about 70 kilometres northeast of Fort McMurray, but that it was continuing to operate its Mildred Lake mine, 35 kilometres north of the city, at a reduced capacity.\u201cWe\u2019re focusing our operations to accommodate minimal staffing while maintaining safety,\u201d said spokesman Will Gibson, who said production from Syncrude\u2019s upgrader at Mildred Lake had been reduced but that he didn\u2019t know by how much.Suncor Energy said late Thursday night that it had closed both its Firebag and MacKay River thermal operations north of Fort McMurray. Those facilities produced about 237,000 bpd during the first quarter of this year.Earlier this week, Suncor closed its upgrader and two related oilsands surface mines, also north of the community. The upgrader has a capacity of about 350,000 bpd but was operating at a lower level due to a planned maintenance shutdown prior to the fire.Suncor spokesman Paul Newmarch said Friday that he didn\u2019t know when Suncor\u2019s operations would return to normal.Canada\u2019s oilsands are considered the third-largest reserves of crude oil in the world. They are estimated to contain 166 billion barrels of recoverable oil covering 142,000 square kilometres \u2014 an area larger than the island of Newfoundland.', u'Canada\u2019s economy to take a hit from Fort McMurray wildfires: economistsThe \xa0that have\xa0halted oil production and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes will have at least a\xa0short-term impact on the economy, economists say.\u201cSomething like 40 per cent of total oilsands production is now offline and that\u2019s going to be subtracting directly from GDP in May,\u201d says\xa0Gerard Walsh, an economist with RBC Economics.Previously, GDP had been forecast to show a small gain in May.\u201cAs a result of these fires we\u2019re looking at a loss of about 0.4 per cent, a fairly large decline on a monthly basis,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that hits directly on our quarterly outlook for the second quarter this year. We\u2019re now looking at 0.5 per cent growth in Q2.\u201dWhile the Q2 outlook has weakened, it should rebound in Q3, growing at three per cent.The sooner oil production gets going again the better, but that hinges not only on the wildfires but also the damage left behind, and how soon people can\xa0get back to working \u2014 and living \u2014 in the area. Approximately 80,000 people have left the Fort McMurray area since Sunday.In 2011, approximately 40 per cent of Slave Lake, Alta., a community of 7,000, was lost to fire.That fire\xa0\u201ccoincided with a 3.6 per cent drop in the month\u2019s energy output which led GDP to contract 0.2 per cent in that month,\u201d said\xa0Krishen Rangasamy, Senior Economist National Bank, in an email to Global News.He says it\u2019s \u201cnot looking good\u201d for May\u2019s GDP, which would lead to a weak second-quarter following a strong start to the year in Q1.\u201cImpact of the May 2016 fires could be more devastating given the entire town of Fort McMurray is being evacuated,\u201d\xa0Rangasamy said.\xa0\u201cMoreover, energy\u2019s share in Canadian GDP is now higher than back in May 2011.\u201dColin\xa0Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Canada agrees the scale of this disaster is somewhat unprecedented, and the impact is hard to predict.While oil prices have dropped, the sector is still a \u201chuge engine\u201d for Canada\u2019s economy as a whole. But, Cieszynski says, the farther you get from Alberta, the less of an impact Canadians will feel.One place all Canadians could get\xa0stung\xa0is at the pumps, but likely not far beyond the usual fluctuations. But that, again, hinges on how soon oil production can resume. While Canada\u2019s lower output is unlikely to have a great impact on global prices, it could push them up domestically.\u201cThere is a possibility you could see an increase in gasoline prices\u2026 it depends also on the stockpiles,\u201d\xa0Cieszynski says.Even after the fires abate and people can return, it\u2019s unclear how much will be left of\xa0Fort McMurray and surrounding areas. Early estimates said 1,600 homes and buildings\xa0have been destroyed.\u201cIt\u2019s a big question mark: how long will it take for oilsands producers to return to full capacity and absolutely, the tragedy of what\u2019s happened to people themselves,\u201d Walsh says. \t\t\t\n\t\tThe region will feel the ripple effect by way of day-to-day spending all but drying up at stores, restaurants and other businesses.In the long run there will be a boost to the local economy as the communities rebuild.\xa0The caveat there is where those rebuild dollars will come from.

Manufacturing work in the Prairie province was down 17.7 per cent compared to the year before.With the wildfire continuing to rage in Alberta, it\u2019s unclear how significant the economic fallout will be in the province.Last month, the Canadian economy added 35,000 services jobs, which was largely due to surges of 26,800 positions in wholesale and retail trade and 21,900 in accommodation and food services.Services also saw losses of 16,000 positions in the category of business, building and other support services and a drop of 11,900 jobs in other services.The number of employee positions in Canada increased in April by 22,800, while self-employed jobs fell by 24,900.Overall Canadian employment last month was up 0.8 per cent compared to 12 months earlier, the report said.That flat national job number matched the projection of a consensus of economists, who had also predicted the jobless rate to creep up to 7.2 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.', u'CRA goes to court seeking RBC client infoOTTAWA \u2013 The Canada Revenue Agency has gone to Federal Court seeking information on Royal Bank clients referred to in the Panama Papers leak.The agency asked the court Wednesday to order the Royal Bank (TSX:RY) to disclose information on clients linked to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.Royal Bank said it will not oppose the motion and will comply if the court order is issued.The move is the latest development following reports issued by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists based on some 11.5 million leaked records from Mossack Fonseca.The Toronto Star and the CBC, the Canadian members of the consortium, reported that the Royal Bank and its subsidiaries used the law firm to help set up about 370 companies in offshore havens like Panama for its clients.In a statement Thursday, the Royal Bank said it respects the confidentiality of clients \u201cwithin the bounds of the law,\u201d while adding that it also co-operates with all regulators.The Royal Bank has said there are legitimate reasons to set up an offshore holding company, but if it believes a client intends to commit a criminal offence by evading taxes, it would report that to authorities and no longer serve the client.National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier had instructed the CRA to obtain the data leaked through the Panama Papers in order to cross-reference it with information already obtained through existing investigation tools.Chloe Luciani-Girouard, a spokeswoman for the minister, said Thursday that the CRA has already identified 45 potential Canadian taxpayers linked to the information and that audits will begin shortly.', u'Education tax credits were mostly used by top-earners: PBOOTTAWA \u2013 The country\u2019s highest-earning families benefited disproportionately from tax breaks and incentives designed to help people save and pay for post-secondary education, says a new report from the budget watchdog.The parliamentary budget officer says in 2015, families that were among the top 20 per cent of earners received 37.7 per cent of the total non-refundable tax credits for education, textbook and tuition expenses.The report says over the last decade, those top-earning households have received a larger chunk of the credits, much as an internal government review found the same group has benefited disproportionately from registered education savings plans.The analysis says while the highest-earning families claimed the majority of the tax relief, the per-family benefits were more evenly distributed regardless of income.The education and textbook tax credits , with the money targeted at more non-repayable grants and help with loan repayments. The report said these moves should make post-secondary education more affordable for lower-income students.Michael McDonald, executive director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, said the report shows the inefficiencies in the system, built on inadequate credits and savings programs.The alliance and its counterpart, the Canadian Federation of Students, have long called for changes to the grants and loan system to offer more money in up-front grants to low-income students rather than have them pay for tuition and then claim credits later.The Liberal budget increased spending by $684 million over the next two years on non-repayable student grants to middle and low-income students, broadened eligibility for federal student loans and eliminated several tax credits to help cover the cost of the changes.The budget didn\u2019t increase funding for a program aimed at helping aboriginal youth pay for college or university \u2014 a promise the Liberals made during the election.The PBO report said that without any change in policy direction, inflation-adjusted spending will decline by 6.7 per cent over the next five years.Bilan Arte, national chairperson of the student federation, said the report should be a warning for the federal government to start thinking about giving money to provinces specifically for post-secondary education to drive down tuition costs.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming evident to us that we can\u2019t just put a Band-Aid on a problem that is increasing becoming a crisis in Canada,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a bold new plan.\u201dThe report says even though education is generally a provincial responsibility, the federal government contributed $12.3 billion to post-secondary education in 2013-14. Changes in the Liberal\u2019s first budget are expected to push that spending to $15.7 billion by 2020.It also says in 2011 Canada spent 2.8 per cent of its gross domestic product on post-secondary education \u2014 more than any other OECD country.The budget watchdog warned that determining federal spending on post-secondary education is not an exact science because billions provided to provinces through one transfer payment could be spent on any number of social programs.Unlike transfer payments for health care, provinces don\u2019t have report how the social services transfers are spent, nor are they subject to parliamentary review.', u'Galen Weston wants Loblaw to get in on the medical marijuana businessTORONTO \u2013 Galen G. Weston wants in on the  business.Weston, the head of the country\u2019s largest drugstore and grocery chain, said Thursday that pharmacists are well-positioned to dispense the drug in a safe manner.\u201cWe\u2019re an industry that is extremely effective at managing controlled substances,\u201d said Weston, Loblaw\u2019s president and executive chairman, following the company\u2019s annual general meeting Thursday.\u201cIt gives pharmacists the opportunity to work directly in real time with patients as opposed to doing it through the mail, working on their doses and making sure it actually has the therapeutic effect that it is intended to have.\u201dAlthough he doesn\u2019t see any \u201csafety or credibility\u201d issues with the current mail system, where patients are sent the drug from a licensed producer, Weston said patients would be able to receive more consultation if the dispensing was done face-to-face.If given the go-ahead from Ottawa, \xa0would be open to dispensing medical cannabis in all forms, at all their Shoppers Drug Mart and grocery pharmacy locations, Weston added.The pitch from Weston is not entirely new. A spokeswoman for Shoppers Drug Mart delivered a similar take in February in its efforts to persuade the federal government to allow pharmacists to sell medical marijuana.Still, his comments mark the latest sign that the marijuana industry is increasingly seen as a legitimate way for businesses to make money in a hyper-competitive retail sector.Loblaw is not directly lobbying Ottawa on the issue, but it is supporting the Canadian Pharmacists Association in its efforts.Last month, the professional group updated its stance, saying it had growing concerns over what it calls a \u201clack of clinical oversight\u201d in the use of medical marijuana if pharmacies don\u2019t play a \u201cfront-line role\u201d in providing access to the drug.The Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada, whose members include London Drugs, I.D.A. and Rexall, also holds a similar view.Under Health Canada\u2019s rules, patients are only able to buy medical marijuana from licensed producers and are no longer permitted to grow their own, something they were allowed to do prior to 2013.In February, a B.C. court recently struck down the law as unconstitutional. Federal Court Judge Michael Phelan ruled that forcing patients to buy marijuana through the mail from a licensed producer was an \u201carbitrary and overbroad\u201d violation of patients\u2019 charter rights.Ottawa is looking at making changes to the regulations and expects to complete the process in August.The Liberal government has also committed to legalizing recreational marijuana use, although no timeline has been given on that initiative.Weston said Loblaw is currently focused only on the distribution of marijuana for medical use, not recreational use.\xa0\xa0', u'Woman accidentally given $4.6M by bank, spends most of it on \u2018luxury\u2019 itemsA 21-year-old Malaysian student who became a multimillionaire by accident when a bank mistakenly transferred $4.6 million to her account, is facing charges after blowing most of the money on luxury goods.A \u201cglitch\u201d in Westpac\u2019s system, a bank in Australia, reportedly sent the money transfer four years ago.Police say Christine Lee, an engineering student at the University of Sydney, spent $3.3 million on designer goods such as luxury handbags. Police say she also transferred cash to other accounts. So far, $1.3 million of the money has been reportedly recovered.Lee was arrested this week at the Sydney Airport in Australia when she was catching a flight to Malaysia. Police fraud experts launched their investigation in 2012, but a warrant for her arrest was only issued in March this year.It wasn\u2019t until Lee tried to leave the country that they were able to find her.She is charged with dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire forces oilsands to scale back productionThe  dealt a blow Wednesday to crude operations, with companies curtailing production or stopping it altogether.Shell Canada shut down output at its Albian Sands oilsands mining operations, which have the capacity to produce 255,000 barrels of oil per day. The site is located about 70 kilometres north of Fort McMurray.The company said it made the decision to focus on getting employees and their families out of the region while also freeing up room at its 2,000-person work camp for some of the 80,000 people who were ordered evacuated Tuesday from Fort McMurray.\u201cRight now, our priority is providing support for our people, their loved ones and others in the area,\u201d Shell spokesman Cameron Yost said in an email.Shell also employed its landing strip to fly employees and their families to Calgary or Edmonton and has provided two teams to support firefighting efforts in the area.Operations were also scaled back at the two largest and oldest oilsands mining operations in the Fort McMurray area.Suncor Energy said Thursday it is working with third-party lodging partners to safely evacuate all Suncor employees and contractors from Barge Landing.Syncrude Canada also reduced the number of people and machines working at its Mildred Lake oilsands mine 35 kilometres north of Fort McMurray. The company was also sheltering 2,000 employees and family members at its work camp.Husky Energy said it was cutting production at its recently commissioned Sunrise thermal oilsands project from 30,000 barrels per day to 10,000 bpd because the fire had forced the closure of a diluent supply pipeline. Sunrise, situated about 60 kilometres northeast of Fort McMurray, uses steam injected into a well to produce bitumen and the diluent, a light oil product, is used to thin it enough to allow it to flow in a pipeline to market.Inter Pipeline, whose systems move about 30 per cent of northern Alberta\u2019s bitumen to market, said it shut off its Corridor pipeline system and partially closed its Polaris diluent pipeline system in the Fort McMurray area as a precaution. No assets have been damaged by the fire, the company said.Michael Dunn, an oilsands analyst for Calgary investment firm FirstEnergy Capital, said the fire could lead to gasoline price hikes throughout the country, depending on how much damage has been done and how long it takes the industry to recover.\u201cIf this fire does cause an extended period of misplacement of the workforce or movement of them, this may impact the output of a lot of these oilsands mines and upgraders,\u201d he said.Canada\u2019s oilsands are considered the third-largest reserves of crude oil in the world, with 166 billion barrels of recoverable oil covering 142,000 square kilometres.About 80 per cent of Canada\u2019s oilsands are buried too deep for mining and must be recovered through wells. Bitumen ore mined at the surface is considered to be much less flammable than other types of petroleum because it is full of impurities such as sand.All large oilsands sites have emergency crews and plans for fires, including procedures to shut in facilities to minimize damage.Most flights in and out of the Fort McMurray International Airport southeast of the city centre were cancelled just before noon.', u'Loonie plunges again, bringing two-day decline to 2.1 centsTORONTO \u2013 Weak commodity prices continued to put pressure on the Canadian dollar Wednesday, as the loonie fell for a second day in a row, dropping almost a penny against the U.S. dollar.The loonie lost 0.96 of a U.S. cent to close at 77.70 cents US, adding to a decline of 1.11 cents on Tuesday.\u201cCurrencies tend to overshoot and undershoot,\u201d said Laura Lau, a senior portfolio manager at Brompton Group.The Canadian dollar dropped below 69 cents US in January and Lau said the volatility in the loonie has been a difficult factor for investors and companies to navigate, and will only stabilize once oil prices become more predictable.\u201cFor instance, you really want a lower dollar to entice manufacturing capacity to come back to Canada, but anybody who tries to build a plant, they can\u2019t build it on these fluctuations,\u201d she said.\u201cYou need time and a more stable currency.\u201dLau noted that production shutdowns in the Alberta oilsands due to the wildfire in Fort McMurray have not affected overall oil prices for now because investors still view the moves as temporary.Commodity prices were mixed Wednesday with the June contract for North American benchmark crude oil ahead for the first time in four days, adding 13 cents at US$43.73 per barrel. Crude has fallen sharply since trading at more than US$100 a barrel in 2014.\u201cIn general, if there is any one commodity that you would link to global growth, it would be oil,\u201d Lau said. \u201cPeople tend to use that as a barometer for global growth. If the oil prices are doing well, sentiment is better and they think the economy is doing better.\u201dSentiment is at a low because of the latest manufacturing figures released from China this week, which showed another contraction and spurred concerns over global growth.In other commodities, June natural gas was up five cents at US$2.14 per mmBTU, while the June gold contract fell $17.40 to US$1,274.40 an ounce. July copper contracts were down three cents to US$2.19 a pound.Gold, materials and mining stocks weighed on the S&P/TSX index, which pulled back 75.68 points at 13,632. The losses were partially offset by gains in the consumer staples, utilities and real estate sectors.In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 99.65 points at 17,651.26, while the broader S&P 500 lost 12.25 points at 2,051.12. The Nasdaq composite declined 37.58 points to 4,725.64.Payroll processor ADP reported Wednesday that U.S. businesses added jobs at the weakest pace in three years last month.\xa0', u'Oil price, loonie tumble as Chinese economy continues to struggleTORONTO \u2013 The latest round of sluggish manufacturing data from China weighed heavily on commodities Tuesday and sent reverberations through North American stock markets and the Canadian dollar as the currency plunged more than a cent.The S&P/TSX composite index retreated 157.95 points at 13,707.68 as concerns over the global economy dragged down the commodity-sensitive loonie.The dollar lost 1.11 cents to 78.66 cents US after some recent strong gains that saw it briefly touch 80 cents US late last week.Much of the blame was put on the latest figures from Caixin magazine\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index, which reported that China\u2019s manufacturing sector declined to a reading of 49.4 points from March\u2019s reading of 49.7. A number below 50 indicates that manufacturing is contracting and spurred fears that growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy is slowing.\u201cAny negative macro news would weigh on markets,\u201d said Ben Jang, a portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth Management in Vancouver.The Chinese data left the June contract for benchmark North American crude $1.13 lower at US$43.65 a barrel, while June gold bullion shed $4 to US$1291.80 a troy ounce. July copper was off five cents at US$2.22 a pound. June natural gas rebounded, climbing four cents to US$2.09 per mmBtu after having declined 14 cents on Monday.China is a large producer and consumer of commodities, and when data shows a contraction in its economy, it greatly impacts commodity markets. Worries about China were largely responsible for turmoil in global financial markets in the early part of the year.Jang said the figures from Caixin are often regarded by investors as a more reliable gauge of Chinese economic health than the official figures from government officials because it looks at small-to-medium companies rather than just only large firms.In other economic news, the European Union trimmed its economic growth forecasts for the 19 countries that share the euro currency, citing an unpredictable global outlook marked by political uncertainty and weakness in emerging markets.Adding to the worries about China and Europe, Australia\u2019s central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to a record low to help stimulate its battered economy. The news sent the Australian dollar down more than two per cent.In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average more than erased Monday\u2019s 117-point gain, falling 140.25 points to 17,750.91. The broader S&P 500 lost 18.06 points to 2,063.37 and the Nasdaq fell 54.37 points to 4,763.22.\u201cThe markets don\u2019t like uncertainty and there is a lot of uncertainty on the global side, the macro side, in the coming few months,\u201d said Jang, citing the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the decision by the U.K. in June on whether it to leave the EU.\xa0', u'Should Canada eliminate the nickel? New study says it will happen within 5 yearsCanada should do away with the nickel within the next five years and move to 10-, 20-, and 50-cent coins, a new report from Desjardins said Tuesday.The Quebec-based financial services company\xa0 the nickel should go the way of the penny, which the federal government abolished in its .Desjardins economist Hendrix Vachon writes that he sees the transition happening \u201cwithin about five years.\u201d\u201cDue to the gradual increase in the cost of living and decreased buying power of small coins, the time will come when the nickel will have to be taken out of circulation,\u201d Vachon wrote.The report said the change would also require removing the 25-cent piece and introducing 20-cent and 50-cent pieces.\u201cWe removed the penny, because the cost over time increased and increased and eventually reached a point where its cost was higher than its benefit for society,\u201d Vachon told Global News. \u201cThe same future is expected for the nickel.Eventually the cost of manipulating nickels, transporting, and accounting for nickels will be too high for its benefit for society.\u201dThe nickel isn\u2019t the only currency in the bank\u2019s sights.A 2008 study from Desjardins suggested getting rid of the $5 bill in favour of a coin, but now the group says Canada\u2019s switch to the new polymer bills has changed that.\u201cThe shift from paper to polymer bills lessens the need for this change, as it has substantially increased the lifespan of the notes,\u201d Desjardins said, but \u201ceventually, the evolution of buying power could still justify changing to a $5 coin.\u201dDespite other countries like Sweden moving towards a cashless economy, Canada is not likely to follow suit, according the study.While Bank of Canada data shows Canadians are using cash less often to actually pay for things \u2014 down to roughly 44 per cent of all transactions in 2013 \u2013 there\u2019s currently $80 billion worth of Canadian coins and bank notes in circulation, and the amount of cash is growing at a pace of between four and seven per cent per year.Larger denomination bills \u2013 \xa0like $100- and $50-bills \u2013 are becoming more popular, while the $5-, $10- and $20-bills are losing ground.\u201cThese bills are likely little used to purchase goods and services and are more likely used for hoarding purposes,\u201d Vachon wrote.The study notes that some of the arguments for moving away from cash include combating illegal activity and the underground economy, creating more efficient monetary policy, and reducing transaction costs.', u'Calgary-based Encana posts US$379M loss in first quarterCalgary-based Encana Corp. (TSX:ECA) reported Tuesday a US$379-million net loss for the first quarter mainly due to writedowns and lower oil and gas prices as revenue fell 40 per cent compared with the same time last year.A year ago, the oil and gas producer had a US$1.71-billion loss, also mainly due to asset writedowns.The company, which reports in U.S. dollars, also said it is taking a $31-million restructuring charge to account for a 20 per cent reduction in its workforce in March.Revenue after royalty payments fell to $753 million for the three months ended March 31, down from $1.25 billion in the same period last year. Analysts had estimated about $657 million of revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Doug Suttles returned again and again to the positive side of the downturn, noting that drilling and well completion costs in Encana\u2019s four core regions were between 22 per cent and 44 per cent lower in the first quarter than in 2015 due to performance improvements and reduced oilfield service costs.He said the most recent round of job cuts, which dropped Encana\u2019s head count to about 1,600 or half of what it was in 2013, was planned so that the company can begin growing again when commodity prices strengthen.Encana\u2019s cash flow, a measure of its ability to reinvest, fell to $102 million from $383 million on lower oil and gas prices.Encana reported oil and natural gas liquids production rose eight per cent to 130,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to the year-earlier period. Natural gas output fell 18 per cent to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day, with almost all of the shortfall in Canada.', u'TransAlta CEO concerned about coal power phase-out timelineCALGARY \u2013 The CEO of TransAlta Corp. (TSX:TA) says she has misgivings about the pace and complexity of the Alberta government\u2019s efforts to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2030.While discussing first-quarter earnings Tuesday, Dawn Farrell said the Calgary-based power provider is looking for clarification from the government on incentives to encourage building alternative power sources, mainly natural-gas fired, to replace coal.In November, the government said all coal-fired power plants would be forced to shut down or be emissions-free by 2030 as part of Premier Rachel Notley\u2019s plan to address climate change. Coal power companies in Alberta are looking for compensation from the government for the early shutdown.The NDP government appointed American power expert Terry Boston in March to come up with a report on how to proceed. That is due in September.\u201cThis seems like a pretty short period for concluding what I believe is a very historic and very significant process,\u201d Farrell said on a conference call with investors.\u201cNevertheless, we\u2019re all incented to achieve the best solution. This will give investors the confidence to invest capital in Alberta and TransAlta.\u201dTwelve of Alberta\u2019s 18 coal-fired generating units are expected to shut down before 2030 under federal regulations. Boston is to concentrate on finding ways to close the six others.Earlier this year, Farrell criticized the government for taking longer than expected to appoint someone to guide the process to phase out coal. She said TransAlta\u2019s capital projects in Alberta would remain on hold until the new rules are known.On Tuesday, she said initial meetings took place last month with Boston, who appears to be a \u201cvery talented man\u201d who won\u2019t take long to gain familiarity with the Alberta marketplace.Alberta\u2019s Economic Development Department did not return a request for an update on the process.TransAlta reported adjusted earnings of $279 million in the first quarter ended March 31, an increase of $4 million over the same period in 2015, despite spot power prices that fell to historic lows in Alberta.Twelve of Alberta\u2019s 18 coal-fired generating units are expected to shut down before 2030 under federal regulations, and Boston is to concentrate on finding ways to close the six others.', u'Why everyone wants to know if Craig Wright really invented BitcoinLOS ANGELES \u2013 The mystery creator of the digital currency bitcoin has finally stepped forward. Or has he?Australian inventor Craig Steven Wright announced Monday that  the elusive, pseudonymous bitcoin founder.In interviews with the and a few bitcoin insiders, bolstered by a technical demonstration intended to prove that he and Nakamoto are one and the same, Wright tried to lay to rest one of the biggest mysteries in the tech world.But Wright, who first emerged as a leading Nakamoto contender last December , may not have closed the case.While some bitcoin experts accept  that Wright is indeed Nakamoto, others argue that his supposed proof \u2013 a series of complex mathematical operations listed in a blog post \u2013 doesn\u2019t prove anything.Bitcoin allows people a way to make payments without using banks or national currencies such as the dollar or the euro. Because bitcoin transactions are unregulated and anonymous, the currency has proved popular among libertarians, tech enthusiasts, speculators and criminals. Nakamoto, who founded the currency in 2009, dropped out of sight in 2010, but bitcoin has mostly chugged along without him.Knowing who actually founded bitcoin wouldn\u2019t have any immediate effect on the digital currency.But the founder might have standing to weigh in on a bitter technical dispute that threatens to hamper bitcoin\u2019s growth. And the real Nakamoto would be rich and able to disrupt bitcoin just by selling chunks of his holdings. Nakamoto possesses around 1 million bitcoins worth some $440 million; those coins have never been touched.Wright\u2019s announcement is the latest twist in the long search for the real Nakamoto, a pursuit that\u2019s become a cottage industry for journalists and online sleuths.In 2011,  focused speculation on cryptography researcher Michael Clear, who denied it. Newsweek fingered Japanese-American engineer Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto more than a year ago, though this Nakamoto quickly insisted in an AP interview that it was a clumsy case of mistaken identity.Gavin Andresen, an early bitcoin developer who had extensive dealings with Nakamoto before he vanished, says yes.  Andresen said Wright demonstrated that he holds the key associated with some of the earliest bitcoins created.Others are dubious, largely because Wright\u2019s public \u201cproof\u201d of his identify was totally different \u2013 and, to them, far less convincing \u2013 than his private demonstration to Andresen.\u201cTo me, he proved absolutely nothing,\u201d said , a computer science professor at Cornell University. Sirer and others said Wright\u2019s blog post mainly amounts to a little sleight of hand using publicly available data.Jerry Brito, executive director of the Washington-based cryptocurrency think-tank Coin Center, questioned why Wright provided the supposed proof only in private exchanges with Andresen and a few others.Wright claims he has come forward now because media speculation about his involvement with bitcoin has violated the privacy of his staff. He told the Economist that he wanted to \u201cset the record straight,\u201d and in the BBC report he said that he isn\u2019t seeking fame or money and just wants to be left alone.Those might not be the only reasons. Wright is being investigated by Australian tax authorities and might need money. Going public might make it easier for him to cash in Nakamoto\u2019s bitcoins.', u'Enbridge predicting $62M in fines in connection with oil spillMARSHALL, Mich. \u2013 A pipeline company says it expects $62 million in fines and penalties related to a 2010 Michigan oil spill.In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enbridge says $55 million represents penalties under federal water law. The Alberta-based company says no final fine or penalty has been ordered yet as negotiations continue with the U.S. government.Enbridge says about 20,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Kalamazoo River system, near Marshall, from a ruptured line in 2010.Enbridge says total costs from the disaster are pegged at $1.2 billion. The company says most of the costs are covered by insurance.', u'Alberta Catholic school district spent $367,000 on legal battle with transgender teacherEDMONTON \u2013 Greater St. Albert Catholic Schools has so far spent $367,000 of taxpayer dollars on a legal battle with a teacher who was fired after undergoing gender-reassignment surgery.\xa0got the number after making a request to the school board under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.\u201cI think taxpayers have a right to know how this school board is spending their money,\u201d Progress Alberta\u2019s Duncan Kinney said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money. That\u2019s a lot of money that could be going to students. That\u2019s a lot of money that could be going to teachers.\u201dJan Buterman was removed from the Greater St. Albert School Division\u2019s teacher list in 2008 because the gender-reassignment surgery was not in line with Catholic values, according to a letter sent by the school district to Buterman.\u201cNo one has ever investigated my case,\u201d Buterman told Global News. \u201cNo one has ever sat down as a tribunal to say here\u2019s what happened.\u201dButerman filed a complaint in 2009, which the school district successfully challenged before the province\u2019s human rights commission. The FOIP release shows the school district spent $63,878 in 2009 on the case.\u201cI totally get why that seems like a lot of money because it is a lot of money on a point that shouldn\u2019t be confusing,\u201d Buterman said. \u201cFor some years in advance of me getting this job, it was already clear in writing that one\u2019s gender identity was not something that one could be discriminated against.\u201dIn 2011, Buterman turned down a $78,000 cash settlement offer from the publicly funded school district because it would have required him to keep quiet and drop his human rights complaint.In 2014, a chief of the commission overturned the 2009 decision. The school district sought a judicial review, but Justice Sheila Greckol of Court of Queen\u2019s Bench dismissed the district\u2019s request.Greater St. Albert Catholic Schools Superintendent David Keonhane released the following statement to Global News on Monday:\u201cThis is a personnel matter that is currently being appealed as of April 14th to the Alberta Court of Appeal, therefore we are not in a position to comment.\u201dButerman said he has no plans to give up his fight to appeal what he calls his wrongful dismissal.\u201cWe see in all kinds of struggles for rights in the world, present and historical. We see that whenever progress is made, there\u2019s also a great deal of resistance to that progress.\u201d\u201cThe fact that this case has gone on for so long with no resolution in sight is really a travesty of justice,\u201d Kinney said.\xa0', u'BCE to buy Manitoba Telecom Services in $3.9B dealTORONTO \u2013 BCE Inc. has signed a friendly deal valued at $3.9 billion to buy Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., one of the few regional independent rivals to Canada\u2019s three main national telecommunications companies.The agreement announced Monday would add Manitoba\u2019s largest phone, Internet and wireless company to BCE\u2019s Montreal-based business, which includes the CTV television network, the former Chum and Astral radio chains and Bell Canada.\u201cUnder the terms of this transaction, MTS will achieve much more than it could have as an independent company,\u201d Manitoba Telecom president and CEO Jay Forbes said in a conference call with analysts.\u201cBCE\u2019s commitment to invest $1 billion over five years into Manitoba\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure will also contribute greatly to the prosperity of our province and the quality of our customer experience.\u201dBCE has also agreed in principle to sell about one-third of Manitoba Telecom\u2019s monthly contract wireless customers and one-third of the MTS stores in Manitoba to Vancouver-based Telus Corp. (TSX:T).The deal requires approval from the Competition Bureau, which has previously advocated increased competition in the wireless sector.Aravinda Galappatthige, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said the deal could lead to further consolidation in the wireless industry.\u201cIf BCE-MBT is approved, we believe this would set a significant precedent, as it would reduce Manitoba to a three-player wireless market from four,\u201d Galappatthige said in a note to clients.Bell trails Toronto-based Rogers and Telus in terms of wireless customers, but BCE is by far the largest of the three in terms of overall market value at more than $51 billion, compared with $23.7 billion for Telus and $19.7 billion for Rogers.Rogers had nearly 9.9 million subscribers to its various wireless services as of Dec. 31, compared with 8.45 million at Telus and 8.24 million at Bell. MTS Mobility had 483.000 subscribers.Under the deal, Manitoba Telecom (TSX:MBT) would need to sever its commercial ties with Rogers Communications Inc., (TSX:RCI.B) which has been providing it with wholesale access to the national market.The network sharing arrangement with Rogers \u201cis underpinned by a complex set of agreements that we plan to work through in the coming months as we work to closing,\u201d Forbes said.But neither Forbes nor BCE president and CEO George Cope provided details on what it might cost to unwind the Rogers relationship or what Telus would pay to acquire its share of the MTS wireless subscribers.Cope said BCE\u2019s acquisition of MTS doesn\u2019t depend on completion of the deal with Telus and further details will be announced later.\u201cClearly, Telus\u2019s position in the wireless industry is significantly enhanced in this transaction, as is Bell\u2019s,\u201d Cope said.\u201cSo you\u2019d expect, I think, the market to continue to be as competitive as it has been \u2013 if not maybe even more \u2013 as a result of all this.\u201dThe acquisition would add 2,700 employees from Manitoba Telecom to BCE\u2019s Bell phone business. Bell\u2019s western operation would nearly double to 6,900 people and operate as Bell MTS, headquartered in Winnipeg.While often allies, BCE and Manitoba Telecom have occasionally had a combative and competitive relationship.At one time, BCE was a large shareholder of Manitoba Telecom and there was widespread speculation that it would buy full ownership of the company.But Manitoba Telecom took a different path to remain independent and decided to buy Allstream, a Toronto-based company that competes directly with BCE nationally for business customers.MTS announced in November that it would sell Allstream to Zayo Group of Boulder, Colo., in a $465-million cash deal that closed in January.BCE (TSX:BCE) is offering $40 per share, about 45 per cent in cash and 55 per cent in stock, for MTS shares (TSX:MBT). The deal would also see BCE assume about $800 million in debt.BCE would have the opportunity to match any superior offer that may come forward. Each side has agreed to pay a $120-million break fee under certain circumstances if the deal isn\u2019t completed.', u'Justin Trudeau non-committal over Bombardier funding, talks continueMONTREAL \u2013 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government is continuing to negotiate with Bombardier to establish the \u2018right business case\u2019 for federal investment in the company.Trudeau praised the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s CSeries jets today but did not provide any further details on whether Ottawa would grant the company\u2019s request for federal funding.He commented on the issue following a speech he gave to the biennial convention of the Liberal party\u2019s Quebec wing in Montreal.The Quebec government has promised US$1 billion of public money for Bombardier and the company is seeking a similar sum from Ottawa.Premier Philippe Couillard has called on the Trudeau government to do its part after the announcement earlier this week that Delta had placed an order with the company for 75 CS100 aircraft with options for an additional 50 planes.']

[u'National Spelling Bee co-champions include youngest everOXON HILL, Md. \u2013 The words were tougher. The final rounds lasted longer. The result was the same.The Scripps National Spelling Bee ended in a tie for the  Thursday night, with Jairam Hathwar and Nihar Janga declared co-champions after a roller-coaster finish.Thirteen-year-old Jairam is the younger brother of the 2014 co-champion, Sriram Hathwar. Nihar, at age 11, is the youngest winner of the bee on record.\u201cI\u2019m just speechless. I can\u2019t say anything,\u201d Nihar said as he hoisted the trophy. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m only in fifth grade!\u201dScripps made the bee tougher after two consecutive ties, forcing the last two spellers to get through three times as many words as in years past.Jairam, of Painted Post, New York, misspelled two words. But both times, Nihar, of Austin, Texas, followed up with a miss and the bee continued. Sriram also got a word wrong during his bee, but his eventual co-champion, Ansun Sujoe, flubbed his chance at the solo title.\u201cI thought it was over, because Nihar is so strong, such a great speller,\u201d Sriram said.Each will receive a trophy and $45,000 in cash and prizes.Nihar celebrated by imitating the touchdown dance of his favourite athlete, Dallas Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant, who sent a tweet congratulating the young speller. Jairam, meanwhile, took inspiration from golfer Jordan Spieth, particularly his ability to bounce back after bad shots.\u201cWhen I missed those two words, I didn\u2019t let them get to my head, and I just focused on the next word,\u201d Jairam said.In another change, bee organizers didn\u2019t stick to a predetermined list of \u201cchampionship words\u201d for the last two or three spellers. No one will know whether the bee had harder words in reserve, but former spellers said Jairam and Nihar nailed the toughest words in recent memory.Because the best spellers become fluent in Latin and Greek roots, the bee went to words derived from trickier or more obscure languages, including Afrikaans, Danish, Irish Gaelic, Maori and Mayan.Jairam\u2019s winning word was Feldenkrais, which is derived from a trademark and means a system of body movements intended to ease tension. Niram won with gesellschaft, which means a mechanistic type of social relationship.Among the words they got right: Kjeldahl, Hohenzollern, juamave, groenedael, zindiq and euchologion.At his best, Nihar wowed the crowd by shouting out definitions immediately after the words were announced. He looked unbeatable. But given two chances to hold the trophy by himself, he stumbled.Nihar was in his first bee and would have had three more years of eligibility, but he can\u2019t compete again since he won. This was the 89th bee, and while Scripps\u2019 records from early years are incomplete, the youngest known champion was Wendy Guey, who won 20 years ago at age 12. The last to win in his first attempt was Pratyush Buddiga in 2002.Nihar said he didn\u2019t feel pressure to become the youngest winner for two reasons. First, he never expected to win. Second, most of the crowd\u2019s attention was on an even younger speller: 6-year-old Akash Vukoti.\u201cHe did pretty good for a first-grader,\u201d Nihar said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to go places.\u201dNihar and Jairam have become close friends over the past year, but Nihar said he didn\u2019t consider misspelling on purpose when he had chances to win. He just didn\u2019t know the words.\u201cI wanted to win, but at the same time I felt really bad for Jairam,\u201d Nihar said.Nihar and Jairam\u2019s parents are immigrants from south India, continuing a remarkable run of success for Indian-American spellers that began in 1999 with Nupur Lala\u2019s victory, which was later featured in the documentary \u201cSpellbound.\u201d The bee has produced Indian-American champions for nine straight years and 14 out of the last 19.Before 2014, the bee hadn\u2019t declared co-champions in more than 50 years, but now, it seems little can be done to avoid it. The competition concluded shortly before 11 p.m., with the winners having spent seven hours on stage, and bee executive director Paige Kimble has said she wouldn\u2019t consider forcing the final spellers to keep going indefinitely.Snehaa Kumar of Folsom, California, finished third, and Sylvie Lamontagne of Lakewood, Colorado, was fourth. Both are 13-year-old eighth-graders, meaning this year was their last chance.___', u'Gawker may be looking to sell after losing costly Hulk Hogan caseThe embattled online media company Gawker Media has hired an investment banker to explore its options, including a possible sale.Two months ago, Gawker lost a $140 million invasion-of-privacy suit against  over a sex tape of the wrestler that the site posted online.It emerged this week that Silicon Valley  was behind the suit.He told  that he has bankrolled lawyers to mount cases against Gawker because one of the company\u2019s blogs, the now-defunct Valleywag, posted a story in 2007 that said he was gay.The company also wrote other articles that he said he considered critical of his friends and others.Gawker said Thursday that it expects to prevail in an appeal of the Hogan verdict and that it\u2019s always said it is exploring contingency plans.The company would not say when the banker, Mark Patricof of Houlihan Lokey, was hired, other than to say \u201crecently.\u201d The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post earlier reported that Gawker was interested in a sale.Gawker hasn\u2019t said whether it could afford to pay the $140 million verdict. During the trial in Florida in March, Hogan\u2019s lawyer said Gawker Media\u2019s gross revenue in 2015 was $48.7 million.

Belly said he cancelled because he didn\u2019t want to share a stage with Trump and disagrees with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s views and beliefs.Trump has been criticized by some political rivals and voters for his comments on topics including women, refugees, immigrants and Muslims, such as when he said some Mexican immigrants in the U.S. illegally are \u201crapists\u201d and when he called for a ban on Muslim immigration into the United States.A Trump spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on The Weeknd and Belly.The Jimmy Kimmel show had no comment, a representative said.

For me, being Muslim and being somebody that appreciates my access here in America, I love the fact that I\u2019m able to be here. To play my part in this business is a privilege and a beautiful thing. The fact that I could lose that ability through the actions of someone such as Donald Trump isn\u2019t right to me.

First Nations master carver Norman Tait dead at 75VANCOUVER \u2013 Norman Tait, a Nisga\u2019a First Nation artist whose work is displayed around the world, has died at the age of 75.Tait was known for carving totems, but the self-taught artist\u2019s work also includes masks, jewelry and photos.He died of cancer in Vancouver on May 21, one day after his birthday.Valerie Tait, his oldest child, said in an interview Wednesday that her father\u2019s totems are on display in many locations, including his Nisga\u2019a home in northwest British Columbia, Chicago and Japan, and he even carved a pole for the Royal Family in London.She said he was thrilled by the Royal commission.\u201cEspecially when he was invited to go see her,\u201d she said, referring to Queen Elizabeth.The totem pole sits in Bushy Park, a royal park in London, and features at its base a killer whale, considered the monarch of the sea, and on the top, an eagle, the monarch of the air.Norman Tait graduated from the British Columbia Institute of Technology\u2019s millwright program in 1963 and later worked for the paper mill Skeena Cellulose in Prince Rupert, B.C.He moved his family to Vancouver in 1971 and while waiting for millwright work, began to carve.But Valerie Tait said there were no Nisga\u2019a carvers alive to teach him how it was done.\u201cThat\u2019s when he started looking in all the museums. He said he went through every place that he could find within his reach to study the work, the masters.\u201dShe said he soon began making more money carving than he did as a millwright.Tait was the first person to have a solo exhibit at Vancouver\u2019s Museum of Anthropology with 125 pieces, a show which his daughter said he was extremely proud of.His work was featured in three books, and showcased in numerous exhibitions, performances and videos.In 2012, he was presented with a British Columbia lifetime achievement award for his First Nations\u2019 Art.Valerie Tait said her dad\u2019s legacy will be long lasting because of his unique style and through the many he taught to carve, including her son, his grandson, Kristopher.She said her father hadn\u2019t finished a piece for a while before his death.\u201cIt really hurt to him have idle hands,\u201d she said.Norman Tait leaves behind his daughter, his son Micah, brothers and sisters, grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.', u'Amy Schumer slams body-shaming trolls in new Instagram postAmy Schumer is \u201cblocking out the haters\u201d in a\xa0recent Instagram post about body shaming.The 34-year-old comedian took to the social platform to share a photo from her Hawaiin trip with boyfriend Ben Hanisch.

Frank Bergen remembers it well \u2013 because he was assigned the unenviable task of standing up to the \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d at the height of her stardom.As the story went, police told Madonna\u2019s management they\u2019d received complaints from audience members at the previous evening\u2019s show over her simulated masturbation while singing \u201cLike a Virgin.\u201dOfficers said if she didn\u2019t scrap her crotch-grabbing antics at the SkyDome, now known as the Rogers Centre, they\u2019d be forced to arrest her on obscenity charges.Bergen, a 29-year-old Toronto constable at the time, was grappling with his own perspective on the situation.He says the obscenity kerfuffle was led by a police detective and Crown attorney who took a strong position that Madonna\u2019s show shouldn\u2019t go on.\u201cWhat I was struggling with was how do you go to the microphone and tell everyone the show is cancelled,\u201d Bergen says.\u201cMy role and my position was we were not going to shut the show down.\u201dThe confrontation was immortalized in \u201cMadonna: Truth or Dare,\u201d the singer\u2019s 1991 documentary. Looking back, he says the film didn\u2019t exactly capture the full story.\u201cWe were portrayed as being real knobs, if you will,\u201d he says.\u201cI don\u2019t think we were.\u201dSome of Madonna\u2019s dancers still fondly remember the backstage drama.\u201cOh, we wanted to get arrested, we really did,\u201d says Kevin Stea, who was part of the tour.\u201cThat may have been the most powerful moment I ever felt with Madonna. As a team we were all together.\u201dCancelling the show was an option \u2013 but one that Madonna didn\u2019t want to entertain.The tour had already been generating controversy for its racy themes. Toronto concertgoers were handed a $1-off coupon for condoms as they entered the stadium.Madonna also took a scripted moment in the show to encourage her male dancers to practice safe sex, in a nod to the HIV/AIDS epidemic that was near its peak.Both moments placed extra scrutiny on the show and led some critics to accuse the singer of encouraging young fans to partake in casual sex.A scene in \u201cTruth or Dare\u201d depicts Madonna gathered with her dancers and backup singers before the show for a prayer.\u201cDear Lord, this is our last night in Toronto \u2013 the fascist state of Toronto,\u201d she said.\u201cRemember that in the United States of America there is freedom of speech.\u201dShe then marched past Bergen and his colleagues, hand-in-hand with her singers singing \u201cHoliday,\u201d as he and his fellow officers watched the documentary cameras capture it all.The concert began and Madonna took advantage of the opportunity to tease Toronto police.\u201cDo you think that I\u2019m a bad girl?\u201d she asked the crowd to cheers. \u201cDo you think that I deserve to be arrested? I hope so.\u201dWhen \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d began, Madonna started the performance as she always did, curled up on a red velvet bed.Jose Gutierez, one of the dancers in the number, will never forget gazing into the abyss of the audience.\u201cFrom the stage you could see their (police) badges at all the exit signs around the arena,\u201d he recalls.\u201cAll you saw was shimmers.\u201dThen she moved on to her next hit.When the show wrapped, Madonna\u2019s entourage approached police to ensure they weren\u2019t going to cart the singer away.The officers assured them there were no problems.\u201cI think they just wanted free tickets,\u201d jokes Gutierez with a hint of disappointment.\u201cI was into seeing what the jail system in Toronto looked liked with Madonna. I mean, how bad could it be?\u201dMadonna\u2019s dancers recall touring with the pop singer in the upcoming documentary \u201cStrike a Pose,\u201d which recently screened at Toronto\u2019s Hot Docs film festival.Bergen says he respects concerns over obscenity but concedes it would\u2019ve been difficult to satisfy a \u201cloose interpretation of the Criminal Code.\u201dIt took a year before the officer would hear about his cinematic debut in \u201cTruth or Dare.\u201dOne afternoon, his teenage neighbour excitedly shouted across the backyard that he\u2019d spotted him on the big screen.Bergen admits his musical tastes didn\u2019t sway towards Madonna, so the sheer magnitude of her celebrity was lost on him at the time.And while he never spoke to Madonna himself, he ponders how the situation would\u2019ve played out had officers arrested her that night.\u201cI don\u2019t think we ever got to the (point), nor would we have, where we walked up onto the stage \u2013 and onto her bed \u2013 and handcuffed her,\u201d he says.\u201cThen we would\u2019ve been part of a different history.\u201d', u'\u2018Private Eyes\u2019: 5 reasons to watch the new Jason Priestley showCanadian star  has been a pretty constant staple on TV over\xa0the last few years, though you might not know it.

Here\u2019s what you need to know.OK, so it\u2019s not exactly like , since it features a man and a woman, but in terms of dichotomous personalities, Angie and Shade certainly fit the bill. Both characters are headstrong, and she shows him the ropes of how to become a private investigator. Together, they struggle with their new partnership.The chemistry between Priestley and Sampson is apparent right from the moment we arrived on set. They are constantly joking, making fun of one another, and straying way off-topic. In fact, it\u2019s hard to corral them; but one indisputable fact is the pair is having a ball shooting the show.\u201cWhy do people keep saying we have this chemistry?\u201d jokes Sampson as she smiles at Priestley.\u201cI know, we just keep f**king around!\u201d laughs Priestley. \u201cI don\u2019t know, she and I just come to work everyday and enjoy ourselves. The reality is we\u2019re here 80 hours a week, and we have the same sense of humour. We also have the same outlook on this show.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to enjoy every minute, and we get along very well,\u201d agrees Sampson. \u201cEverybody working around us is having a great time, too. It\u2019s a nice environment to be in.\u201d\u201cThe Angie character is the world\u2019s most cheerful cynic,\u201d laughs co-showrunner Alan McCullough. \u201cShe believes that people are as they are, and not in evolution, personal growth or change. Enter a guy who\u2019s desperately trying to prove that he can change, and there you have the show.\u201dThe powers-that-be behind the show tried their best to integrate the various neighbourhoods of Toronto, to showcase the vibrancy that exists in the city. In each episode,  seeks to depict a different place, from Toronto Island to the racetrack to the club district.\u201cWe\u2019re shooting Toronto, for Toronto, which is great,\u201d says Priestley. \u201cIt\u2019s a very international, multicultural and vibrant city. So why not celebrate it?\u201d\u201cStreetcars everywhere,\u201d quips Sampson. \u201cCN Tower. We\u2019re celebrating Toronto and all its glory.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a revitalization of Toronto going on internationally,\u201d says McCullough. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same city it was 25 years ago. Maybe they still think of Canada being backwards, but Toronto has managed to carve out its own niche as being a cool place.\u201d isn\u2019t all about the central couple, however; Shade has a daughter, Jules (Jordyn Negri), who suffers from macular degeneration, and a father, Don (Barry Flatman), who muddy the waters and make things more complicated. They have plotlines too, and viewers who don\u2019t necessarily identify with Angie and Shade can look to the peripheral cast for more.Jules may be legally blind, but she\u2019s also going through the typical things a teenager goes through: romance, school, the usual. Kids and teens may find themselves tuning in to watch her stories unfold.\u201cDon and Jules have an interesting relationship, too,\u201d says Negri about her grandfather on the show. \u201cWhen Matt [Shade] is off being a pro hockey player, Don played a fatherly role in raising her, and I think that really plays into the show now.\u201dDon is a solid working-class guy, proud of his family and home, and pleased with Shade\u2019s new acquaintance and colleague. Don feels like Angie is going to whip him into shape, for the better. Flatman, a veteran of the Canadian screen (51 years in the business!), can\u2019t recall the last time he enjoyed himself this much on set.\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you get a group of people who are so good at what they do,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone [on this show] is a great person, and that doesn\u2019t usually happen, especially across the board. Cast, crew, production\u2026 not that you need that to make great art or great work, but it sure helps. It is palpable.\u201dAside from the hockey aspect \u2014 Priestley, as a good Canadian boy, played the sport in his youth \u2014 there are many Canadian guest stars that people outside our borders may not recognize.Music artists Kardinal Offishall and King Reign, along with hockey legend Doug Gilmour and professional poker player Daniel Negreanu, make guest appearances, among others who shall remain anonymous.\u201cAgain, we\u2019re trying to get a good flavour of the city,\u201d says Priestley. \u201cWhat better way than showcasing some of Canada\u2019s talent?\u201d is definitely lighter than your standard procedural fare. You won\u2019t be curling into the fetal position after watching, but you might just laugh. Comedy runs through the show like a fine thread, and even Shade and Angie\u2019s first meeting goes in a direction you wouldn\u2019t expect.\u201cWhen we first meet, I punch a child,\u201d laughs Sampson. \u201cNo, I really do.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s punched a couple of children during the course of this show,\u201d says Priestley. \u201cOK, so they\u2019re 18. Not  young.\u201d\u201cThis is fun, this is going to be fun,\u201d says co-showrunner\xa0Shelley Eriksen. \u201cWe\u2019re not redoing . This isn\u2019t . We are making a fun, private detective show. I\u2019ve enjoyed those in my life, so I wanted to make my own. I loved  and I love , and the fun aspect is paramount in what we tried to make.\u201d', u'Was Prince a dad?

His mother contends in court papers that she conceived Williams while having sex with Prince at a hotel in 1976 in Kansas City, Missouri.A look at some other prominent Americans whose children surfaced years \u2014 sometimes decades \u2014 after they were born:Chuck Norris wrote about Dianna DeCioli in his 2004 memoir titled \u201cAgainst All Odds,\u201d acknowledging that his daughter was the result of a fling he had while married in late 1962.Norris said he and a woman he called Johanna dated for a \u201cfew months\u201d and only slept together once. He did not know about DeCioli until he received a letter from her in 1991.When the two met, he knew immediately that she was his child.\u201cI didn\u2019t need DNA or blood tests,\u201d Norris wrote. \u201cThere was no doubt in my mind that she was my daughter.\u201dGenetic tests proved last year that the nation\u2019s 29th president, Warren G.

Essie Mae Washington-Williams revealed herself as Thurmond\u2019s child in 2003, after Thurmond died at 100.The senator never publicly acknowledged her, but his family recognized Washington-Williams\u2019 claim after she came forward.Thurmond, who served in the Senate for more than 47 years, paid for her college education while governor of South Carolina and later helped her when she was widowed.Washington-Williams died in 2013.Jett Williams was born five days after Hank Williams Sr. died at 29 years old in 1953. Her mother was a girlfriend of Hank Williams Sr. between the country star\u2019s marriages.She fought for eight years to receive a share of her father\u2019s songwriting royalties and settled in court with Hank Williams Jr. in 1993.Jett Williams is now a singer and songwriter.Mia Farrow said in a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair that it\u2019s possible her son, NBC News reporter Ronan Farrow, is Frank Sinatra\u2019s son, not Woody Allen\u2019s.Farrow was married to Sinatra for 18 months and \u201cnever really split up,\u201d according to her.In response to the claims, Ronan Farrow tweeted, \u201cListen, we\u2019re all (asterisk) possibly (asterisk) Frank Sinatra\u2019s son.\u201dAt the time, a representative for Allen told The Associated Press that the article was \u201cso fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment.\u201d', u'Former \u2018Biggest Loser\u2019 contestants allege they were given diet pills to lose weightA handful of former  contestants are alleging they were starved, fed diet pills and forced to lie about how much they were eating, according to an exclusive .

PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2013 Is Hulk Hogan\u2019s courtroom cage match with  being bankrolled by a high-tech billionaire with a grudge against the news-and-gossip site?Two months after Hogan won a $140 million invasion-of-privacy verdict against Gawker for posting a sex tape of him, news reports say the pro wrestler is secretly backed by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook, was outed as gay by a Gawker-owned website in 2007, and the Gawker empire has run a number of stories skewering Facebook.On Wednesday, Hogan and Gawker were back in a Florida court, where Judge Pamela Campbell denied his request for a new trial and refused to reduce the damages. Gawker vows to take the case to an appeals court.Swirling in the background of the legal proceedings were reports in The New York Times and Forbes that Thiel is footing Hogan\u2019s legal bills against their common enemy, Gawker. The news stories cited unidentified sources.Thiel, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $2.7 billion, didn\u2019t immediately respond to interview requests made through email or on the voicemail of a mobile phone number he previously provided to an Associated Press reporter.Gawker reacted to the reports by saying: \u201cWe trust the appeals court will correct the outsized Florida jury verdict and reaffirm the law that protects a free and critical press, which is more embattled and important than ever.\u201dHogan\u2019s lawyers wouldn\u2019t comment on the Thiel story but praised the judge for denying a new trial and accused Gawker of refusing to accept responsibility for \u201ctheir reprehensible behaviour and method of doing what they call journalism.\u201dLegal experts say there is nothing illegal \u2013 or even unethical \u2013 about someone financing a lawsuit. There are entire companies that invest in contingency claims, usually in product liability, personal injury, patent infringement and copyright cases. It is called \u201clitigation financing.\u201dBut a billionaire doing it out of what may be spite? That\u2019s a little different, experts say.\u201cAs much as this is not at all illegal or unethical, it just smells and feels wrong,\u201d said Scott Greenfield, a New York lawyer who is managing editor of Fault Lines, an online legal magazine. \u201cWhen a rich guy can basically afford to bring down a media outlet, that has horrible social ramifications, even if the particular outfit is one that everybody hates, like Gawker.\u201dGawker is counting on the case to be overturned on appeal and has not said whether it can afford the full $140 million. During the trial, Gawker\u2019s parent company, a collection of websites called Gawker Media, was estimated to be worth $83 million.Earlier this month, Hogan sued Gawker again, saying the website leaked sealed court documents containing a transcript that quoted him making racist remarks. After the National Enquirer published the story, the WWE pro wrestling company severed its ties with Hogan. Gawker denies it leaked the transcript.In legal circles, attorney James Sammataro of Miami said people speculated how Hogan could afford such a large \u201cdream team\u201d of lawyers.Said Miami attorney Richard Wolfe: \u201cIt sounds to me that Hulk Hogan made a smart deal by getting the right guy to finance his lawsuit.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Nickelback, Corb Lund, Randy Bachman among Fire Aid concert actsA little ol\u2019 band from southern Alberta \u2013 you might have heard of them \u2013 is coming home to help the thousands of people affected by the devastating Fort McMurray wildfire.Nickelback is among the dozen or so performers at the Fire Aid Concert, to be held Wednesday, June 29 at Edmonton\u2019s Commonwealth Stadium. Between 40,000 and 45,000 seats will be available.\u201cThe wildfires have affected the entire country. \xa0The devastation, images and stories of the lives shattered by this resonate with everyone; but, perhaps none more so than Albertans,\u201d Nickelback\u2019s Ryan Peake said. \xa0\u201cAlberta is home for us and we\u2019ve never shied from that.\u201cIt\u2019s the least we could do and we are humbled to be a part of this event with so many talented artists. \xa0So many people have answered the call for help already. \xa0This is the least we can do and we hope that our efforts can assist those that need it most,\u201d Peake said.The concert will also feature Blue Rodeo, Corb Lund, Dean Brody, The Rankin Family, Dallas Smith, Brett Kissel, Randy Bachman with The Sadies, Ian Tyson, Alan Doyle and the Beautiful Gypsies, Dear Rouge, and High Valley.Tickets will cost $35, $60 and $99 and .A program is being set up through Ticketmaster that will allow buyers to purchase extra tickets that will then be distributed to Fort McMurray residents.The football stadium concert venue could\xa0accommodate between 40,000 and 45,000 people, an organizer said. None of the performers are being paid and the organizing group is working with donors and sponsors to handle travel and other expenses.All funds raised will go directly to the Fort McMurray United Way. The United Way will work with the various agencies on the ground in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to help the thousands of\xa0affected residents.\u201cOn behalf of my entire community, we\u2019re truly overwhelmed by the support shown to us over the past three weeks,\u201d Diane Shannon, executive director of the Fort McMurray United Way, said, her voice breaking.\u201cToday particularly I\u2019m so grateful and so moved to be here and to know that the proceeds of Fire Aid will have a profound impact on our ability to allocate the resources necessary to rebuild lives and provide hope to many.\u201dThe concert is being planned by members of Alberta\u2019s Fire Aid Organizing Committee, a group of citizens who got together in a Calgary pub a few weeks ago to begin planning the event.Jeff Parry, a Calgary-based concert promoter and producer, was involved in the 2013 southern Alberta flood benefit concert and said Edmonton\u2019s Commonwealth Stadium seemed like an obvious choice for Fire Aid.\u201cThe money is one thing, but bringing communities together\u2026 it\u2019s like your barn\u2019s burned down and everyone is going to go and help fix the barn. You just go do it and get \u2018er done,\u201d Parry said.\xa0LiveNation and several other agencies came on board, and the concert was quickly organized.Co-chairing Fire Aid for Fort McMurray are three Edmonton-based community leaders: Oilers Entertainment Group (OEG) CEO and Vice Chair Bob Nicholson, Edmonton Eskimos Football Club President and CEO Len Rhodes, and Northlands President and CEO Tim Reid. The mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, Melissa Blake, is also a special Honorary Chair.TD Bank Group also joined the Fire Aid effort with a $500,000 donation.Tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate northeastern Alberta earlier this month when a\xa0nearby wildfire took off, sweeping through the community and destroying over 2,400 structures. \xa0A four-day phased voluntary re-entry will begin next week.', 'Obama gives hip hop history lesson after Vietnamese rapper rhymes for himU.S. President Barack Obama completed a three-day trip to Vietnam with a town hall meeting in Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday.As usual, Obama incorporated a question-and-answer session with the young leaders, which led to an impromptu performance by Vietnamese rapper Suboi.After she performed an a cappella verse, Suboi and Obama discussed gender stereotypes in music.The meeting involved about 800 young adults taking part in efforts to strengthen ties between the United States and Southeast Asia.In Vietnam, he met participants in the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.The initiative targets adults under the age of 35 in a variety of educational and cultural exchanges.Obama will shortly fly to Japan as part of a trip that will include the first visit to Hiroshima since the end of World War II by a sitting U.S. president.', u"Steven Sabados returning to TV for first time since husband Chris Hyndman\u2019s deathIt\u2019s been nearly 10 months since Canadians were shocked by the unexpected death of designer and TV personality .While the stylish and gregarious Hyndman continues to be missed by his many fans across the country, no one has suffered more\xa0from the tragic loss than , Hyndman\u2019s husband and partner in life, love and business.\u201cI\u2019m coping,\u201d\xa0Sabados\xa0told \u2018s\xa0Roz Weston when he dropped by\xa0the studio\xa0Tuesday. \u201cEvery day, that\u2019s basically it.

He is battling cancer for a second time in his life, and so when he recently received some bad news about his prognosis, his schoolmates rallied and called in the Avengers.On Monday, the 67-pound teen answered his front door and was shocked at what he saw: Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. and Captain America Chris Evans had not only teamed up, they were with \u201cIron Man\u201d star Gwyneth Paltrow on a mission to lift his spirits.\u201cHey what\u2019s up buddy?\u201d Evans is heard as Wilcox shakes his head, doing a double take in a video taken by Paltrow. \u201cWe were in the neighborhood and thought we\u2019d cruise by.\u201d\u201cHey guys,\u201d says Wilcox, wearing a T-shirt featuring Captain America\u2019s shield.Paltrow, who plays Pepper Potts in the \u201cIron Man\u201d films, hugged Wilcox\u2019s mom, as the other two stars plopped down on the carpeted living room floor.

The film series has kept him going, keeping him distracted as he has undergone chemotherapy and bone marrow treatments during numerous hospital visits.Wilcox was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer at the age of 16. His mother said the cancer may be the result of chemotherapy treatments he underwent to fight a brain tumor at the age of three.He had a bone marrow transplant from his 14-year-old sister in April 2015, but he had a relapse in December of that year. In February, he had to leave school because his immune system was too weak, and last month the family was told the treatments are not working so far and his disease is progressing, his mother said.Thousands of students at Grossmont High School in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon held a rally two weeks ago, chanting \u201cRyan Strong.\u201d Scores were dressed in red, white and blue in honor of his favorite superhero. Then a group of students made a plea on Facebook for the cast of \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d to visit Wilcox.Evans responded within days of the posting with a video message telling Wilcox to \u201cstay strong.\u201dEvans on Monday signed the shield in the portrait of Wilcox dressed as Captain America above his bed.

This is a man whose security forces have been accused of kidnappings and torture, and whose Wikipedia page has an entire section dedicated to accusations of human rights abuses,\u201d the comedian noted, before taking a couple of jabs at the content Kadyrov\u2019s Instagram account.\u201cIt\u2019s not just where he announced that he lost his cat, it\u2019s also where he keeps his 1.8 million followers updated with videos of his workout routine set to the finest European rave music,\u201d said Oliver before going on to describe Kadyrov as \u201ca can of Monster energy drink come to life.\u201dKadyrov\u2019s Instagram account is notorious: at times described as \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201c, his account has everything from pics of him wrestling in the snow and , to cuddling baby animals and posing with assault weapons.\u201cHonestly, I cannot recommend his Instagram account enough,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt almost makes you forget he was once  before executing him\u2026 Almost, but not quite.\u201dThat was a claim by Kadyrov\u2019s defector former bodyguard, Umar S. Israilov, made before  in 2009.Kadyrov was appointed leader of the Chechen Republic by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007.His close ties with Putin were also fodder for Oliver\u2019s jokes \u2013 something that wasn\u2019t all that hard to do given the ubiquity of Putin\u2019s visage on the account.The jabs pushed Kadyrov , in English no less, to hit back at Oliver and attempted to mock him.  Kadyrov posted an image of Oliver, with a Putin T-shirt photoshopped onto him, saying the comedian \u201cgot his wish to appear publicly in a T-shirt with an image of Putin, but not Obama.\u201d He heaped praise on the Russian president and criticized the U.S., accusing President Barack Obama of sparking deadly \u201cnew wars and bloody internal conflicts.\u201d As for his missing cat, he assured his followers that reports of the cat turning up everywhere from Iceland to New Zealand, and even the Oval Office, were false.', u"Liam Gallagher of Oasis goes on Twitter rant about brother, reunion rumoursIf you were hopeful about those rumours that British band Oasis is reuniting, then we have some bad news for you: they are not.Any lingering faith in seeing Oasis back onstage together was ostensibly  when Liam Gallagher took to Twitter in an expletive-filled rant.Brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher fronted the popular \u201990s band, which had hits like  and .Noel, who was always perceived as the more \u201clevel-headed\u201d brother, apparently wasn\u2019t very resistant to the idea of a reunion; it was allegedly Liam who refused. Either way, the boys aren\u2019t getting back together unless there\u2019s money involved.\u201cNobody has made us an offer. I\u2019ve been in the same room as Liam, and even then nobody\u2019s said, \u2018Weren\u2019t Oasis great? You should re-form,'\u201d Noel\xa0told British publication . \u201cBut if I was ever going to do it, it would only be for the money. This isn\u2019t me putting it out there, by the way. Would I do it for charity? No way. We\u2019re not that kind of people. But would we get back together one day? As long as everybody is still alive and still has their hair, it\u2019s always a possibility. But only for the money.\u201dIt seems even this scenario is unlikely, given Liam\u2019s Twitter rant; he started by calling his brother a potato \u2014 twice.He kind of stops making sense here, but it keeps going on.And in case he wasn\u2019t clear, he ends with a resounding, definitive statement.So we\u2019re pretty certain we won\u2019t be hearing any Oasis reunion music any time soon.

Such testimony from law enforcement officers is common practice at preliminary hearings in Pennsylvania, which have a far lower burden of proof than trials.In her statement, she said Cosby told her the pills were herbal medication. She said he also urged her to sip wine even though she said had not eaten and didn\u2019t want to drink. Constand said her legs felt \u201crubbery\u201d and \u201clike jelly.\u201d \u201dEverything was blurry and dizzy. I felt nauseous,\u201d she said.Constand told detectives that Cosby positioned himself behind her after telling her to lie down on the couch. She said she awoke with her bra askew and did not remember undoing it.In excerpts read in court from his own statement to police in 2005, a seemingly relaxed Cosby said he and Constand had had other \u201cpetting\u201d sessions before.Cosby also told police the pills were over-the-counter Benadryl that he takes to help him sleep. He said he gave Constand one and a half pills and she did not ask what they were.During Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Cosby attorney Brian McMonagle questioned why Constand continued to see the comedian and even returned to the house to meet with him after the alleged assault.\xa0\u201c\t\t\t\n\t\tDetective Katherine Hart testified that Constand told detectives in 2005 that she went back to Cosby\u2019s home to confront him about what had happened.Constand also told detectives she contacted Cosby after moving to Canada because she wanted tickets to one of his comedy shows. McMonagle said Constand brought a present for Cosby.Earlier Tuesday, the comedian walked into the courthouse on the arm of an aide, waving to people waiting outside. He looked healthier than he did when he was charged in December, and was not carrying a cane this time.Prosecutors reopened the case last year after dozens of women levelled similar allegations and after Cosby\u2019s sealed deposition in Constand\u2019s lawsuit was made public.He settled her lawsuit for an undisclosed sum in 2006 after testifying about his extramarital affairs, his use of quaaludes to seduce women and his efforts to hide payments to former lovers from his wife.The testimony and the barrage of allegations have all but destroyed Cosby\u2019s nice-guy image from TV\u2019s \u201cCosby Show.\u201dCosby\u2019s lawyers are trying to get the case thrown out, arguing that a previous prosecutor a decade ago made a binding promise that the comic would never be charged. On Monday, Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court rejected a request to delay the preliminary hearing while Cosby pursues a dismissal.Cosby has not entered a plea since his Dec. 30 arrest. He is free on $1 million bail.He is also fighting defamation lawsuits across the country for allegedly branding his accusers liars and is trying to get his homeowner insurance to pay his legal bills.', u"Gord Downie and The Tragically Hip: Honouring the Canadian band\u2019s best musicOn Tuesday morning, right after celebrating Victoria Day, Canadian rock music fans received some terrible news: Gord Downie, the lead singer for The Tragically Hip, has been .Downie, 52, is beloved from coast to coast, known for his energetic onstage performances and true dedication to Canada. Anyone who\u2019s ever been to a Hip concert can attest to the vibe of the crowd. Arguably, The Hip is\xa0the most \u201cCanadian\u201d band out there, with\xa0Canadianisms peppered throughout their music and\xa0countless references to Canadian locales.Even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agrees with that assessment.Downie and the other members of the band \u2014 Paul Langlois, Rob Baker, Gord Sinclair and Johnny Fay \u2014 are planning a 2016 farewell summer tour to honour Downie and the band\u2019s legacy.Here\u2019s a selection of Downie\u2019s lyrics, illustrating his love for Canada. (Note: these barely scratch the surface, there are so many.)While Downie\u2019s diagnosis is a sad thing, The Hip has created some of the country\u2019s best rock tunes, and we\u2019re choosing to celebrate the band for all that it\u2019s given to music.Break out your Canadian flags, because we\u2019ve put together a Spotify Tragically Hip playlist for all the fans out there:Toronto\u2019s  started the hashtag \u201c#GordIsGreat,\u201d and fans have been replying to that on Twitter with their favourite Hip songs. The radio station is taking Tragically Hip requests all day Tuesday.\u201cMy favourite Tragically Hip song is . It\u2019s clean, easygoing and its effortless groove rolls on like stream water over rocks.\xa0 It feels like Canada.\u201d\u201cThe first thing that sticks out in my mind when it comes to The Hip, putting aside what a kind, funny, interesting and intelligent man Gord is \u2026 is the song .I had just started playing it at around\xa06 p.m. on Feb. 27\xa02010, right at the very second Sidney Crosby scored the overtime winner in the gold medal game of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic hockey tournament. Moments later, thousands of people spilled out into the streets and celebrated at Yonge Dundas Square. I loved that moment so much and that song will forever be linked to it in my mind, a song about a goal everyone remembers as the new goal everyone remembers was happening. It felt serendipitous.\u2018..We all squeezed the stick and we all pulled the trigger\u2026'\u201d\u201cMy song is . As you may know, I ran away from home a couple of years ago. In what ended up being a bout of clinical depression (which I didn\u2019t realize at the time), I quit my job and my relationship. I had 600 songs on my beat up iPhone 4, one of which was .I couldn\u2019t listen to the song because it made me homesick. It brought me back to Canada, to my family, to my friends. To campfires and cannonballs and long prairie drives. One night  came on shuffle while the phone was hooked up to a crappy speaker. I was in India, and earlier that night I was feeding children who literally lived in potato sacks in the street. I was burnt out, and broke. I had been robbed twice that month. \xa0I had met a girl from Belgium who immediately tried to change the song.\u2018Not the song with the birds! She\u2019s going to cry and talk about Canada for the next hour!\u2019 she said. \u2018IT\u2019S A LOON!\u2019 I said. \u2018AND CANADA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD!\u2019I did cry, but they\xa0were happy tears, because there was a time when I never thought it would happen, but I realized it was time for me to go home.\u201d\u201cMy favourite memory of Gord and The Tragically Hip would be when they performed in The Wolf\u2019s backyard with Big Music Fest in Bobcaygeon in June of 2011. The sun went down and  lit up to the sweet sound of  in Bobcaygeon, Ontario.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve worked in rock radio for nearly 15 years, but more importantly have been a die-hard fan of The Tragically Hip for as long as I\u2019ve been listening to music. The Hip were always one of those bands that my brothers and I agreed upon. We\u2019d pack the car with our tent and \u201cadventure kit\u201d and drive to Barrie or wherever they were playing that summer, and rejoice in knowing every single song in the set list, let alone on the CD player. It was almost a religion to our core group of friends. I know people who have seen The Hip over a hundred times.It\u2019s so bittersweet knowing it will most certainly be their last album. Millions of fans around the world are reeling with sadness, but being a member of the media as well as The Tragically Hip\u2019s worldwide fan club, I feel the need to celebrate. To not dwell on the future, but to live in the moment, and celebrate a career and soundtrack to some of the most personal and poignant songs I have ever known. I finally got to meet Gord Downie during the last tour for . I told him how much I loved the new record, and that made him smile. Gord seems to be a pretty serious guy, but watching him on stage that night, it was if there was a natural connection between he and his fans, an understanding that this is what he was meant to be. A performer. A ringleader. Someone to be loved by the masses. That\u2019s what chokes me up. The fact that I might not have the chance to witness that ever again in this lifetime. That being said, I will do my best to get online and buy tickets for one of those shows. Hopefully I\u2019ll get to witness the spectacle once more. If not, I have plenty of amazing memories that I will cherish forever.My favourite songs are , , , , and .\u201d Q107\u2019s John Derringer weighs in on Gord Downie\u2019s cancer diagnosis\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t", u'Tragically Hip fans share lyrics, messages of hope after Gord Downie cancer diagnosisFans of Canadian rock legend Gord Downie and The Tragically Hip took to social media Tuesday to share messages of heartbreak, admiration and hope after the band revealed Downie was diagnosed with terminal brain caner in December.In a letter addressed to fans, the band said their frontman\xa0has been fighting hard over the last few months with friends and family by his side.

It is the largest hot spring in the United States and features rainbow coloured rings around its edge thanks to its unique ecosystem.However, it is strictly prohibited for tourists to leave the boardwalk surrounding the Grand Prismatic Spring \u2013 a rule clearly marked by signs throughout the park.\u201cThe individuals approached the spring and took several photos or videos of themselves with an array of cameras,\u201d read court documents .\u201cThe individuals also can be seen reaching into the spring. The nearest boardwalk is approximately 25 yards from where they are located.\u201dAccording to the court documents, three of the four  members face two criminal complaints.

It was the wrong decision to make.\u201dAccording to the apology, the group plans to donate $5,000 to Yellowstone National Park. The post does not make mention of any criminal charges.Global News reached out to the  crew for additional comment, but received no response.The website, where the vloggers sell their clothing line, has since gone offline.However, this isn\u2019t the first time the group has come under fire.According to posts compiled by an Imgur user, .

Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways. He was a master storyteller, a gentleman and a wonderful friend. We will miss him very much,\u201d said Jeff Fager, the executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201dSafer did 919 stories in his 46 years on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d from his first in 1970 about U.S. Sky Marshals to his last this March, a profile of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels.\u201cMorley was one of the most important journalists in any medium, ever,\u201d said CBS Chairman and CEO, Leslie Moonves. \u201cHe broke ground in war reporting and made a name that will forever be synonymous with \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d He was also a gentleman, a scholar, a great raconteur.\u201dIn 1970, Safer joined \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d then just two years old and not yet the national institution it would become. He claimed the co-host chair alongside Mike Wallace.During the next four decades, his rich tobacco-and-whiskey voice delivered stories that ranged from art, music and popular culture, to \u201cgotcha\u201d investigations, to one of his favourite pieces, which, in 1983, resulted in the release from prison of Lenell Geter, an engineer wrongly convicted of a $50 holdup at a fast food restaurant who had been sentenced to a life term.A memorable 1984 profile of Jackie Gleason took place in a bar around a pool table, where \u201cthe Great One\u201d showed Safer and his viewers how it\u2019s done.A pair of essays in the 1990s \u2014 \u201cYes, But Is It Art?\u201d \u2014 examined the relative merits of representational and abstract art.A 1991 story close to Safer\u2019s heart reported a not-yet-popular view among some medical experts that regular consumption of red wine can be good for one\u2019s health. As with many \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories, this piece had an immediate impact: Dropping by his neighbourhood liquor store the day after it aired, Safer learned there had been a rush on red wine.And in 2011, he scored a coup: a sit-down with Ruth Madoff, offering her first public description of the day she learned from her husband, Bernard, that he was running the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.Safer won a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for his 2001 story on a school in Arizona specifically geared to serve children who are homeless.Other honours include three George Foster Peabody awards, 12 Emmys and two George Polk Memorial Awards.Safer was born in Toronto in 1931, yet nonetheless insisted he was \u201cstateless\u201d and, as a reporter chasing stories around the globe, claimed, \u201cI have no vested interests.\u201d He eventually became an American citizen, holding dual citizenship.He began his career at several news organizations in Canada and England before being hired by Reuters wire service in its London bureau. Then, in 1955, he was offered a correspondent\u2019s job in the Canadian Broadcasting Company\u2019s London bureau, where he worked nine years before CBS News hired him for its London bureau.In 1965 he opened CBS\u2019 Saigon bureau.That August, \u201cThe CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\u201d aired a report by Safer that rocked viewers, who, at that point, remained mostly supportive of the war effort in Vietnam. Safer had been invited to join a group of Marines on what a lieutenant described as a search-and-destroy mission in the tiny villages that made up Cam Ne.But what he encountered there, and captured on film, was the spectacle of American soldiers employing their Zippo lighters to burn the thatched-roof, mud-plastered huts to the ground, despite having encountered no resistance from village residents.Safer\u2019s expose ignited a firestorm.President Johnson gave CBS President Frank Stanton a tongue-lashing and suggested that Safer had \u201cCommunist ties\u201d and had staged the entire story. Safer feared for his safety in the company of angry U.S. soldiers.\u201cThe Cam Ne story was broadcast over and over again in the United States and overseas. It was seized upon by Hanoi as a propaganda tool and by scoundrels of the left and right, in the Pentagon and on campuses,\u201d Safer wrote in his 1990 memoir, \u201cFlashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam.\u201dSafer served two tours in Vietnam, then, in 1967, began three years as London bureau chief.In 1970, he was brought to New York to succeed original co-host Harry Reasoner on an innovative newsmagazine that, in its third season, was still struggling in the ratings, and would rely on Safer and Wallace as its only co-anchors for the next five years.In 1971, Safer won an Emmy for his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d investigation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began America\u2019s war in Vietnam.He became a fixture at \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 and part of that show\u2019s rough-and-tumble behind-the-scenes culture. (A former producer for Safer kept on display a framed remnant of the curtain that was the landing place for a cup of coffee Safer once threw at him.)By 2006 Safer had reduced his output. But he remained with the show after the departures of Wallace \u2014 who retired in 2006 at age 88, and died in 2012 \u2014 as well as legendary \u201c60 Minutes\u201d creator-producer, Don Hewitt \u2014 who stepped down in 2004 at 81, and died in 2009.And as late as 2012, he still held forth daily in his office on West 57th Street, where he banged out \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories as he had done for more than 40 years.He is survived by his wife, the former Jane Fearer, and his daughter Sarah.', u'Justin Trudeau grilled on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 about Syrian refugeesHours before Prime Minister \u2018s now-famous , he was shooting a segment for satirical newsmagazine\xa0about Canadian \u201cniceness\u201d and the government\u2019s policy regarding Syrian refugees.In an example of eerie foreshadowing, segment host Hasan Minhaj asks Trudeau \u201cAre you going to kick my ass right now?\u201d right off the top.Trudeau laughs it off, and the two venture into a discussion about the possibility that incoming Syrian refugees might actually be terrorists.\xa0The Canadian prime minister\xa0went on to explain that Canada thrives only by expanding its population and adding to its culture; instead of making the \u201ccircle smaller and smaller,\u201d he believes marginalizing groups of people is what ultimately leads to danger.', u'Claim Prince is your father? Be ready to give some bloodMINNEAPOLIS \u2013 When Prince died suddenly in April, he left behind no known children. That has his sibling and half siblings lining up in probate court for their shares of a fortune certain to run into the millions, with great earning potential. Yet it\u2019s still possible that an unknown heir may emerge. A Colorado prison inmate has already filed a paternity claim, and the Minnesota court overseeing Prince\u2019s estate has set up a process to vet that and any others. Some questions and answers on paternity claims in Minnesota:Prince had only one known child, a boy who died in 1996 a week after birth. To test the claim of anyone who comes forward now, Carver County District Judge Kevin Eide has authorized genetic testing on a sample of Prince\u2019s blood now held by the medical examiner\u2019s office. Eide also granted a request from Bremer Trust, the special administrator overseeing the estate, to let Bremer set up the protocol for exactly how to handle claimants. Bremer proposed that those people submit affidavits backing up their relationship to Prince, and then agree to blood and genetic testing \u2014 at their expense.A court cannot absolutely confirm paternity, but works to establish what\u2019s known as a probability of paternity.DNA Diagnostics Center, the company the estate special administrator has proposed using, says on its website that it tests for at least 16 DNA markers in father and child to produce genetic profiles for each person, and then uses statistical analysis to calculate probability of paternity. The company claims accuracy of as much as 99.999 per cent.Such a test would likely be preceded by screening questions such as whether Prince and the alleged mother spent time together, or whether they and the alleged child shared a similar blood type, said Judith T. Younger, a University of Minnesota law professor who isn\u2019t involved in the case. She said all the evidence would lead to a calculation of how likely it is that a claimant is Prince\u2019s biological heir.\u201cThe key to understanding it is when you\u2019re testing for paternity, what you\u2019re getting is not a fact, but a probability. And that\u2019s the best that we seem able to do now,\u201d Younger said.Judge Eide set a four-month deadline for claims against the estate, which would be early September. Younger said that\u2019s a fairly typical window. Claimants who file after that might be accepted, she said, but courts typically adhere to the rules laid out. \u201cI think the court has the power always to make exceptions,\u201d Younger said. She added that any tests should be done fairly quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a test that can\u2019t be done quite rapidly,\u201d she said.A person with a verified claim to be Prince\u2019s child would zoom to the front of the line for his estate. In fact, a child would get it all under Minnesota law. So nothing would go to Prince\u2019s sister Tyka Nelson and his five half siblings, said Susan Link, head of estate planning for the Minneapolis-based Maslon law firm. \u201cA child would trump the siblings,\u201d Link said. Carlin Q. Williams, the Colorado prison inmate, is the only person so far with a claim pending. His mother, Marsha Henson, contends that she conceived Williams while having sex with Prince at a Kansas City, Missouri, hotel in July 1976. Williams has asked Judge Eide to require the special administrator to first test people who claim to be Prince\u2019s children, and to refrain from testing anyone claiming a more distant relationship until the first tests are completed and reported. He argues that testing such claims would be a waste of time and money if a child of Prince\u2019s is confirmed.Two claims have come from a woman and a minor claiming to be niece and grandniece to Prince by virtue of their connection to Duane Nelson Sr., widely described as Prince\u2019s late half brother. Nelson, who died in 2011, is not listed as a relative in papers filed by Tyka Nelson\u2019s lawyers in the probate case. Her lawyers have declined to clarify why not, citing attorney-client confidentiality. If Nelson\u2019s daughter and granddaughter are proven blood heirs, they could stand to inherit his share of the estate along with the surviving siblings.A Kansas City woman has also claimed to be a half sister.___Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski and Doug Glass contributed.', u'Drake, Alessia Cara lead with 7 nominations apiece at iHeartRadio Canada MMVAsTORONTO \u2014 Drake and Alessia Cara are leading the pack heading into the iHeartRadio Canada MuchMusic Video Awards next month.The Toronto rapper and the Brampton, Ont., pop sensation are tied with seven nominations apiece, including nods for video of the year for Drake\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling\u201d and Cara\u2019s \u201cHere.\u201dCara is also nominated in the newly created best new Canadian artist category, alongside Coleman Hell, Dan Talevski, Jazz Cartier and Ria Mae.Last year\u2019s four-time winner the Weeknd will have the chance to add to his trophy haul.The Toronto R&B hitmaker \u2013 whose real name is Abel Tesfaye \u2013 is tied with singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes for six nominations apiece.First time nominees include former One Direction member turned solo star Zayn, DJ duo The Chainsmokers, Haitian-Canadian musician Kaytranada and indie rock group The Strumbellas.American supermodel Gigi Hadid will be hosting this year\u2019s telecast on June 19 alongside Much personalities Liz Trinnear and Tyrone Edwards.', u"Second \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 trailer: Studio avoids YouTube, movie still gets backlash\u2018s all-female  remake just can\u2019t catch a break.Sony Pictures, the studio behind the film, opted to  on Wednesday instead of YouTube, after commenters made the first \xa0preview\xa0the  in the video site\u2019s history.It didn\u2019t really make a difference, with naysayers filling social media sites with vitriol about the remake.A few people bucked the trend and tweeted their support for the new film.There are many new things to notice (and enjoy) in the second trailer, including Slimer, the little green ghost from the original film.

You\u2019ve seen me in movies, you know what I looked like. I was a total idiot,\u201d Hanks, 59, said when talking about managing his health and lifestyle.It was in 2013 that Hanks first publicly talked about developing Type 2 diabetes, according to U.S. reports.\u201cI went to the doctor and he said, \u2018You know those high blood sugar numbers you\u2019ve been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you\u2019ve graduated, you\u2019ve got Type 2 diabetes, young man,\u2019\u201d he told then- host David Letterman.Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease in which your pancreas doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin, or your body doesn\u2019t properly use the insulin it makes, according to the . As a result, sugar builds up in your blood instead of being used for energy.Dr. Ron Goldenberg, an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes care at North York General Hospital, says some factors, such as genetics, family history and a predisposition, are out of our hands, but there are ways to delay and even prevent the worsening of the disease.\u201cWhile Tom Hanks is correct in saying he could have kept this off, you may still get it if you\u2019re predisposed. Some people get it despite their best efforts,\u201d Goldenberg told Global News.\u201cBut you can delay the onset, sometimes you may even prevent it and once you get it you can improve [your situation]. There have been cases where people have reversed their Type 2 diabetes,\u201d he explained.The progression varies from person to person: some people could be prediabetic then develop diabetes within a rapid timeframe of about two to three years while others could have the disease slowly progress for years or even decades.The guide to stalling or preventing diabetes is nearly identical to its treatment. Here are four ways you can try to keep Type 2 diabetes at bay: Goldenberg says Type 2 diabetes is \u201cdefinitely\u201d linked to obesity. About 80 to 90 per cent of people with the condition are obese, he says.\u201cAs the obesity epidemic increases, so does the epidemic of Type 2 diabetes. Once you\u2019re diagnosed, one of the important aspects is weight loss,\u201d he said.A modest weight loss of about five to 10 pounds can \u201cdramatically improve\u201d blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and blood pressure \u2013 all risk factors tied to diabetes, heart disease and hypertension.Being obese makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes compared to someone with a healthy weight. Losing up to 10 per cent of your current weight could cut chances of developing diabetes in half, though.Aim for about 30 minutes of physical activity daily, Goldenberg suggests. And when it comes to eating, try to shave off about 500 calories per day. That tactic alone could help you lose about a pound a week.The Harvard School of Public Health  a diet rich in whole grains and fibre.\u201cWhole grains don\u2019t contain a magical nutrient that fights diabetes and improves health. It\u2019s the entire package,\u201d the researchers explain.The bran and fibre in whole grains make it difficult for our body\u2019s enzymes to break down the starches into glucose. This leads to a lower, slower increase in blood sugar and insulin.On the other end of the spectrum, try to avoid simple sugars and refined carbohydrates. Those will get converted into glucose quickly.Trans fats should also be traded in for mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Load up on nuts, poultry, and fish, too.Losing five per cent of body weight, following a healthy diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes a day can make you 60 per cent less likely to go on to develop diabetes. Stress isn\u2019t a direct cause of diabetes but it can \u201cmagnify\u201d the situation, especially if you\u2019re predisposed to the disease, Goldenberg says.That\u2019s because your stress hormones, such as cortisol, can tamper with blood glucose levels. It\u2019s not an underlying factor but reducing stress won\u2019t work against you.Make sure you\u2019re sleeping enough, too. Insufficient sleep could put your long-term health at risk. There are a handful of signs and symptoms that could signal the precursor to diabetes.Goldenberg said a primary concern is excess weight around the waist. Another concern is your fasting glucose levels, which your doctor can test for.The CDA says unusual thirst, frequent urination, weight gain, extreme fatigue or lack of energy and blurred vision are also red flags you should ask your doctor about.carmen.chai@globalnews.ca', u'Michael Bubl\xe9 needs vocal cord surgery, bows out of upcoming events has  to announce that he has to have vocal cord surgery, and as a result of the recovery time, will be bowing out of some upcoming performances.The Canadian crooner said that he\u2019s \u201cespecially sorry\u201d to be missing the Canadian Governor General Performance Arts Award Gala, where he was supposed to be honoured, and the Marvin Gaye Tribute at the Kennedy Center in June.Bubl\xe9 will now be honoured a year later at the gala\u2019s 25th anniversary on June 29, 2017.\u201cWe look forward to welcoming him to Ottawa with his family in 2017 to receive the NAC Award,\u201d\xa0Peter\xa0Herrndorf, the president and CEO of the National Arts Centre, said\xa0in a statement.Typically, a vocal cord surgery patient cannot talk \u2014 or even whisper \u2014 let alone sing for  post-surgery.

His interest in music was inspired by his father\u2019s law partner, and most of the first songs he learned to sing and play were in Spanish.He moved to Houston in the 1960s, where he met Van Zandt and several other folk songwriters and played in coffee shops and bars. He married his first wife, Susan Spaw, and they had a son, Travis, in 1966. After his split with Susan, he met painter Susanna Talley and they moved to Los Angeles to pursue his music career.His dissatisfaction with the city\u2019s hectic lifestyle was the basis of his song , which was recorded by Walker on his debut album. He and Susanna moved to Nashville in 1971. His success as a songwriter led to a recording contract with RCA, and he released his first album, , in 1975. The album included songs like  and , which Cash also recorded.\u201cThe only songs I have gotten cut were the ones I wrote for myself to sing,\u201d Clark said in an interview with The Associated Press in 2013. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even think about the radio. Or think about other artists doing them. So I just quit wasting my time thinking about it. Because the best work always comes from writing for yourself and writing stuff you know about, rather than, \u2018What would George Jones like?\u2019 or \u2018What would George Strait like?'\u201dHis home became a musical haven for songwriters, singers and artists, and his house was full of demo tapes of songs and Susanna\u2019s paintings and artwork. He was close friends with many of Nashville\u2019s talented musicians, including Steve Earle, Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Shawn Camp and Sarah Jarosz.His songs were very detailed, literary and full of imagery, such as \u201cThe Randall Knife,\u201d about the knife his father carried with him through World War II. A tribute album to Clark, \u201cThis One\u2019s for Him,\u201d which featured recordings by Rosanne Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and John Prine, won album of the year at the Americana Music Association\u2019s Honors and Awards in 2012.Clark received the Poet\u2019s Award from the Academy of Country Music in 2012. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriter\u2019s Hall of Fame that same year.\u201cI am glad that I raised the bar to some extent, if in fact I did, but, I mean, you can\u2019t live on that every day,\u201d Clark said in 2013. \u201cYou have to reinvent yourself the next day. You have to write as good and continue to do so. And that gets harder.\u201dHe recorded several albums, although he never achieved the same success as a performer, but he was beloved in the folk and Americana musical community. His final album, \u201cMy Favorite Picture of You,\u201d won a Grammy in 2014 for best folk album. The title song was inspired by his wife, who died in 2012 and who is featured on the album\u2019s cover. The picture shows a frustrated Susanna, her arms crossed and a glare on her face.\u201cTownes (Van Zandt) and I were in that house that she is in front of and we were drunk, drunk, just obnoxiously drunk,\u201d Clark said during a 2013 interview with the AP. \u201cAnd she had just had enough.\u201dHe is survived by his son Travis and daughter-in-law Krista McMurtry Clark; grandchildren Dylan and Ellie Clark; sisters Caroline Clark Dugan and Jan Clark. Funeral arrangements are pending.He was 74 and had been in poor health, although Case didn\u2019t give an official cause of death.A native of Monahans, Texas, Clark was known for such hits as  and , and his songs were covered by Johnny Cash, Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs and many others.In 2014, his  won a Grammy for best folk album.Clark also was a mentor for such future stars as Steve Earle and Rodney Crowell.", u'Sinead O\u2019Connor writes vulgar, angry Facebook letter after going missingShortly after Sinead O\u2019Connor , she took to her  and \xa0titled \u201cOpen Letter to John Reynolds.\u201dReynolds is the first husband of O\u2019Connor, and they have one child together, Jake, who is also referenced in the letter.Among many accusations, she says she was \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cleft to die\u201d by the pair\xa0for being mentally ill and suicidal.The latter part of the letter says she\u2019ll \u201csee [them] all in court.

Her sly subversions of her fame \u2014 playing characters that exist just outside the real-life spotlight always fixed on her \u2014 follow her award-winning role as a famous actress\u2019s personal assistant in Assayas\u2019 .In the mysterious , her character buys designer clothes and jewelry for a star, while mourning her late twin brother, with whom she believes she can communicate spiritually. On Tuesday, Stewart discussed fame as a constraint that can immobilize her.Cannes has been a valuable place for Stewart to explore new, more adventurous avenues for herself, and she has been a common, much-photographed presence throughout this year\u2019s festival. She has at turns welcomed the notoriety \u2014 dancing on the red carpet premiere of Andrea Arnold\u2019s  \u2014 and sought to evade it.Summoning the fright of her character in , she said, needed no communion with the supernatural.\u201cThe constant nature of life is so terrifying,\u201d she said, under press-conference lights. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away from it. Like right now, I can\u2019t get out. I can\u2019t get out of here! I cannot get out of right here.\u201d is a shifty, enigmatic film that drew mixed reviews from critics. Booing has a long tradition at Cannes where many jeered or divisive films have gone on to become well-regarded.Asked about the booing, Assayas (, ) said he accepted that \u201cmovies have a life of their own\u201d and that Cannes, in all its feverish intensity, is \u201cthe extreme version of that.\u201dThe 26-year-old Stewart voiced her strong support for the director.\u201cThere\u2019s a flame that he lights under my ass that is stronger than I have ever felt,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cI really try to navigate my career by feel. I just feel him.\u201dStewart was particularly forthcoming about the challenges of the film (\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the hell I was doing ever,\u201d she said) and how she sought to be \u201cthe most thoughtless, present, naked version of myself I could possibly be.\u201d It was a vindicating experience, said the actress.\u201cThis movie made me feel like there\u2019s nothing that I can put myself through that will ever actually make me not be able to keep going,\u201d she said.In Allen\u2019s , Stewart plays the assistant to a powerful Hollywood agent (Steve Carell) who\u2019s drawn to the larger-than-life figures of the movies. But in one scene, Stewart seems to be commenting on her own place in the industry: \u201cI think I\u2019d be happier being life-size,\u201d she tells the visiting out-of-towner, played by Jesse Eisenberg.Asked whether she connected with her character\u2019s mysticism in , Stewart pondered it.\u201cDo I believe in ghosts? I don\u2019t know, I guess I believe in something,\u201d she said.

I hope those homosexuals do threaten the state.

Last year\u2019s contest reached nearly 200 million viewers globally.Amid entries about love and desire, Jamala\u2019s song stood out. With sombre lyrics it recalls how Crimean Tatars, including her great-grandmother, were deported in 1944 by Soviet authorities during World War II. Many died during the deportations or starved to death on the barren steppes of central Asia. Decades later some of the survivors were allowed to return to the Crimean Peninsula.Jamala delivered an emotional performance, her voice soaring as the song built up force from a quiet start.\u201cI was sure that if you sing, if you talk about truth, it really can touch people,\u201d she told reporters after the competition.The focus on Crimea, whose annexation by Russia in 2014 was opposed by its Tatar minority, could be considered a swipe at Moscow, but Jamala insisted there was no political subtext, and contest officials agreed.The rules of the glitzy competition prohibit political statements.Im, who was born in South Korea and is a former Australian \u201cX Factor\u201d talent show winner, was in the lead following a count of the jury votes, but her song \u201cSound of Silence\u201d was bumped down to second place when the popular vote was added.Though Australia is far from Europe, the Eurovision show is hugely popular Down Under where it has been broadcast for more than 30 years. Australia was invited to compete for the second consecutive year.The annual contest, which started in 1956, is known for its eclectic mix of rock ballads, techno-pop and occasional folkloric tunes. However, in recent years entries have moved away from ethnic influences toward more mainstream dance music.All but one of the 26 entries in the final were performed entirely or partially in English.The stage production is also getting increasingly elaborate, with pyrotechnics and computer graphics compensating for bland tunes with cheesy lyrics.Lazarev\u2019s club anthem \u201cYou Are the Only One\u201d had the most striking visual effects. At one point the black-clad Russian scaled a LED display and rode a virtual iceberg through space.Some Russian fans accused the judges of political bias, noting that Lazarev got the highest score in the popular vote.\u201cI\u2019m so sad,\u201d said Dennis Kalinkin, a 29-year-old Russian who lives in France.Bulgaria placed fourth, ahead of host nation Sweden.

Her bosses apologized and Ripa, upon her return, said the incident opened a conversation about workplace respect. Strahan had been on the show since September 2012, when he replaced Regis Philbin.ABC had initially said Strahan was to work with Ripa for the rest of the summer, but moved his exit to Friday when the transition was fumbled.The show now starts an extended period of guest hosts with Ripa, some auditioning to be Strahan\u2019s permanent replacement.As she sipped from a  mug on Friday, Ripa wryly noted that there will be a run on such merchandise.\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d Strahan said. \u201cOf course, you get nervous like this. This is a moment I didn\u2019t anticipate being here at this point. But it\u2019s here, and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201dHe said he\u2019ll remain \u201cin the family.\u201d , which is counting on Strahan\u2019s sunny personality to reverse fading ratings, is broadcast right before  in much of the country.But he became wide-eyed when Ripa suggested that he guest-host for her when she goes on vacation in a couple of weeks.\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they say \u2018too soon?\u2019 Yes.\u201dWith Strahan saying he wanted a low-key send-off, they moved swiftly into the show\u2019s fluffy host chat segment. Ripa recounted seeing New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez in a bar the previous night and told about a hotel stay where the toilet was so tall her feet dangled when she sat.Actor Matt Bomer was a guest, praising Strahan for his \u201cgreat intelligence and grace and generosity,\u201d while also noting Ripa looked better than he had ever seen her.

In other cases, like , shows are on for several seasons and their cancellations are more of a natural development. After all, there are only so many stories to tell.Many popular TV shows faced the axe last night as networks announced which ones wouldn\u2019t be renewed. Here\u2019s a list of the shows you\u2019re going to have to say goodbye to. This widely loved country-music drama was spinning its wheels a little bit, but ratings were still on the rise. Strange, then, that ABC pulled the plug at this juncture. The series finale will air on Wednesday, May 25. This is less surprising, in that the new, edgier Muppets never really caught on with the TV audience. It tried to retool itself midway through its run, but sadly it never picked up the anticipated audience. This franchise may lend itself better to movies. After eight seasons, even fans knew this one was coming. Once lead Stana Katic walked away, it was pretty clear the show was nearing its end. This is an emotional one, for sure.\xa0\xa0now has the ugly distinction of being the first Marvel live-action series to be cancelled. Even though most critics and fans knew this was coming, it doesn\u2019t hurt any less.\xa0Even John Stamos and his ridiculous good looks couldn\u2019t save this show.\xa0With  cancelled, it was assumed that  would survive the cuts since the shows were always promoted as a package deal. Alas, that didn\u2019t end up being the case. Sorry Rob Lowe and Fred Savage. Joan Allen and Zach Gilford () weren\u2019t enough to keep this show afloat. It never really caught on in the first place, so it was fighting a losing battle.\xa0Often derided as the  franchise\u2019s failed attempt to modernize,  wasn\u2019t going to last. Hey, at least it got a couple seasons, right? You\u2019d think a show about an outbreak would thrive in a world paranoid about Zika virus and Ebola, but unfortunately it\u2019s a theme that\u2019s been overdone and overused. That may have been its death knell.On the flip side, a show that was most certainly going to be cancelled, , was renewed. In the U.S., the show is moving from CBS to the CW, and in Canada, it should still be airing on Global. One can argue that it\u2019ll fit in much better with the shows on The CW, like its superhero sister shows\xa0, , and .', u'The Spice Girls are back and making new music (well, 3 of them)Three members of the world\u2019s favourite \u201990s girl band, The Spice Girls, have reunited and are reportedly .Emma Bunton (\u201cBaby\u201d), Melanie Brown (\u201cScary\u201d) and Geri Horner (formerly Halliwell, \u201cGinger\u201d) have been recording new music at London\u2019s Play Deep Studios for the past two days, according to the U.K.\u2019s .The other two spice girls, Victoria Beckham (\u201cPosh\u201d) and Mel C (\u201cSporty\u201d) were not in attendance.

They wanted to \u201cmake certain that the focus of this horrific incident remains on improved patient care and the legacy of Joan Rivers,\u201d attorneys Ben Rubinowitz and Jeff Bloom said in a statement.Melissa Rivers said the settlement allows her to \u201cput the legal aspects of my mother\u2019s death behind me and ensure that those culpable for her death have accepted responsibility for their actions quickly and without equivocation.\u201dShe said in the statement issued by her lawyers that she will continue working to ensure higher safety standards at out-patient surgical clinics.The lawsuit had alleged that doctors at the clinic mishandled Rivers\u2019 endoscopy and performed another procedure, known as a laryngoscopy, on Rivers\u2019 vocal cords without consent. The suit claimed that an anesthesiologist expressed concern over what the procedure would do to Rivers\u2019 ability to breathe, but was told she was being \u201cparanoid\u201d by the gastroenterologist performing the endoscopy.The city\u2019s medical examiner found that Joan Rivers died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during the endoscopy. Her death was classified as a therapeutic complication. The classification is not commonly used; more deaths are certified as accidents, homicides, suicides or natural causes. Negligence was not suspected. Had it been, it would have been listed as a contributing cause.The clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found after an investigation that the clinic made several errors, including failing to keep proper medication records and snapping cellphone photos.The investigation also found that the clinic had failed to receive informed consent for every procedure performed and failed to record Rivers\u2019 weight before administering sedation medication.\xa0', u'Toronto play makes unique appeal to hearing impaired audiencesAt the most basic level, plays are both a visual and auditory medium: you need to see the actors and hear what they\u2019re saying to enjoy the work.Now a new\xa0play, a co-production\xa0by the Toronto-based Theatre Passe Muraille and Cahoots Theatre, is taking that formula and giving it a new twist.Titled \u201cUltrasound\u201d, the play centres around two characters: one is\xa0deaf and one is hard of hearing \u2013 the former speaks only in sign language throughout the play. In order to convey his speech to audience members not familiar with American Sign Language (ASL), lines of dialogue are projected onto the set as the characters interact.Combined with various lighting and sound choices, the play seeks to be accessible to both the deaf and hearing communities.\u201cKnowing that one character signed all of their dialogue and another character \u2013 kind of in the learning phase of ASL \u2013 signed half their dialogue, we recognized that the challenge of this play was not being able to invite deaf audiences, but in fact, being sure that a hearing audience would have access to all the play,\u201d Marjorie Chan, the director of \u201cUltrasound\u201d, told Global News.That led to the creative decision to use \u201csurtitling\u201d, wherein lines of dialogue are projected onto the set or scenery as the actors spoke (or signed) the lines.\u201cYou see it in opera, where it sits above the opera singers. You see it in movies, where\u2019s it\u2019s called captioning,\u201d Chan said. \u201cFor us, we wanted it to not only to just to be perfunctory, but actually part of the way you envision the play.\u201dThe result is a play that challenges the audience perception of a night at the theatre (for those unfamiliar with ASL, there is a fair amount of reading to be done) but can provide some unexpected surprises as well.For instance, the play opens with one character performing an impassioned soliloquy from Shakespeare entirely in sign language, a rather bold declaration that this will be something familiar, presented in a way you\u2019ve maybe not seen before.\u201cUltrasound\u201d is the story of a couple struggling with the consequences and ramifications of having children. Alphonse (played by Chris Dodd) is completely deaf, and staunchly argues that his child-to-be should be deaf as well. His wife Miranda (Elizabeth Morris), an aspiring actress, is only partially deaf, and begins to grow angered by Alphonse\u2019s stubborn attitude and increasingly militant viewpoints.Both Dodd and Morris are members of the deaf community, adding a level of authenticity to the way they communicate on stage. For Morris, the play was an opportunity to speak to members of both the deaf and hearing communities.\u201cNinety per cent of deaf children come from hearing families,\u201d Morris said. \u201cSo I really wanted people to have the opportunity to see what inclusive theatrical productions look like.\u201dThe play represents the debut work from Saskatchewan-born writer Adam Pottle, also a member of the deaf community, who injected plenty of his own background \u2013 a love of death metal, a focus on the local theatre scene and the struggles of the deaf in a hearing world \u2013 into the play\u2019s narrative.\u201cDeaf and disabled people seldom get the chance to share their stories, whether in the theatre, in literature, in film or in television,\u201d Pottle said. \u201cFor two major Canadian theatre companies to throw their weight behind a play like this\xa0constitutes a distinct shift in the artistic landscape, a shift that will hopefully spur other Canadian theatres into exploring these subjects.\u201d\u201c[Pottle] wanted to represent all these communities: the deaf community and the hard of hearing community and the hearing community,\u201d Chan explained. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t want to represent them in a simplistic way or in a way that only spoke to one message.\u201dAccording to Chan, the play has generated an enthusiastic response from deaf and hard of hearing audiences who have seen it.\u201cWe\u2019ve had some very good responses from the deaf community,\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a visual community, a face-to-face community, and so we\u2019re just starting to see the results of that.\u201d\u201cUltrasound\u201d completes its run on stage on May 15.', u'Paris Hilton to produce documentary about her rise to fameAnother  documentary is on its way, but this time it will be produced by the reality star herself.9.14 Pictures is teaming up with Hilton to release a documentary about the 35-year-old\u2019s life.Jamie Freed, executive producer of Paris Hilton\u2019s TV series will be working on the documentary alongside others.XYZ Films will executive produce the untitled documentary and will be in\xa0charge of worldwide sales.Production will begin late this summer in Ibiza.

Other artists performing include Kylie Minogue and Andrea Bocelli.Global News spoke to Clifton Murray about the honour, what songs they\u2019ll be singing, and what the vibe is like in London. Oh, it is. It\u2019s very exciting for me, but probably even more exciting for my mother. [Laughs] It\u2019s so remarkable to be around somebody who has so much influence on the planet. She\u2019s the longest-reigning monarch in history, of any country. She\u2019s also the head of the church that my family\u2019s a part of. It\u2019s so significant. We\u2019re honoured, it\u2019s a \u201cpinch me\u201d moment.There\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re going to meet her. We\u2019ve been invited to a tea \u2014 all the performers have \u2014 which we\u2019ve actually attended in the past, at the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee celebration. It\u2019s mind-blowing for us, since we get to experience a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity again. This invite back is quite special, not only to be celebrating Her Majesty, but also to be representing Canada.Certainly. There are horses everywhere, everyone\u2019s dressed to the nines, it\u2019s very posh. Soldiers and representatives from all over the world, dancers from Fiji, military people \u2026 you feel like you\u2019re in this incredible Narnia.

Everybody is coming to this part of the world, Windsor is packed with tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of the Queen. It\u2019s a time of celebration. She\u2019s linked to the English people, so everyone\u2019s celebrating. The rain isn\u2019t getting anyone down, they\u2019re jolly in spite of it all.We have three sections and four shows. Each show will have representatives of the royal family, and then on the fourth night, Her Majesty will be in attendance. So we have three nights to get it right, before she shows up. [Laughs] We\u2019ll be opening up the show with two of our songs, including Leonard Cohen\u2019s .A little bit later on, there\u2019s a Canadian section of the show when we\u2019ll be singing ; we\u2019ve created a four-part arrangement and a big orchestral. We will be performing Andrea Bocelli\u2019s  from , too.Sure. We\u2019re just doing it better. [Laughs] No, but seriously, every night is special for us.

According to  film reporter Ramin Setoodeh, Allen said he wasn\u2019t offended by the joke to a table of Cannes attendees, which included some media.Allen is notorious for not reading any articles about himself, especially those that address his alleged sexual abuse crimes, so it\u2019s no surprise that the director claims  his son\u2019s \xa0piece.\u201cI never read anything about me,\u201d Allen said to . \u201cAny of these interviews I do, anything.

[u'Where Obama and his family will live after they leave the White HouseWASHINGTON \u2013 Real estate circles are buzzing over reports that President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have decided to lease a nine-bedroom mansion in one of Washington\u2019s poshest neighbourhoods when he leaves office in January.With a sprawling terrace and a castle-like exterior, the home sits on a quarter-acre lot just down the road from the Naval Observatory, the vice-president\u2019s official residence, in the wealthy Kalorama neighbourhood near Embassy Row. A 2011 remodel brought the total number of bathrooms to eight-and-a-half, along with three fireplaces and an \u201cau pair suite,\u201d spread out over roughly 8,200 square feet, according to real estate data. It features parking for up to 10 cars.Peg Mancuso, the president of the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors, called the area \u201cclearly one of the best neighbourhoods in the Washington Metropolitan area.\u201d She said if the reports are true, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have picked a better neighbourhood for his family.\u201d\u201cIt seemed like the perfect choice,\u201d Manusco said.The mansion\u2019s owners, President Bill Clinton\u2019s former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart and his wife, live in New York, where he works for the NFL. The White House declined to comment on the possibility of the Obamas renting the property, first reported by .An individual familiar with the Obamas\u2019 plans said they had started their housing search and were currently looking at rental properties in a number of Washington neighbourhoods, including Kalorama. The individual wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the issue publicly and requested anonymity.It was unclear whether the Obamas had settled on the Kalorama property and formally leased it or whether they were still considering other options. Obama\u2019s aides and friends have been reluctant to discuss his plans in light of the intense security preparations the U.S. Secret Service must undertake to ensure the first family can be adequately protected while living in a private home.Obama has said publicly that he and his family plan to stay in Washington after leaving the White House until their youngest daughter, 14-year-old Sasha Obama, graduates from high school. Sasha\u2019s older sister, Malia Obama, graduates from high school this year and .\u201cTransferring someone in the middle of high school \u2014 tough,\u201d Obama said earlier this year in Milwaukee.Built in the 1920s, the mansion last sold in 2013 for about $5.3 million \u2014 a drop from the list price of about $6 million, according to real estate records. It was put on the market in 2012 for just under $8 million but later removed.For years, Obama has complained publicly about the lack of privacy that comes with life in the White House, and has said he\u2019s eagerly awaiting the day he can recapture some of the anonymity and freedom of movement he enjoyed before becoming president. Though his decision to remain temporarily in Washington may delay that, Obama is expected to spend considerable time in the coming years in Chicago, where his family owns a home and where his presidential library will be built, as well as in New York and in Hawaii, where Obama was born.\xa0', u'Eugenie Bouchard\u2019s struggles point to double standard, say expertsTORONTO \u2013 \u2018s  during her precipitous fall in the women\u2019s tennis rankings came as no surprise to one former Olympian who now works as a sports psychology consultant to some of Canada\u2019s top athletes.Former elite runner Penny Werthner says female athletes are held to a much different standard than their male counterparts.\u201cThe women athletes are criticized for what they wear, what they look like, whether they\u2019re fat or not,\u201d said Werthner, also dean of the faculty of kinesiology at the University of Calgary.\u201cWhen was the last time someone commented on what (Novak) Djokovic looked like? Or (pointed out that Rafael) Nadal is short?\u201dBouchard revealed earlier this week that she suffered from an eating disorder brought on by \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d following her 2014 breakthrough, when she finished the year ranked seventh in the world.The career-high came after her loss to Petra Kvitova in the Wimbledon final and semifinal appearances at the French Open and Australian Open.The success that season quickly launched her to tennis superstardom, drawing cameras, media and fans wherever she went.But the streak didn\u2019t last. Her first match after the Wimbledon final was the Rogers Cup in Montreal, where the hometown favourite disappointed with a 6-0, 2-6, 6-0 loss to 113th-ranked qualifier Shelby Rogers.It didn\u2019t get much better as the year wore on \u2014 her ranking plummeted to 48th at the end of 2015.Bouchard now says last year also featured a private battle to keep food down and maintain her weight.\u201cI just felt so nervous, it was hard to eat before matches and sometimes at other meals, just hard to keep it down. I didn\u2019t try to lose weight, but it definitely happened. It was definitely a cause of the stress. I\u2019ve learned a lot from it, and I know I just have to force food down my throat even if I feel sick because I am burning so many calories.\u201dWerthner says the push to succeed is especially hard in tennis because it\u2019s a solitary sport and comes with the added pressures of courting sponsors and endorsement deals.And in general, she said, it can be especially hard for women to rebound from a loss because they tend to take failures personally, while men will sometimes place the blame elsewhere.\u201cYou lose a match and then you lose a little bit of confidence and then maybe an eating disorder comes out of that or maybe it comes out of something else in her life that\u2019s not directly related to competitive sport,\u201d said Werthner, who has worked as a sports psychology consultant for the Canadian Olympic team since 1985.Bouchard, currently ranked 47th, was eliminated from the French Open on Thursday after a second-round loss to Timea Bacsinszky.Marbella Carlos of the National Eating Disorder Information Centre in Toronto says eating disorders are a coping mechanism and usually point to greater issues behind the scenes.And they can be especially common in \u201caesthetic sports\u201d like dance and gymnastics. She said tennis players also battle social stigmas that have nothing to do with their abilities.\u201cEven though they\u2019re elite athletes and do these incredible things with their bodies they\u2019re still looked at through a sexualized gaze, that definitely could have contributed as well,\u201d she said.Carlos hopes that Bouchard\u2019s comments can help other people struggling with food issues.\u201cThere are a lot, a lot of Canadians who are suffering in silence because there\u2019s still a lot of shame and stigma that\u2019s associated with mental illness and especially with eating disorders,\u201d she said.\u201cTypically people think eating disorders only strike a certain type of person but eating disorders affect people from all backgrounds, all ages, all genders, and all sizes.\u201d', u'What you should know before helping your kids with a down paymentOTTAWA \u2013 Helping your children with a downpayment on their first home may be tempting, but financial advisers say to be sure to fully grasp how it will affect your own retirement planning before cutting a cheque.Kristine Skinner, financial adviser with BlueShore Financial in West Vancouver, B.C., says before deciding to help, parents need to understand how it will affect their own net worth and overall financial plan.\u201cI would love to see both the parent and the child in my office so that they both understand the implications and expectations for every scenario,\u201d Skinner says.\u201cWith the parent and the child being in here, we can go over different considerations of the complexity of what they are planning on doing and any of the risks associated with the purchase.\u201dA survey by the Bank of Montreal earlier this year found that 65 per cent of millennials said that they would rely, to some extent, on parents or other family members for financial assistance for as much as 10 per cent of the purchase price of their first home.Skinner says there are several options parents could consider if they want to help their children buy their first home.\u201cEvery parent and child or siblings are different, so it really is case-specific to your whole situation \u2014 there is no one answer for everybody\u201d she says.You can give the money to your children as a gift, a plan of action that could require a letter confirming the cash is indeed a gift that they are able to show their potential lenders. Or you could lend them the money, which would also need to be disclosed, including the repayment requirements.How you come up with the cash for a gift can vary. If you don\u2019t have the cash on hand, you could cash out part of your portfolio or borrow the money.\u201cYou want to have an in-depth conversation with your children about what their monthly budget looks like and their ability to absorb any unforeseen expenses and ensure that they\u2019ve actually built that into their budget before agreeing to help them.\u201dIf generous parents opt to sell stocks or mutual funds to help their kids come up with the money, they could face a hefty tax bill depending on the amount. If they borrow they money, they won\u2019t have that problem, but will be charged interest and need to be sure that they have a plan to pay it back.Skinner said parents could also sign as a guarantor on their child\u2019s mortgage.But if choosing that path, she added, \u201cit is very important for the parent to really trust their child.\u201dHelping a child acquire more than the 20 per cent threshold for a downpayment could help save them thousands, because they will not need the government-mandated mortgage default insurance.Jason Hunt, manager of personal finance at Alterna Savings and Credit Union in Ottawa, said the amount a homebuyer could save by not needing that insurance could add up to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the size of the mortgage.But you also don\u2019t want your children to buy more house than they can afford. Mortgage payments are only part of the cost of homeownership. Property taxes, utilities, insurance, strata fees, maintenance costs and emergency repairs all add up.\xa0Skinner also notes that if you want to help your children buy their first home and you have more than one child, you should have a plan in place to ensure everyone is treated fairly.\u201cSome people may have it documented in their will that their son was given so much money and therefore they get that less out of the inheritance,\u201d she said.', u'Mean girls: Half of misogynistic tweets are sent by women, study showsMen are often blamed for most\xa0of the harassment women face online, but a new study shows that women themselves are responsible for half of the misogynistic comments made on social media. using an algorithm to weed out tweets that used the words in conversational tone or to discuss issues surrounding misogyny.Researchers found that 6,500 unique users in the U.K. were targeted with 10,000 misogynistic or aggressive tweets. Internationally, over 200,000 aggressive tweets using the same terms were sent to 80,000 people.But here\u2019s the twist \u2013 the study found 50 per cent of those aggressive tweets were sent by female users.\u201cThis study provides a bird\u2019s-eye snapshot of what is ultimately a very personal and often traumatic experience for women,\u201d said Alex Krasodomski-Jones, one of the researchers on the project.The fact that women often face abuse online is nothing new \u2013 an Australian report published in March found that nearly half of women have experienced harassment online; a Pew Research study found that number to be even higher at 73 per cent.But a lot of the stories surrounding that abuse have focused on men harassing women.Take for example  \u2013 the 2014 movement surrounding sexism and the harassment female gamers face from their male counterparts.Or last month\u2019s viral video that showed real men reading hateful, explicit and abusive comments sent to two female sports reporters \u2013 including lines like, \u201cI hope your boyfriend beats you,\u201d and \u201cLike the whore that you are.\u201dHowever, this study suggests that the \u201cMean Girls\u201d club is very much alive online.', u'Black bears attracted to stinky trash in Fort McMurrayFORT MCMURRAY, Alta. \u2013 Wildlife officers in Fort McMurray have killed two black bears and captured and relocated two others that were roaming in and around the fire-damaged city.Alberta government spokesman Brendan Cox said that May 3 \u2014 the day more than 80,000 people were  \u2014 also happened to be garbage day for most residential neighbourhoods.The stinky trash left on city streets attracted animals looking for an easy meal.\u201cWildlife is attracted to unnatural food sources,\u201d Cox said from Edmonton.Mayor Melissa Blake said on Thursday morning that the municipality has been going around neighbourhoods, removing\xa0the garbage bins to reduce the temptation.There have been 30 complaints about bears in the city in the past three weeks, Cox\xa0said. Although the city remains empty of residents, there are firefighters and others there working to restore utilities, repair and clean the city\u2019s hospital and reopen pharmacies and grocery stores.About 2,400 buildings were destroyed but fire crews managed to save almost 90 per cent of the oilsands city.Workers have cleaned up most of the garbage, Cox said.But foul odours will soon be returning.Residents may be allowed back into the community starting June 1, and those who didn\u2019t lose their homes to the flames will still need to clean up and throw out rotting food inside their refrigerators and freezers.\u201cWe would ask returning residents to ensure their appliances, garbage or any other attractants are secured until it can be picked up or delivered to a proper waste management facility,\u201d Cox said.A government guide on the phased re-entry process also advises people not to leave their doors open in case animals wander inside.The Fort McMurray area has always been popular for bears, said Cox.About eight wildlife officers remain in the community. They have set up bear traps in neighbourhoods of concern and will also be proactively placing traps in areas known to be frequented by bears outside the city to \u201cintercept\u201d them, Cox said.\u201cOfficers are going to continue to be focused on this for the forseeable future.\u201d', u'Living with parents until mid 30s more common than everWASHINGTON \u2013 Many of America\u2019s young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.For the first time on record, living with parents is now the most common arrangement for people ages 18 to 34, an analysis of census data by the\xa0 has found.And the proportion of older millennials \u2014 those ages 25 to 34 \u2014 who are living at home has reached its highest point (19 per cent) on record, Pew analysts said.Nearly one-third of all American millennials live with their parents, slightly more than the proportion who live with a spouse or partner. It\u2019s the first time that living at home has outpaced living with a spouse for this age group since such record-keeping began in 1880.The remaining young adults are living alone, with other relatives, in college dorms, as roommates or under other circumstances.More than 40 per cent of Canadians aged 20 to 29 also lived at home with their parents at last count.The sharp shift across the continent reflects a long-running decline in marriage, amplified by the economic upheavals of the recession.The trend has been particularly evident among Americans who lack a college degree.The pattern may be a contributing factor in the sluggish growth of the U.S. economy, which depends heavily on consumer spending. With more young people living with their parents rather than on their own, fewer people need to buy appliances, furniture or cable subscriptions. The recovery from the 2008-09 recession has been hobbled by historically low levels of home construction and home ownership.Jennifer Post, 26, has been living with her parents in Villas, New Jersey, since dropping out of law school two years ago.A law career wasn\u2019t a good fit for her, Post decided, and now she\u2019s seeking a job in digital media or marketing. There aren\u2019t many opportunities in Villas, a beach town.Even living at home, she said it\u2019s been hard to save for a move to a bigger city after she was laid off from a baking job in March.Post spends her days on her laptop, sending resumes and refreshing LinkedIn and other job sites. To her parents, it looks as though she\u2019s slacking off.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a generation gap,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they literally think I just sit down and watch Netflix all day.\u201dAs recently as 2000, nearly 43 per cent of young adults ages 18 to 34 were married or living with a partner. By 2014, that proportion was just 31.6 per cent.In 2000, only 23 per cent of young adults were living with parents. In 2014, the figure reached 32.1 per cent.The proportion of young adults living with their parents is similar to the proportions that prevailed from 1880 through 1940, when the figure peaked, Pew found. Yet in those decades, the most common arrangement for young adults was living with a spouse rather than with parents.The typical U.S. woman now marries at 27.1 years old, the typical man at 29.2, according to census data. That\u2019s up from record lows of 20.1 for women and 22.5 for men in 1956.\u201cThey\u2019re concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children,\u201d Fry said.The shift may also be disrupting the housing market. One mystery that\u2019s confounded analysts is why there aren\u2019t more homes for sale. The lack of available houses has driven up prices and made it less affordable for many would-be purchasers to buy.Nela Richardson, chief economist at real estate brokerage Redfin, says one explanation for the sparse supply is that many baby boomers aren\u2019t able to sell their family homes and downsize for retirement because they still have adult children living with them. Redfin surveyed homeowners ages 55 to 64 and found that one-fifth still have adult children at home.Among young men, declining employment and falling wages are another factor keeping many 18-to-34-year-olds unmarried, Fry said. The share of young men with jobs fell to 71 per cent in 2014 from 84 per cent in 1960 \u2014 the year when the proportion of young adults living outside the home peaked.Incomes have fallen, too: Wages, adjusted for inflation, plunged 34 per cent for the typical young man from 2000 to 2014.Other factors contributing to more millennials living with parents range from rising apartment rents to heavy student-debt loads to longer periods in college.Many analysts had expected that as the economy improved, younger adults would increasingly move out on their own. That hasn\u2019t happened. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says soaring rents are discouraging some from leaving their parents\u2019 homes.Kolko\u2019s research has found that the share of young adults living with parents in the first quarter of 2016 was essentially unchanged from two years earlier.Median rents nationwide were surging at a 6 per cent annual pace as recently as August, though they have slowed since. In fast-growing cities like San Francisco, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, rents rose last year at a double-digit pace.Heavier student debt loads have sent more young people back to their parents\u2019 nests, according to research by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Other economists aren\u2019t convinced that student debt plays a dominant role. They note that the proportion of young adults without college degrees who live with parents is especially high: Nearly 39 per cent of those with only a high school degree were living with a parent in 2014, up from around 26 per cent in 2000.That compares with just 19 per cent of young adult college grads living at home in 2014. That figure, though, is up sharply from 11 per cent in 2000.Still, economists say most millennials appear to be delaying, rather than avoiding, marriage.Casey Marshella moved back in with her parents in Fairfield, Connecticut, after graduating from Boston University last year. Just this week, she moved into an apartment with her sister. Within weeks, she and a friend \u2014 who also lives with her parents \u2014 expect to find their own place.Marshella, 22, says living at home has helped her save money from her job as a human resources specialist. Because many people her age share the same circumstances, most sympathize with her.Still, Marshella says their first question is usually, \u201cSo when are you planning on moving out?\u201d', u'What are the cheapest places for Canadians to fly? (Hint: not in Canada)We all know flying within Canada isn\u2019t cheap.

It comes\xa0in 15th with\xa0a $481 pricetag.But it can still cost you more to fly there than to Cancun, which lands in the 12th spot on the listThe most frequented\xa0Canadian destination is reportedly Vancouver, with its scenic ocean and mountain views.It\u2019s apparently the second most common\xa0place\xa0for us to visit, behind Manila in the Philippines.\xa0Los Angeles\xa0is the other top spot.\xa0For Torontonians looking for a trip outside North America, a flight to Paris ($762)\xa0or\xa0London ($789)\xa0may be their best bet.Those in Montreal might\xa0find airfare to Cancun ($475) or Varadero ($575) to be a steal.Cancun is also a cheap destination for Calgarians (at $502), whose next best out-of-continent\xa0option is Hong Kong ($1022).The Asian city gives Vancouverites the most bang for their buck (at $843), as well. Paris ($917) and Shanghai ($937) are their other two top options for lowest airfares.Winnipeg travellers could\xa0score a deal on a trip to Cancun ($507), London ($955) or Amsterdam ($1025).For\xa0a closer look at cheap fare options and cost-cutting city swaps,\xa0check out the infographic below from Cheapflights.ca.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: How to see if your power\xa0and natural gas are back onFort McMurray wildfire evacuees can now check an online tool to see if the electricity and natural gas have been turned back on in their homes.The  shows the electricity status of individual properties (with green or red dots), and natural gas status of neighbourhoods.Blue shaded areas have natural gas service; red shaded areas do not.

Thousands of homes have sat untouched for three weeks, much of that time without utilities.If a residence is shown on the map to have electricity but owners return home to find that\u2019s not the case, they\u2019re asked to check their main electric panel and breaker for any blown fuses or tripped breakers. ATCO said simply moving any tripped switches to the \u2018on\u2019 position can restore electricity. If this doesn\u2019t restore electricity, residents were asked to call the Electricity 24/7 emergency outage line at 1-800-668-5506.Because workers are still restoring electricity infrastructure damaged during the fire, returning residents are asked to go through their house and unplug any unnecessary appliances to reduce the load.ATCO said it is unable to identify, house by house, how long the electricity was out, therefore it asked people to assume all perishables are no longer fit for consumption.Customers who contacted their utility company to end electricity or natural gas service are asked to please call them to reactivate the account.Below is a tip sheet for restoring electricity and natural gas services to your home.\xa0', u'Canadian researcher hopes to prove exercise can be an anti-cancer \u2018drug\u2019A Canadian researcher is leading\xa0an international clinical trial that he hopes can change\xa0the way we treat cancer.The current focus is\xa0on advanced  patients who\u2019ve stopped responding to traditional treatments. The hope is to extend their life through a\xa0structured, high-intensity workout regimen.\u201cWe want to actually prove [exercise]\xa0does more than just makes you feel better and actually prolongs your survival,\u201d\xa0explained\xa0Dr. Fred Saad, a urologist-oncologist at the .Prostate cancer patients whose options have seemingly run out are encouraged to ask their doctors to join the randomized trial. It\u2019s already been launched in Australia and Ireland and is expected to run in at least 10 Canadian cities, including\xa0Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.Those\xa0who volunteer will be led through\xa0an hour of aerobic and resistance training three times a week, and compared against a control group who will only get general exercise\xa0recommendations.It\u2019s reportedly the\xa0largest\xa0research project to ever be\xa0funded by the \xa0and will cost an estimated $10 million.It\xa0builds on other Canadian research\xa0that\u2019s examined the benefits of a regular dose\xa0of exercise.A 2013 , for instance,\xa0found patients who did 60 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week\xa0had a lower risk of recurrence of the disease and a longer survival.This clinical trial will be the largest ever of its kind, Saad said, and the first to hopefully prove the link between exercise and cancer survival.Life-prolonging cancer drugs \u2014 which he said can cost $50,000 a year for one person\xa0\u2014\xa0can take a toll on patients, often making them lose their hair as well as\xa0causing pain and complications.Those chemotherapy side effects are thought to be lessened by\xa0exercise, as it\u2019s\xa0believed to strengthen bones and muscles.The roughly 100 international researchers working on this study\xa0figure if patients can tolerate more therapy through\xa0exercise, they\u2019ll ultimately live longer.Results won\u2019t be known for five years, so it\u2019s still too early to tell if the findings could be extended to other types of cancer.But \u201cresearchers are betting that exercise could well become the .\u201d', u'Finding a job is a major problem for military spouses: studyWASHINGTON \u2013 Military spouses struggle to find jobs and are more likely to work for less pay or in positions below their education level, spurring unemployment and other costs of as much as $1 billion a year, according to a study.Wrestling with frequent moves, deployments and erratic schedules of their service member mates, military spouses have an unemployment rate of up to 18 per cent, compared to last month\u2019s national jobless rate of 5 per cent.The problem is not new to the Pentagon, and in recent years has triggered a flood of new programs aimed at encouraging companies to hire military veterans and spouses.The latest study was commissioned by Blue Star Families, a group that co-ordinates services for families with a loved one who is currently serving or has served in the military. And it found that up to 42 per cent of military spouses \u2014 or as many as 95,000 \u2014 are jobless, compared to about 25 per cent of a comparable civilian spouse population. In addition, it estimated that military spouses with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn 40 per cent less than their civilian counterparts.The report noted that various groups have done studies on military spouse unemployment that yielded varying statistics. But there was broad agreement on the overall conclusion that they face higher unemployment rates than civilians, especially those of comparable age.\u201cThe math is shocking, but it also shows the way forward,\u201d said Kathy Roth-Douquet, founder and chief executive officer of Blue Star Families.And she called on the government and private companies to do more to battle spouse unemployment in the same way they did to beef up the hiring of veterans.\u201cMilitary spouses are faced with unique challenges in starting and maintaining a career as a result of the military lifestyle they lead that requires frequent moves and sometimes being the single parent while their military spouse is deployed,\u201d said Marine Lt. Col. Gabrielle Hermes, a Pentagon spokeswoman.Defence Department data from surveys comes up with different numbers, finding that 23 per cent of military spouses identify themselves as unemployed.According to the study, the estimated cost of the problem is largely borne by the federal government, including unemployment and health care benefits and lost income taxes. The study estimated that those costs ranged from about $710 million to $1.07 billion per year.There has been increased attention on veteran and military-related unemployment issues over the past decade, particularly as service members came home from repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and found it difficult to find jobs after they left the military. That focus has also expanded to spouses, who often find themselves moving every two or three years and often can\u2019t find jobs that are flexible enough to compensate for the long hours, absences and irregular schedules of their spouses while still meeting any child care needs.The study found that getting meaningful employment is a major concern for spouses. And more than half of them say that having a spouse in the military has a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on their ability to find a job that meets their education and experience levels.As of 2015, there were about 564,000 female civilian spouses of active duty military members nationwide, and 70 per cent of them were under the age of 35.The Pentagon and military services have a number of websites and jobs programs, including ones aimed at military spouses. The Military Spouse Employment Partnership has job listings, resume tips, career counselling and other assistance. According to the Defence Department, partner employers have posted more than 4 million jobs in the past five years.The Joining Forces initiative launched by First Lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden in 2011 has helped more than 1.2 million veterans and spouses get hired or trained, according to numbers announced earlier this month. Of those, Hermes said that about 95,000 were military spouses.Another program provides up to $4,000 in scholarships to eligible spouses to pursue certifications, licenses or other degrees.Hermes said that the department is assessing the effectiveness of the programs, adding that getting information about them can be a challenge especially when so many military spouses transition out of the military every year and new spouses join. She said the department relies on experts who work for the military services as well as other organizations, employers and communities, to help get the word out.', u'Babies behind bars: Should moms do time with their newborns?BEDFORD HILLS, N.Y. \u2013 Jennifer Dumas sits on a sofa, her smiling 6-month-old girl on her lap. The room is full of bright toys and children\u2019s books. A rainbow-colored activity mat is on the floor, and Winnie the Pooh is painted on the walls.It looks like any other nursery, except that there are bars on the windows and barbed-wire fences outside the austere brick building.New York\u2019s maximum-security Bedford Hills Correctional Facility is one of the very few prisons in the U.S. that allow inmates and their babies to live together, a century-old approach that not all corrections experts agree is the best way to deal with women locked up while pregnant.Mothers who get such a chance say it\u2019s better than the alternative: In most prisons, babies born behind bars must be given up within a day to a relative or foster care.\u201cBefore I came here, I thought it was a terrible idea. A baby in prison? No, thank you,\u201d the 24-year-old Dumas said as her daughter, Codylynn, gleefully rocked in a bouncy seat. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually wonderful to be able to spend this much time with my little girl. \u2026 I\u2019m blessed to be able to go through this.\u201dNobody thinks raising babies behind bars is ideal, and some worry that the children could be scarred by the experience. But some advocates say that the practice allows mother and child to develop a vital psychological attachment, and that the parenting classes and other practical instruction help the moms stay out of trouble when they get out.About 112,000 women are in U.S. state and federal prisons, mostly for drug or property crimes. And an estimated 1 in 25 are pregnant when they enter, according to the non-profit Sentencing Project. But there are no national statistics on the number of babies born to inmates.Of the more than 100 women\u2019s prisons in the U.S., there are eight nurseries. While nearly 100 countries, including South Sudan and France, have national laws that allow for incarcerated mothers to stay with their babies, the U.S. is not among them.Dumas was three weeks pregnant when she was arrested last year, along with her boyfriend, on charges they tried to steal a safe packed with $32,000 in cash and jewelry. Her baby was born just days after she took a plea bargain on attempted burglary charges that sent her to Bedford Hills, about an hour north of New York City, for up to two years.She is now among 15 carefully screened new mothers allowed to serve up to 18 months of their sentences in a nursery unit that includes a communal playroom stocked with toys and mother-and-child rooms equipped with a single bed and a crib. The walls are painted with rainbows, fluffy clouds and jungle and barnyard scenes. The nursery currently has 16 babies, including a set of twins.During workday hours, the babies are taken across the street to a day care centre, where they are watched by staff and other inmates while the moms go to school or vocational programs.But there are constant reminders it is a prison. Armed officers patrol the unit. And the moms know their babies can be taken away for such infractions as fighting or even leaving a toy in a crib while the baby sleeps.\u201cIt\u2019s still scary,\u201d Dumas said. \u201cAt any given point if you do what you\u2019re not supposed to your baby could get sent home.\u201dSome women have been dropped from the program from time to time for breaking the rules, but corrections officials and advocates said they could not recall any instances in recent years in which a baby was harmed.Still, some argue that prison should be reserved for punishment and that women should instead consider putting their children up for adoption.\u201cThe focus should be on what\u2019s best for the baby,\u201d said James Dwyer, a law professor at the College of William & Mary who has written a paper on the topic. \u201cThere is skepticism about these women being adequate parents.\u201dColumbia University researcher Mary Byrne, who spent years studying mothers and children who started life in Bedford Hills, said that the youngsters formed critical attachments to their mothers and that a second study after they were released found they were no different from children raised entirely on the outside.Sister Teresa Fitzgerald, the Roman Catholic nun who runs Hour Children, the non-profit organization that operates Bedford Hills\u2019 nursery, put it more bluntly:The nursery is operated under an annual contract with the state of about $170,000, the correction department said. It would cost $480,000 a year to put 16 babies in foster care, according to state figures.Bedford Hills\u2019 recidivism rate for women in the nursery program is fairly typical of such programs, at 13 per cent versus 26 per cent for all female inmates at the prison, according to a report by the Women\u2019s Prison Association, an advocacy group.Bedford Hills has the oldest continuously operating prison nursery in the country, opened in 1901. There were many nurseries years ago, according to Elaine Lord, the former superintendent. But they fell out of favour amid a huge influx of prisoners in the 1980s and a shift in thinking that said the privilege of living with your baby was inconsistent with the concept of punishment.Most of the nation\u2019s prison nurseries have cropped up in the past 20 years.The nursery at the Indiana Women\u2019s Prison houses up to 10 mother-infant pairs for up to 18 months. In South Dakota, a child can stay only 30 days. In Washington state, it\u2019s three years. The Decatur Correctional Center in Illinois opened a nursery in 2007, and 73 moms have participated.In Decatur, Kalee Ford, who is about 26 weeks pregnant and in prison on a drug-related conviction, already has been accepted into the program and is taking prenatal courses. She said she wasn\u2019t the mother she could have been to her two other children because of methamphetamine. The program is giving her hope that she can clean up for good.\u201cI believe that everybody deserves at least one chance to fix mistakes that they\u2019ve made,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children didn\u2019t do this, and they deserve to have me back.\u201dAt Decatur, Bedford Hills and other programs, mothers-to-be are selected based on their crimes and whether there is any history of child abuse.Many advocates question why such women need to be incarcerated at all. Typically, women accepted into these programs are nonviolent offenders serving fairly short sentences \u2014 ideal candidates for less-expensive, halfway house-like programs for mother and child.After their sentences are up, almost all of the mothers at Bedford go to a live-in halfway house in New York City run by Fitzgerald\u2019s organization that also helps with day care and jobs. Mothers say it\u2019s a golden ticket.Dumas, who has a son on the outside, hopes to go there, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a way to get on my feet, try being a parent again on the outside but with a safety net,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who gets that.\u201d', u'3 takes on bruschetta for a satisfying picnic main dishThere are few dishes more elemental and satisfying than bruschetta. A mainstay at many Italian restaurants, it\u2019s an appetizer comprising slices of grilled bread adorned with any number of toppings. According to Italian cookbook author Marcella Hazan, bruschetta likely originated in ancient Rome. Olive growers who brought their produce there to be pressed would sample the flavour of the fresh-squeezed oil on toasted slices of bread. (The word is derived from the Roman verb bruscare, meaning \u201cto roast over coals.\u201d)I like to make bruschetta on my stovetop grill at home during the colder months. It\u2019s a winning accompaniment to just about any soup or stew and a reliable favourite with the family. Having recently come to the conclusion that there was no good reason why this simple and tasty concoction should be limited to an appetizer or side dish, I have here chosen to cast bruschetta as the star of a summer picnic.As noted, bruschetta is simple to make. But you need to work with high-quality ingredients if you want it to turn out beautifully. Start with a loaf of fresh and crusty rustic bread. Then brush each slice of bread with your very best extra-virgin olive oil to before it heads for the grill. When the bread comes off the grill, and while it\u2019s still hot, rub one side of each slice with a cut clove of garlic. Then top it off with a light sprinkling of sea salt. By the way, this technique works just as well using a grill pan in the kitchen as it does with a grill outdoors.This recipe spells out three different toppings, all vaguely Mediterranean: a white bean salad with fresh fennel thickened with mashed beans so that the filling sticks to the bread; smoked salmon rillettes \u2014 finely-chopped salmon flavoured with capers, lemon and fresh herbs and bound with sour cream; and a chopped Greek salad. Again, I recommend using your best extra-virgin olive oil for the dressings. Each topping yields roughly two cups which should be ample to top four large slices of grilled bread.But bruschetta is nothing if not basic, meaning that just about any filling you\u2019d ordinarily put between two slices of bread will also work as a topping for bruschetta: egg salad, tuna salad, runny cheese, hummus, grilled vegetables, you name it. Just bring the toppings in jars to the picnic, step aside, and watch everyone go for theirs. No one\u2019s going to wonder where the sandwiches are when bruschetta is on the picnic menu.Start to finish: 25 minutesServings: 4In a bowl combine all the ingredients and stir gently until just combined.

With a little planning, a vegetable garden can be pretty enough to set out in the front yard.Here are some tips for how it can be done.A vegetable garden that satisfies the eyes as well as the tongue must have a sense of order that is both pleasing and lasting. An expanse of dirt streaked with straight rows of vegetables \u2014 the traditional vegetable patch \u2014 does have order, but it\u2019s more functional than attractive. And after autumn, it\u2019s not much more than an expanse of dirt.Instead, why not lay out the garden with permanent beds and paths in an arrangement that, while functional, also creates a design? Picture a neat arrangement of rectangular beds or beds radiating out to form a wheel.Be deliberate in your choice of materials to cover the paths for your design. The paths, after all, will highlight the shapes of the beds. And it\u2019s much nicer to walk on flagstones, pebbles, wood chips, sawdust or lawn grass than in mud.Adding a third dimension \u2014 height \u2014 turns a vegetable garden into a sculpture. And this third dimension can be a year-round feature, unlike the vegetable plants themselves, most of which are annuals that dissolve into the soil in winter.A fence is perhaps the most obvious third dimensional feature: Not wobbly chicken wire tacked onto wooden stakes all askew, but a fence of substance as well as function \u2014 perhaps something informal crafted from cedar or locust posts, or something formal created from sawn lumber. Pay attention to the gate, too, again combining function and appearance.A bench, birdbath or gazing globe are other features that can help a vegetable garden look good through the year. Besides adding a third dimension to the lines created by beds and paths, features like these can create enclosure, or act as visual focal points \u2014 a bench at the end of a path, for instance, or a birdbath at the intersection of two wide main paths.Plants themselves can also add sculptural mass to the scene. Hedges that are evergreen or densely twigged are best for creating a bold 3-D effect. To keep them from hogging the scene and robbing the vegetables of food and water, keep them proportional to the size of the garden. Even a small garden can have some beds or main paths bordered by such plants as dwarf boxwood or germander shrubs.No need to exclude purely ornamental plants from your vegetable patch. Currant bushes are both small and ornamental, their lacy flowers morphing into berries that dangle like red jewels. Roses would enjoy the high fertility of a vegetable garden; how about two compact bushes flanking either side of that bench?Weeds are mostly non-ornamental, especially the way they appear willy-nilly, so try to keep them in check.Let\u2019s not forget about vegetables themselves in the design of this ornamental, edible vegetable garden. Visually, they offer a range of textures and colours, and, with their rapid development, add a dynamic quality to the scene.Peppers and eggplants, purple basil and some of the Swiss chards with colorful stalks are among the particularly ornamental vegetables. Asparagus creates a ferny backdrop from July onwards; parsley could become a low, verdant hedge.The many colours, textures and shapes of lettuce make it one of my favourite ornamental vegetables. One year, I juxtaposed blocks of red, green, frilly and smooth-leaved varieties to create a beautiful patchwork quilt. The only problem was that eating the lettuces eroded the design.\xa0', u'Trudeau took a day off in the name of \u2018work-life balance\u2019 \u2013 should we all follow suit? has unwittingly stirred up a national debate about work-life balance, one that experts say has the potential to influence some healthy lifestyle changes in some Canadians.Conservative critics and skeptical Canadians have expressed concerns about the leader\u2019s decision to take a personal day in the midst of his trip to Japan,  in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.Trudeau cleared his schedule Wednesday to take his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, to a romantic inn  \u2013 a decision he said is an example of \u201cthe kind of work-life balance that I\u2019ve often talked about as being essential in order to be able to be in service of the country with all one\u2019s very best.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see your hubbub about nannies and extra help and raise you an anniversary abroad. Bold,\u201d Andrew MacDougall, a former communications director for Stephen Harper, quipped on Twitter.And while there are some questions surrounding the logistics of taking a spa day in the midst of a political trip (the prime minister\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t say how many staff he has in tow \u2014 although Trudeau noted he personally paid for the getaway), some argued the move was a selfish waste of taxpayer dollars.But some believe that Trudeau is setting a good example \u2014 one that more people should consider following.\u201cPeople generally need to try to create that kind of balance and take time off if it\u2019s possible \u2014 especially when there are important events or occasions,\u201d said Dr. Scott Schieman, \u201cI think even the prime minister deserves a day or two. It\u2019s a question of what\u2019s reasonable \u2014 one would imagine that he probably works all the time.\u201dAccording to Schieman, multiple studies have shown that achieving a good work-life balance \u2014 or taking time to focus on yourself or your family when needed \u2014 can improve overall work ethic and performance. Not to mention it\u2019s good for your sanity.The 2011 Canadian Work Stress and Health study found roughly one\xa0in three\xa0Canadians feel overwhelmed by work and the demands of their job.But Schieman believes all Canadians can achieve the kind of work-life balance that Trudeau appears to embrace.His best advice for doing so: take a hard look at all of the roles you encompass \u2014 from your career, to your relationship or caretaker roles \u2014 and understand what it is people really expect from you.If that means you think it\u2019s important to spend your anniversary at a romantic inn to foster the health of your marriage, then do so.\u201cThe example [Trudeau] is setting is not about balance \u2014 but about sticking to what is important to you,\u201d said Caird Urquhart, \u201cOne of his core values is family and marriage. That is going to stabilize him in the long run because he is honouring something that is important to him.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Nickelback, Corb Lund, Randy Bachman among Fire Aid concert actsA little ol\u2019 band from southern Alberta \u2013 you might have heard of them \u2013 is coming home to help the thousands of people affected by the devastating Fort McMurray wildfire.Nickelback is among the dozen or so performers at the Fire Aid Concert, to be held Wednesday, June 29 at Edmonton\u2019s Commonwealth Stadium. Between 40,000 and 45,000 seats will be available.\u201cThe wildfires have affected the entire country. \xa0The devastation, images and stories of the lives shattered by this resonate with everyone; but, perhaps none more so than Albertans,\u201d Nickelback\u2019s Ryan Peake said. \xa0\u201cAlberta is home for us and we\u2019ve never shied from that.\u201cIt\u2019s the least we could do and we are humbled to be a part of this event with so many talented artists. \xa0So many people have answered the call for help already. \xa0This is the least we can do and we hope that our efforts can assist those that need it most,\u201d Peake said.The concert will also feature Blue Rodeo, Corb Lund, Dean Brody, The Rankin Family, Dallas Smith, Brett Kissel, Randy Bachman with The Sadies, Ian Tyson, Alan Doyle and the Beautiful Gypsies, Dear Rouge, and High Valley.Tickets will cost $35, $60 and $99 and .A program is being set up through Ticketmaster that will allow buyers to purchase extra tickets that will then be distributed to Fort McMurray residents.The football stadium concert venue could\xa0accommodate between 40,000 and 45,000 people, an organizer said. None of the performers are being paid and the organizing group is working with donors and sponsors to handle travel and other expenses.All funds raised will go directly to the Fort McMurray United Way. The United Way will work with the various agencies on the ground in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo to help the thousands of\xa0affected residents.\u201cOn behalf of my entire community, we\u2019re truly overwhelmed by the support shown to us over the past three weeks,\u201d Diane Shannon, executive director of the Fort McMurray United Way, said, her voice breaking.\u201cToday particularly I\u2019m so grateful and so moved to be here and to know that the proceeds of Fire Aid will have a profound impact on our ability to allocate the resources necessary to rebuild lives and provide hope to many.\u201dThe concert is being planned by members of Alberta\u2019s Fire Aid Organizing Committee, a group of citizens who got together in a Calgary pub a few weeks ago to begin planning the event.Jeff Parry, a Calgary-based concert promoter and producer, was involved in the 2013 southern Alberta flood benefit concert and said Edmonton\u2019s Commonwealth Stadium seemed like an obvious choice for Fire Aid.\u201cThe money is one thing, but bringing communities together\u2026 it\u2019s like your barn\u2019s burned down and everyone is going to go and help fix the barn.

Study claims to have the formulaYour partner may not be your soulmate\xa0\u2014 but that\xa0doesn\u2019t mean you two can\u2019t have a long and happy relationship, science shows.\u201cAlmost none of us are going to get our ideal partners,\u201d said\xa0psychology researcher Daniel Conroy-Beam of the University of Texas.After all, he added, the chances of finding someone single in your area\xa0who meets all your criteria is \u201cvery low.\u201dThe good news?\xa0\u201cWe don\u2019t need have to have our ideal partners to be satisfied,\u201d he said.All you need, according to his , is someone\xa0you think is a catch compared to what you bring to the table and\xa0the other options on\xa0the market.Those\xa0who rated themselves as having\xa0fewer\xa0desirable traits\xa0than their partner\xa0\xa0\u2014 i.e. they thought their partner was a better catch than they were \u2014 were generally more happy with their relationships.The survey included people who\u2019d been married for years as well as those who\u2019d just started dating.The average survey respondents were in their mid 30s, but Conroy-Beam said the findings were consistent across age and gender.What both sexes\xa0considered desirable, though, did differ slightly.The qualities most-coveted by women (in order of desirability) were: a pleasant personality, kind, dependable, emotionally stable, intelligent, healthy, confident, desires a home and child, masculine, and ambitious.The characteristics at the bottom of their list were: someone who\u2019s chaste, a good cook, muscular, dominant, or feminine.Men were most likely to seek someone with the following traits: a pleasant personality, emotionally stable, kind, dependable, intelligent, healthy, feminine, and physically attractive.They didn\u2019t care as much about finding a mate who: has good financial prospects, is chaste, dominant, muscular, or masculine.Our mate preferences also seem to\xa0affect\xa0our relationship dynamics, the researchers found.People who thought their partners were either better than them or close to perfect, devoted more effort into hanging on to\xa0them.\u201cThis included making themselves extra attractive for their partners and \u2018mate guarding,\u2019 or shielding their partners from mating rivals to help keep their partners,\u201d Conroy-Beam said in a statement.Unfortunately, jealousy and possessiveness don\u2019t tend to end well.', u'Eugenie Bouchard reveals struggle with eating disorderPARIS \u2013 Canadian tennis star  says she has overcome an eating disorder brought on by \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d and the added expectation that followed her breakthrough year in 2014.Speaking after a first-round victory Tuesday at the French Open, Bouchard said she felt as though food \u201cwould come right back up\u201d and struggled with weight loss in 2015, when her ranking slipped.The 22-year-old Canadian finished 2014 with a career-high year-end ranking of seventh, after her Wimbledon final loss to Petra Kvitova and semifinal appearances at the French Open and Australian Open.Bouchard cruised into the second round Tuesday, beating Germany\u2019s Laura Siegemund 6-2, 6-2.Fellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil of Vancouver was eliminated after a 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 loss Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic.', u'5 summer grilling tips from a BBQ expertBarbecue expert Danielle Bennett offers some of her top tips of the trade for success on the grill:Since all grills differ, read the owner\u2019s manual for recommendations for yours. Do a full inspection, checking hoses and lines to be sure there are no cracks and that no rodents have moved in over the winter. Grates should be cleaned to prevent buildup of bacteria, which could be transferred to the next food you cook.Pitch the fork that\u2019s included in most commercially sold barbecue kits, says Bennett. The sharp points pierce whatever you\u2019re grilling, allowing precious moisture to escape. Bennett prefers gloved hands or long heavy-duty tongs to move around charcoal and meats. Use one set of tongs for raw foods and another for cooked to avoid transferring bacteria. Similarly, don\u2019t place cooked food on the same platter that held raw meat.The more you oil your grill, the more non-stick it becomes. Bennett uses an inexpensive bar cloth folded accordion-style, tied in the centre with kitchen twine, then doubled over. She dips it in oil and rubs it over the grates. Because the oil soaks into the cloth, she\u2019s not dripping copious amounts over live fire, causing flareups. The cloth can be washed and reused. Bennett recommends canola and sunflower oil for their higher smoke point rather than olive oil.One of the biggest mistakes people make is applying sweet sugary sauce at the beginning of the cooking process. If you add it too early it\u2019s more likely to burn. Instead, brush it on during the last five to 10 minutes of cooking.Keep the grill lid closed. If you\u2019re looking, you\u2019re not cooking. Each time the lid is raised, heat escapes and your food will take longer to cook.', u'A summer BBQ and BLT spin on the classic grilled cheese sandwichSeveral weeks ago when we rolled out the grill for the first time of the season, there was much joy. What to grill first? Ribs? Burgers? Pizza? So many choices.This is the sandwich that triumphed: A marriage of a summer BLT and an actually grilled-grilled-cheese sandwich. The buttery crunch of the bread, the juicy tomatoes, the melty cheese, the crisp bacon and lettuce \u2014 these two sandwiches were meant to find each other and become one.You can use iceberg lettuce if you want more of a crunch, and you can experiment with various types of cheese and bacon or pancetta. User your imagination, and this recipe will make this the summer of grilled cheese.Start to finish: 20 minutesServings: 4Preheat the grill to medium low.Butter one side of each of the pieces of bread. Evenly divide the cheese between 4 slices of the bread, on the un-buttered sides. Place all of the bread, buttered side down, on the grill and cover the grill. Grill the bread until the bottom is lightly marked with grill marks and the cheese is melted. You may need to remove the plain pieces of bread first, and move the cheese covered pieces to the top grill rack and cover the grill for a couple of extra minutes, so that the cheese melts but the bottoms of the bread slices don\u2019t burn.Spread the mayonnaise evenly over the unbuttered sides of the 4 pieces of plain toast. On the melted cheese slices, layer the bacon, lettuce and tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Place the mayonnaise spread slices mayo-side down on the sandwiches, slice, and eat warm. 1042 calories; 270 calories from fat; 30 g fat (13 g saturated; 0 g trans fats); 54 mg cholesterol; 2169 mg sodium; 150 g carbohydrate; 8 g fiber; 15 g sugar; 43 g protein.\xa0', u'\u2018Arms race\u2019: LEGO toys have been getting more and more violentAre your child\u2019s toys more violent than the ones you remember?A new study from researchers in New Zealand suggests that LEGO toys have\xa0become more violent over the years.The study, published online in the, looked at all LEGO block sets sold since 1949, and found \u201csignificant exponential increases of violence over time.\u201dThe inclusion of weapons started slow, they said. The first weapons included were a sword, axe and lance in a castle set in 1979.But it spiked dramatically when the company began producing blasters to include with their Star Wars sets, introduced at around 2007.Now 30 per cent of all sets included a weapon.The increase in violent pieces in LEGO follows an increase of violent movies, the study says.\u201cCreators and producers of games and movies strive to push the limits of what violent media is allowed to be released to prevent their audience from getting bored of similar content,\u201d it reads.While exposure to violent video games and media has been linked to an increase of aggressive behaviour and a decrease of empathy in children, the same has not been proven for an exposure to violent toys.\u201cIn my experience as a psychiatrist, and as a parent, it really comes down to the context in which that weapon is being utilized and the guidance provided,\u201d\xa0, child psychiatrist\xa0and author of The Dolphin Parent, says.But there\u2019s another side of the issue she\u2019s worried about. She says branded LEGO sets that include weapons, like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, are taking some of the imagination out of playtime.\u201cInstead of having a nameless, faceless character that can do whatever the child imagines it can do, it\u2019s now Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader\u2026\u201cDarth Vader is always going to be evil and mean. So that takes the imagination away, and it also encourages the violence\u2026 because the character is so set.\u201d\xa0\xa0', u'Safe sex misconceptions: Things you should know about STIsCanadian communities \u2014 and much of the world \u2014 are in the grips of a historic outbreak of sexually transmitted infections.We asked an STI clinician and an epidemiologist\xa0for some tips, and the things\xa0they wish people knew. You can\u2019t get diseases though oral sex. You can contract gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, HPV and herpes simplex virus from any oral-genital contact. It\u2019s very difficult to transmit HIV through oral sex, however \u2014 0.01 per cent risk if you\u2019re giving, 0.05-0.1 per cent if you\u2019re receiving. If you feel fine, you\u2019re fine. Most STIs are asymptomatic. The only way to know if you have them is to get tested. You\u2019ll know if your sexual partner has an STI by looking at them. Nope. You can get STIs from toilet seats.\xa0Nope. If you only have sex with someone once you\u2019re probably fine. Any kind of sexual contact with someone, even if it\u2019s only once, can get you infected. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of sex you\u2019re having \u2014 if it\u2019s unprotected, it\u2019s unprotected. Sexual contact involving any kind of abrasion\xa0\u2014 from a canker to a cut \u2014 increases the likelihood of transmission. Getting an STI once means you\u2019re immune later. Nope. (Some strains of chlamydia may confer a degree of protection from re-infection, but for syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis you can get infected again and again.) If you\u2019re not having sex with a new person every night, you don\u2019t need to get tested. You should get tested between sexual partners, right after getting a new partner, and once every three to six months if you\u2019re having sex with multiple people over that period of time. If you\u2019re in a long-term, monogamous relationship, you can get tested whenever you get regular physicals. Women get tested when they get pap smears. You should ask to get tested when this procedure is done.', u'Tracking sexually transmitted infections in a Tinder ageDating apps are an easy target when it comes to placing blame for the .But .The internet factor does more than facilitate casual sex: It makes it tougher to\xa0track down\xa0the former sexual partners of infected people, which makes it tougher to track and prevent an illness from spreading.\u201cIf we can\u2019t reach contacts at all, then there\u2019s no way for us to let them know that they have been named,\u201d\xa0says Ameeta Singh, an infectious disease specialist who works at an Edmonton STI clinic.If you\u2019re diagnosed with a reportable, communicable illness, a public health nurse will ask you for a list of your recent sexual partners so they can follow up with them. (They don\u2019t tell the people they call who named them.)This used to be a series of names and phone numbers. \u201cWe had one guy come in with a typed list,\u201d Singh recalls.But it\u2019s tough if your point of contact is a ,  or  account.\u201cSeveral provinces have attempted to do so and they haven\u2019t been able to get around some of the legal and privacy issues. \u2026 You don\u2019t know who has access to that person\u2019s profile.\u201d contacts people by social media when it has to, says Anthony Leonard, the agency\u2019s manager of .\u201cWhen individuals do not have contact information for former partners, our managers and staff may work through the online or social media applications mentioned in the case history,\u201d reads an emailed statement attributed to Leonard.The\xa0ease of anonymity and online identity fluidity pose problems, however.\u201cIndividuals may forget screen names of past partners or they may be only geo-locational. For example, you hook up with a person today on an online hook-up site that\u2019s close by, but they may not be in your area again and therefore it\u2019s difficult to find them on the site if they did not know the profile name, or there are limited online photos,\u201d he wrote. says public health officials are allowed to\xa0communicate with people via social media \u201cwhere it is the only method of communication available,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.\u201cHowever, public health officials generally must not disclose identifying information unless it is necessary to do so. It may be the case, in these circumstances, that public health officials are not disclosing any identifying health information when contacting people who may have been exposed to communicable diseases.\u201dScott Sibbald, spokesperson for , says it isn\u2019t something the office has dealt with.But\xa0there are questions that come up in dealing with personal health information and online platforms.\u201cDespite the convenience, use of social media to collect, use or disclose personal or health information raises issues concerning security of confidential personal or health information, as well as the accuracy of the information,\u201d he wrote in an email.\u201cWhat controls are in place to protect the information collected, used or disclosed on social media? And exactly what personal or health information is being shared or sought through social media? Those are just a couple of the questions that would need to be asked.\u201dBut even if it\u2019s kosher under Canadian privacy laws,  won\u2019t give health officials that data.The internet and the applications it\u2019s spawned don\u2019t make people more inclined toward casual sex, says University of Toronto epidemiologist Dionne Gesink.\u201cIt makes it easier and faster to find partners,\u201d she said.\u201cIt makes the sexual network more complicated: It creates more ties in the sexual network, which means things can spread.\u201dThat\u2019s what Gesink is setting out to explore now. She and her colleagues at Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health are embarking on an in-depth study to map Toronto\u2019s \u201csexual networks\u201d \u2014 specifically among men who have sex with men.They\u2019re looking for interviewees, so if you want to talk to them about the way you seek partners and your sex practices, give them a shout: .', u'6 items that save you hundreds of dollars over timeOne lesson that we never seem to learn is that buying the cheapest option often ends up costing more in the long run. With many items, it\u2019s well worth looking past the initial cost because over time, they can actually save you hundreds of dollars. The secret, of course, is to use these six items so that you will get your money\u2019s worth.According to , you can save about $200 over five years by using a clothesline instead of an electric dryer, and that\u2019s excluding the cost of buying the electric dryer in the first place. And for the winter, you can get indoor clotheslines for as little as $5. suggests that if you use an electric dryer, you should invest in a set of dryer balls, which cost about the same as fabric softener and make the product\xa0unnecessary. They also cut down\xa0on\xa0the time it takes to dry your clothes by nearly half, saving you electricity.As  says, it\u2019s wise to pay a little more for rechargeable batteries that will last you for years. A household battery charger will set you back about $20 or $30 and usually comes with rechargeable batteries included. notes that many utility providers in Canada offer credits on future energy bills if you go solar. Switching to solar power can cost a lot, but you can save now by opting for a portable kit for around $350 to use as a back-up for charging your computer, phone or other electronics. says that you can save as much as $500 over five years if you switch to cloth napkins and dishcloths rather than using paper towels. You\u2019ll produce less household waste, too. says that even an expensive bike for commuting can pay for itself in less than a month if you consider the cost of buying and maintaining a car as well as the price of gas and parking. Of course, biking to work can also save you the cost of going to the gym.', u'The cheapest travel destinations for 2016 revealedEvery year, the website ranks world cities according to how affordable they are for budget travellers. The 2016 Backpacker Index looks at the price of a dorm bed in a hostel, three budget meals, two rides on public transportation, one paid visit to a cultural attraction and three cheap beers to tell you how much money you\u2019d need to get by each day. Naturally, a few extra bucks will give you added luxury for an unforgettable trip. All prices are in U.S. dollars.Historic Luang Prabang is the most popular tourist city in Laos, but still remains laid-back compared to other cities in Southeast Asia.

The Ukrainian capital is one of Eastern Europe\u2019s oldest cities, with architectural treasures to match, while its Soviet past adds a completely different dimension. You can visit for $21.14 per day.Off the beaten track and even a little sleepy, the capital of Laos is the place to escape to if you want to kick back, relax and enjoy the views of the Mekong River. According to \u2019s Backpacker Index, you\u2019ll need a daily budget of $19.94, but you can get by on even less if you opt for the local rice wine instead of beer.Nepal\u2019s historic capital is home to Buddhist temples and colourful festivals, but its stunning setting in the Kathmandu Valley makes it a good base for adventure sports, too. A day in Kathmandu will set you back as little as $19.71.Its cool mountain setting, abundance of green spaces and many temples and museums make Chiang Mai a great alternative to frenetic Bangkok or Thailand\u2019s touristy beach destinations. It\u2019s cheap, too, requiring a budget of only $18.84 per day.India\u2019s party island is actually quite expensive compared to many of the country\u2019s lesser known destinations but you can still enjoy the beach lifestyle for $18.48 a day.  says that costs do go up during peak travel times, like around Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve.Officially called Ho Chi Minh City, what was once the capital of South Vietnam is now a bustling, modern city that also has interesting museums and relics from the Vietnam War. Even though it\u2019s one of the most expensive destinations in Vietnam, you can still get by on $18.25 per day, according to .The Vietnamese capital is developing quickly, but still offers a fascinating look into the country\u2019s traditions as well as its French colonial and Communist past. Ancient temples and peaceful parks add to the mix, all for only $17.08 a day.Nepal\u2019s second largest city is a popular base for adventurous spirits wanting to trek in the country\u2019s Annapurna region and also offers temples, museums and spiritual retreats.

To ensure that doesn\u2019t happen to you\xa0the next time you return from a flight, avoid doing these eight things.According to , a sure way of inviting that dreaded delay at customs is to spend more than the allowed duty free amount during your trip.

Alternatively, they can ask for proof that you have enough money to buy that ticket. says that travel from some countries and regions immediately raises suspicion and searches will be more thorough if you return after a visit to one of these areas. This is especially true of countries or regions on the drug routes, such as Central America and South East Asia, or countries with more relaxed drug laws, like The Netherlands.A  AMA with a retired Canadian border security official reveals that previous run-ins with the law, whether it\u2019s a criminal record or past altercations with border officials, may pop up on the customs official\u2019s computer screen. These incidents may make the official feel compelled to take a closer look.According to , simply having a stamp from a certain country in your passport can get you flagged, even if that stamp is several years old. Several countries in the Middle East, for instance, may deny you entry if you have visited Israel before.The website \xa0says that having a bad attitude, such as being disrespectful or smug, can make customs officials more inclined to search you. On a AMA, a retired Canadian border official confirms that you may also raise suspicion if you appear nervous.According to, hiking boots can still carry traces of soil, water or seeds from another country and this can bring alien species into the country you\u2019re entering. For some countries, for example Australia and New Zealand, this is a big issue and you need to declare your boots so they can be cleaned.According to , using your camera or cellphone in the customs processing area can cause officials to confiscate the device.

You see all emotion in that picture,\u201d Colgrove said.This past week after a rough day, French \u2014 who\u2019s been a NICU nurse for three years \u2014\xa0posted the photo\xa0to\xa0Facebook with a\xa0touching\xa0message that\u2019s\xa0been shared 3,000 times.\u201cMany people think [being a NICU nurse]\xa0means feeding and rocking babies, which occasionally I get the privilege to do\u2026 But my job entails so much more,\u201d she\xa0wrote.She said\xa0she sometimes cries on her way home, in the shower or\xa0as she tries to fall asleep.\u201cI beat myself up trying to think what we could have done better or different when all medical options have been exhausted.\u201dShe helps resuscitate babies when their hearts stop. And witnesses miracles.She tells Global News that she definitely thinks about previous patients, whose parents visit the NICU from time to time. The visits can be\xa0bittersweet since the NICU is the only home some babies ever know.A few parents wrote her messages of thanks on the post, crediting her for their child being alive today.Bobbie Whetro wrote that her little girl weighed only 895 grams when she was born three months early. She got up to four pounds after five months and was one of the lucky ones who got to go home.The NICU nurse said she feels undeserving of all the messages and attention because all of her co-workers go through the same thing every single day.She just wrote it (while crying) as a way to cope.Despite all the tough moments, the NICU nurse says what keep her coming back is knowing she\u2019s able to make a difference to so many families.\u201cThere are far more \u2018happy days\u2019 at work,\u201d French said, because \u201cmore babies make it than don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cBut I think it\u2019s important for everyone too see the reality of the NICU.\u201d\u201cUnless you\u2019ve lived it as a parent or NICU staff, you really don\u2019t know what goes on.\u201d', u'Crisis pregnancy centres mislead women, report saysJane was pregnant and she didn\u2019t want to be. She didn\u2019t know\xa0where to go.She was pursuing a graduate degree in Kamloops, B.C., studying for exams last spring when she\xa0discovered she was pregnant.Kamloops has no abortion provider. But Jane did find \xa0\u2014 it promised \u201cconfidential, compassionate assistance and support\u201d for someone facing an unplanned pregnancy and unsure of her options.That assistance didn\u2019t include referrals to abortion providers, or information about getting an abortion.\u201cIt was kind of astounding: There\u2019s no official abortion clinic in Kamloops, however the crisis pregnancy centre did receive\xa0,\u201d she said.She took a pass.The clinic\u2019s executive director Shirley Bosman said in \xa0the centre is \u201cabsolutely\u201d clear up front about its stance on abortion.\u201cWe provide medically factual information\xa0regarding all options available to women, including abortion, adoption and parenting. All Kamloops abortions are\xa0performed at the hospital and require a physician referral,\u201d Bosman wrote.\u201cEvery decision that a woman makes regarding her\xa0unplanned pregnancy is a lifetime decision, whether to abort, parent or place for adoption. . \u2026 It is important that she\xa0is offered the opportunity to explore all her options and be assured that her decision is respected.\u201d\xa0argues the hundreds of crisis pregnancy centres in Canada offer misleading\xa0online advertising that bills them as something they\u2019re not.They style themselves as open, unbiased places where unexpectedly pregnant people can explore their options, the study says, while saying\xa0or implying\xa0that one of those options is a bad idea.Misinformation can make it tough or impossible for people to get the care they need in a timely manner. You only have so many weeks to decide whether you want to terminate a pregnancy.But it can also cement the idea that abortion is a horrible thing no one should talk about, says\xa0.The  reviewed websites for 166 different crisis pregnancy centres across Canada. It argues they\u2019re \u201cdeceptive\u201d in their marketing, \u201cpromote misinformation\u201d\xa0and should be regulated.Sixty per cent of the websites didn\u2019t mention that the centre in question\xa0won\u2019t refer people to abortion providers; 5 per cent claim there\u2019s a link between abortion and breast cancer.Just under half (48 per cent) mentioned negative psychological consequences of terminating a pregnancy, a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder often\xa0referred to as \u201cpost-abortion syndrome,\u201d \u201cwhich is not a medically recognized condition,\u201d the study says.More than two-thirds (68 per cent) of the centres studied are registered charities, the report says.\xa0There are . Many also get direct government funding.\u201cA registered charity must ensure that each health care service or product it provides meets applicable requirements relating to , and ,\u201d Canada Revenue Agency spokesperson David Walters wrote in an email Friday.\u201cWhere a charity furthers a promotion of health purpose through the provision of health information to the public, the information provided must be reasonably unbiased, factual and sufficiently detailed. The onus is on the registered charity to demonstrate how it meets these requirements and how it provides a charitable benefit to the public.\u201dNone is overtly anti-abortion, although\xa0many have disclaimers nested in their websites that they provide peer, not professional counselling, and don\u2019t provide abortion referrals or transportation to abortion providers.\u201cIf these\xa0centres would just help women who want to help their babies, that would be great,\u201d Arthur said.\u201cThey should just be more honest, up front about what they\u2019re doing.\u201dLaura Lewis, , says her members are up front already about what they do and don\u2019t offer.\u201cPart of what really drew me to CAPSS\xa0was their integrity in how they present information,\u201d she said, adding that her group\u2019s members offer \u201caccurate and non-inflammatory\u201d information about options.That includes abortion, she said, even though \u201cwe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the best option for a woman.\u201d As a matter of policy, the Christian organization\u2019s members don\u2019t provide abortions or refer anyone to abortion providers.\u201cWe don\u2019t feel we need to hide that.\u201dLewis says the scientific community \u201chas not agreed\u201d whether abortion increases your risk of breast cancer.(The  \u201cinduced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.\u201d)As for \u201cpost-abortion syndrome,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cpost-abortion grief\u201d is a real thing.These centres don\u2019t give women any help obtaining an abortion or contraceptive care because they can get that elsewhere, Lewis said.That\u2019s one of the reasons her organization exists.Jane\xa0begs to differ.Calls to clinics across the province, thousands of dollars,\xa0trips\xa0by rental car and ferry later, she\xa0terminated her pregnancy. It\u2019s been just over a year but she\u2019s still furious at the ordeal she went through to obtain public health care.Jane\xa0knows she was lucky to have had the resources and wherewithal to get the care she needed.What\u2019s needed most, she and Arthur argue, is easily accessible, comprehensive abortion and reproductive care information from reliable sources\xa0\u2014 provincial and federal governments, for example.That way there wouldn\u2019t be a vacuum of information for potentially misleading organizations to fill.\u201cThe government needs to start providing sufficient\xa0information,\u201d\xa0Jane said.', u'Tips for cutting costs on your wedding without sacrificing qualityCouples are spending way more money on tying the knot\xa0than they set out to, a new TD survey has found.They\u2019re blowing over their wedding budget, on average, by a whopping 55 per cent.Toronto-based wedding planner  notes it can happen very\xa0easily. Not having a realistic idea\xa0of what a wedding can cost is usually\xa0to blame.She gets clients in all the time who come to her with budgets based on what they \u201cthink\u201d they should spend, rather than what things actually cost.Nearly a quarter of couples don\u2019t even know what they paid for their reception, according to the survey.What\u2019s more, one in five millennials admitted it\xa0landed them in debt. Four in 10 confessed it caused\xa0friction in their relationship.Decor, food and attire tend to eat\xa0up the biggest chunk of the budget, Wisesaid.Here are her top money-saving tips to keep\xa0couples from going broke for their big day.The flower selection\xa0may vary across the country so ask\xa0your local florist what your best options would be for the month you\u2019re getting married.And if you\u2019re really dying to have a certain flower (but don\u2019t want to pay to import\xa0them if they\u2019re not in season), you may want to consider picking your wedding date accordingly.If your floral budget is smaller, know that you\u2019ll likely end up with more green in the arrangements, which is golden if you choose that as one of your colours.Before you go all Pinterest-crazy with centerpiece ideas, know that what you see on there can be quite costly.Wise recommends putting elaborate and tall floral\xa0centerpieces on every other table, and simple low centerpieces (that can be a smattering of different-sized candles) on the rest.Candles are also pretty cheap. Just make sure to check the burn time so they don\u2019t go out during your reception.The little white lights are quite inexpensive, as well.But they can make a room look magical.She suggests buying them online and getting your groomsmen to hang them up.This tip will help save you cash \u2014 and the environment.For those doing a sit-down dinner, you don\u2019t need to print menus for everyone. Place a couple on the table instead.The programs can be cut out too, Wise said, unless you have a really unique DIY idea for them. People will figure out what\u2019s going on.If you\u2019re really worried they won\u2019t, you could write out a breakdown at the entrance.Or just include the details on your wedding website.Another thing to save for your site: maps and rehearsal dinner details that would otherwise be printed on\xa0an insert in your invitation.Speaking of invitations\xa0\u2014\xa0Wise said it\u2019s totally fine to do electronic\xa0versions of save-the-dates, but prefers paper\xa0for the actual invite.Those who don\u2019t care to go too fancy can still\xa0save costs there, she added, by keeping it to one page. Sticking to the standard 5\xd77 size helps, too.Opt for a\xa0reduced bar during cocktail hour by serving only beer and wine or a signature cocktail.That means no pre-reception shots, which may help things flow more smoothly.Others eliminate shots from their bar altogether.Food stations at cocktail weddings are a big thing now that let you save a bit on\xa0furniture rentals and decor. But they can still\xa0end up being more expensive than a sit-down dinner, according to Wise.If you want to do a food station, pick one that\u2019s meaningful to the two of you\xa0\u2014 like a taco stand if you fell in love over tacos or if that\u2019s your favourite go-to date-night food.Be aware that food is probably going to be your\xa0biggest spend.Another one of Wise\u2019s trade secrets: rent\xa0a cake pedestal to increase the height of your cake without increasing the price.Cupcakes can also be an easier cost to swallow. After all, who really remembers eating the cake?This will make the biggest difference to your food and beverage bottom line.Avoid inviting your \u201cB\u201d-list to just your ceremony or dance portion of the reception, Wise said, unless they\u2019re someone you know will be totally cool with knowing they\u2019re on your B-list.Sample sales and trunk shows can shave hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars off your dress.So make sure to do your research and shop around.Some women even order\xa0coloured gowns in white to avoid the often-steep prices of traditional bridal gowns.Veils are pricey and usually only worn during the ceremony, so why not borrow one from an already-married friend?Accessories\xa0can also count as \u201csomething borrowed\u201d while keeping costs down.A\xa0groom may want to consider renting a tuxedo or suit instead of buying new. They can also borrow a buddy\u2019s cufflinks.Brides-to-be in Ontario\xa0may benefit from the  on Facebook. It\u2019s a platform for women to trade wedding-related items.One newlywed recently\xa0asked for gift cards, parkas or alcohol in exchange for\xa0her size 8 \u201cone-of-a-kind Alfred Angelo bridal grown.\u201d She even offered to throw in her \u201cblingy belt and veil.\u201d And she has matching heels.Not a bad deal. See if there are any similar groups in your area.The most important area you don\u2019t want to cheap out on is on documenting your wedding.After all the months of planning and money spent, you\u2019ll want\xa0a photographer (and possibly a videographer)\xa0who can capture the magic of the day.Skip the album, she advised, though. It\u2019s usually pricey and you can make your own online.If you or your friends are tech-savvy you can also just ask for the raw footage from your videographer and cut your video yourself.', u'NYC student who ran rogue eatery in his dorm trying to find post-grad pathNEW YORK \u2013 As a student at Columbia University, Jonah Reider wowed foodies and rankled city health officials by opening an exclusive supper club in his dorm.His culinary chutzpah, and the long waiting list for a seat at one of his unorthodox dinners, earned him write-ups in newspapers and magazines and even an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert.But after graduating this week, the 22-year-old whiz chef from Newton, Massachusetts, is facing the same reality as a lot of other new college grads.He\u2019s looking for a place to live and a way to make a living.Four months after leaving his dorm, Reider is being booted from the Columbia-owned apartment where he hosted the latest incarnation of his supper club. His eviction comes amid pressure from the university and city health officials, who said he was operating a restaurant under the radar of food inspectors.\u201cI don\u2019t mind if I live in a squalid little New York apartment,\u201d Reider says, adding that he has just one requirement: \u201ca nice kitchen.\u201dHis goal is to earn a living staging \u201cwild, crazy events\u201d for companies including, perhaps, fashion houses and hotels.A few gigs already have started to materialize.This week, a day before he graduated, the economics and sociology major cooked up his \u201cexperimental cuisine\u201d for 90 guests who gathered at a Fifth Avenue mansion for an evening of music with Grammy-nominated conductor Andrew Cyr and the Metropolis Ensemble. His dishes included whipped bone marrow with watermelon radish and fennel, and raw scallops with pink lemon, charred ramp oil, rhubarb and black salt.He\u2019s also lined up to film a web series, appear at a Chicago cooking conference and prepare a series of meals at a Manhattan art gallery, with visitors helping to choose and mix ingredients amid artful ceramics and furniture.Reider\u2019s cooking career started when he and his friends at Newton South High School formed a grilling club. He had no formal training in cooking last September when he started his Columbia dorm supper club, which he called , for the white outer part of an orange or lemon.With a mere four seats around one table and reservations available only online, Pith had no choice but to start small. But after one news outlet dubbed it \u201cNew York\u2019s hottest new restaurant,\u201d the waiting list quickly grew to thousands of wannabe guests.For his last semester, Reider moved into a Columbia-owned apartment. He had a lease through August, but recently got a letter terminating his lease at the end of this month. Reider contended he made no money from the supper club, asking diners only to chip in about $15 toward groceries. Columbia officials declined to comment.Others haven\u2019t hesitated to heap praise.\u201cThat is fantastic,\u201d exclaimed Colbert last year on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d after biting into a honey-filled phyllo dough dessert infused with black truffle. \u201cThat is delicious, unexpected.\u201dFamed food critic Ruth Reichl, who attended one of Reider\u2019s meals at a mutual friend\u2019s house, later blogged that she found his fare \u201cimpossible to stop eating.\u201d And The New York Times named him one of its \u201c30 under 30\u201d creative achievers.As for what the future holds, Reider says he has no regrets about breaking from most of his Ivy League classmates and choosing an unconventional path.\u201cI don\u2019t really care,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about the cooking and the people I\u2019m meeting.\u201d\xa0', u'Will saunas at Burger King and booze at Taco Bell attract new customers?Burger King famously serves food \u201cyour way, right away\u201d and apparently that means serving up a Whopper and fries inside a sauna.An outlet in Helsinki, Finland is heating up the burger world by offering in-store spa services and allowing patrons to take their burgers fresh from the flame grill and into the steam.The restaurant reportedly offers patrons robes and towels, adorned with Burger King logos, of course, and provides TV and video games in one of two saunas in the establishment.As , the novelty is actually an  by Finnish designer Teuvo Loman \u2014 and that it\u2019s not that much of a stretch in a country that has \u201cone sauna for every three people.\u201dBut, gimmick or not, it follows a trend in fast food chains aiming to rise above the image of being nothing more than greasy food at an affordable price.Several chains have taken to offering alcohol in some establishments \u2014 including Taco Bell.But the home of the  is following on the heels of its \u201cfast-casual\u201d rival Chipotle, which has long offered alcoholic beverages with it burritos and bowls.Taco Bell said the move towards serving booze caters to the lifestyle of And that means beer, , sangria and \u201ctwisted Freezers\u201d \u2014 colourful, spiked slushy drinks \u2014 to go with \u201ctapas style\u201d munchies.Taco Bell\u2019s fast-and-fancier food, doesn\u2019t stop there: the company announced Tuesday four more restaurant concepts meant to appeal to \u201c.\u201dBut some business analysts say fast food chains should just do a better job with the food they already serve, rather than introducing trend-inspired pops and buzzes.\u201cInstead of putting time, effort, and money into a more upscale dining atmosphere, fast food chains should think of ways to add more flavor to their menu,\u201d wrote Madeleine Johnson, of . \u201cThese food items are not fine dining cuisine. No architecture or color scheme is going to diminish that crucial fact. And that\u2019s ok.\u201dShe pins the style stunts on something called the \u201cfast-casual effect\u201d \u2014 the popularity of so-called fast-casual restaurants that sell seemingly healthier items, compared to traditional fast food, but are still a few steps down from fine dining.Fast-casual food has found its base among  \u2014 those born between the early 1980s and late 1990s \u2014 and become a formidable entry into the food world.According to the , fast-casual food racked up $39 billion in U.S. sales in 2014, but that number is estimated to rocket up to $62 billion by 2019.', u'Tax credit to offer incentive to NS farmers donating produce to food banksRustic wooden crates filled with apples and onions and baskets overflowing with fresh produce graced the Feed Nova Scotia warehouse in Bedford, Nova Scotia Thursday.They were donated by various local farmers upon the announcement of the impending approval of the new provincial The credit, which has been in the works for a few years, is aimed at providing greater tax relief to farmers who donate surplus produce to food banks.Food banks will be able to issue a tax receipt to farmers that is equal to 25 per cent of the value of the donation received. Donations will also remain eligible for the Charitable Donation Tax Credit.Chris van den Heuvel, president of the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture, says the tax credit will not only benefit farmers, but it will also help the food banks meet an .On average, nearly 44,000 Nova Scotians visit a food bank at least once during the year.Agriculture Minister Keith Colwell commended the new tax credit for its support of farmers who have continually made large contributions to food banks through the years.\u201cThis is fantastic news for Nova Scotia, it\u2019s fantastic news for the farmers of the province that have donated so much food to the food bank for such a long time. But most importantly, it\u2019s important to the people in the community that need to come to the food bank,\u201d he said.According to van den Heuvel, in the past year Nova Scotia\u2019s farmers donated over 149,000 kilograms of produce to food banks.Nick Jennery, the executive director of Feed Nova Scotia, sees this tax credit as a means to help people give back to their community.Once the credit is approved, it can be applied to any donations made by farmers from January 1, 2016 onward.Colwell says the details of the tax credit are in the process of being approved, and once finalized the credit would be implemented in a few days.', u'It\u2019s not just a paycheque: Finding happiness through employmentWork-life balance is more than just a buzzy term: a new Ipsos poll finds a significant percentage of people think a new career can lead to improved\xa0overall\xa0well-being.\u201cA strong 45 per cent said getting a new job or career would help their personal well-being,\u201d said Jennifer\xa0McLeod Macey, a vice president\xa0of public affairs with\xa0Ipsos\u2019 and a lead of its Health Research Institute.Unemployment and jobs have overtaken healthcare at the top of\xa0priority lists for Canadians, McLeod Macey added, a shift that\u2019s largely\xa0sparked by Canada\u2019s oilsands taking a hit and the ensuing economic challenges.This holds true in Alberta as well as in Ontario, where half of the province\u2019s residents agreed they would be happier with a job change.\u201cPersonal well-being is so much more than physical health and mental health, this goes to show that.\u201d \t\t\t\n\t\tThe numbers of those who think that shifting jobs will improve well-being were particularly high among those in lower income brackets and Millennials.\u201cIt\u2019s significantly higher among those at the\xa0lower income [level]\u2026 unhappy with finances overall, thinking that better job would help with that, a better paying job,\u201d said McLeod Macey.People in higher income brackets were more likely to respond that a better sex life or weight loss would improve their overall well-being.From being in a rut, to personal growth or to making more money, there are many motivators to wanting or needing a new job.\u201cPeople experience their challenges and barriers in different ways; tied back to their strengths and their life situations and expertise, gifts they have or are missing,\u201d said Robin Swets, certified life coach with  in Victoria, B.C.Some people lack challenge in their role; others simply\xa0never settled in one position for long \u2013\xa0Swets calls them \u201cenvelope pushers.\u201d\u201cIt depends on what drives people. Some people are more happy at the front end of a situation where they are innovating, creating something. Other people are happier maintaining an existing system, drilling down into the details. So it depends on the person\u2019s learning style and work style. And ultimately their personality.\u201dSwet says people need to not be frozen by fear of change, and work to drive themselves to see it as an opportunity.\u201cPeople will always be unsettled in change\u2026 felt by some people more than others.\u201dHe recommends having an accountability partner to help maintain a feeling of control while taking the leap.Passion and fulfillment are just as important as compensation supporting the lifestyle people desire.\u201cAt the end of the day, are you feeling fulfilled, are you feeling connected? Is there meaning in your everyday work? I think those kinds of things are basic human needs in relation to their careers and typically people feel engaged and passionate about their work when those factors are met.\u201dWorkplaces need to understand the whole of their employees,\xa0McLeod Macey added.\u201cPeople are juggling quite a bit. Life is not as easy as it used to be \u2013\xa0more difficult than ever before.\u201cI hope people understand the complexity of what goes into happiness and well-being. There is more to it.

When oil prices took a dive, so did profit margins. New exploration was reduced, and Nicol was soon part of the shrinking industry\u2019s carnage.The job search is tough: Over the past two years, he\u2019s seen about 10 Canadian postings related to his field. Each gets 500 to 1,000 applications, he said.But like many of his now-former co-workers, he\u2019s decided to diversify.Nicol has put in about 500 hours since January into studying for his first chartered financial analyst exam in June. He doesn\u2019t have any financial experience but finds it interesting. Plus he figures it\u2019ll be good knowledge to have if ever he\u2019s able to get back into geophysics since he\u2019ll know how to invest his money.While he re-tools he\u2019s working part-time at \xa0the Heart and Stroke Foundation.

There are more people\xa0on EI in Alberta now than any time since 1997, including the height of the recession.The vast majority of Albertans and East Coast Canadians (86 and 88 per cent, respectively) rank a stronger economy third in terms of what they think would improve their personal well-being \u2014 right after getting more sleep and eating better.An economic uplift ranks fourth on the national wishlist, with 78 per cent citing it as something that could make them feel better about life.

Inspired by his favourite Italian dish, , Chell set out to create a drink\xa0that would capture the pasta\u2019s hearty clam and tomato flavours.Eventually, he came up with\xa0: vodka mixed with clam-infused tomato juice, lime, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce\xa0served in\xa0a cup with a delicious celery salt rim.How exactly did Chell decide to use clam juice in\xa0his\xa0sipper?Turns out he may have been inspired by a historical cookbook.As Michael Platt notes in an , a 1900 copy of  contains a recipe for a sea-spiked cocktail, as does a 1951 Betty Crocker cookbook.\xa0Soon after the appearance of Chell\u2019s creation at the inn, Mott\u2019s beverage company released what is arguably the world\u2019s best-known clam-infused tomato juice, Clamato.This made it easier for people to create the Caesar at-home.According to an Ipsos-Reid poll commissioned by the company in 2009, the Caesar, or Bloody Caesar, is now the most popular cocktail in Canada; Mott\u2019s estimates that more than 350 million are consumed each\xa0year.Beyond the occasional American article praising the \u201cCanadian Bloody Mary,\u201d Chell\u2019s heady blend of sweet, salty, sour, spicy and bitter notes hasn\u2019t gotten much love beyond our borders. reflect international influences, substituting or enhancing British Worcestershire sauce with horseradish, wasabi, kimchi, chipotle, sriracha, teriyaki, tandoori, jerk spice, Dijon mustard or any number of multicultural flavours.A staple at  celebrations and weekend , and a drink as red as our\xa0flag, the Caesar is a cocktail\xa0that can rightly claim that it came, it quenched, and it conquered\xa0the country.', u'Google plans to compete with Amazon Echo with new \u2018Home\u2019 deviceMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2013  wants to play an even bigger role in managing people\u2019s daily lives, while also nudging them into an alternate reality, as the Internet company responds to competitive threats posed by Facebook, Amazon and Apple.As part of an onslaught of upcoming products, Google will implant a more personable form of artificial intelligence into an Internet-connected device called Home, which echoes the Echo, Amazon.com\u2019s trendy smart-home speaker.Meanwhile, Google will also delve deeper into the still-nascent realm of virtual reality with a system called Daydream that\u2019s meant to challenge Facebook-owned Oculus\u2019s early lead in fabricating artificial worlds.In an attempt to outshine Apple, Google is also adding features to its Android operating system, including the ability to run apps without actually installing them on a device.That feature, called Instant Apps, might have been the biggest breakthrough that Google announced Wednesday at its annual developers conference held in an amphitheatre located a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters.It\u2019s the first time that Google has held the conference in its hometown since the inaugural event in 2006. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told a crowd of more than 7,000 people that he wanted to move the conference from San Francisco back to Mountain View to underscore a \u201cpivotal moment in terms of where the company is going.\u201dInstant Apps is Google\u2019s answer to the pain of installing phone apps you know you\u2019ll use just once or twice, for shopping or booking a parking spot, for example. With this approach, the app runs on Google\u2019s servers instead of your phone. Only the parts you need are sent to your phone on an as-needed basis.There will also be a new chat service called Allo that\u2019s designed to counter Facebook\u2019s Messenger app and WhatsApp. Allo will draw upon a vast database that Google has built through its dominant Internet search engine to predict how you might want to respond to a text and automatically fetch links to video clips and other information that seem relevant to an ongoing conversation.Although the upcoming products will offer some unique features, they mostly painted a picture of a company scrambling to catch up with its rivals.Google Home, for instance, will mostly do the same things already performed by the Echo, a cylinder-like speaker that Amazon released last year. The Echo responds to voice commands to play music, read books, answer questions and manage calendars. It also turns off the lights, hails Uber rides and keeps adding new tasks as programmers build more apps for it.Not surprisingly, Google touted its Home speaker as a more intelligent and versatile device, mostly because it can tap into the same stockpile of information that makes Google\u2019s Internet search place so popular. Google also has redesigned its virtual assistant to be more conversational and intuitive. It will be the voice and brains inside Google Home.Although it is meant to be more personal than the automated voice that Google currently uses to respond to spoken requests on smartphones and computers, the company is simply calling it \u201cAssistant.\u201d That contrasts with the human names given to other virtual assistants from Amazon (Alexa), Apple (Siri) and Microsoft (Cortana).Google didn\u2019t reveal a price for the Home device, though it presumably will be competitive with the Echo, which sells for $180. Even if Home proves to be superior to the Echo, Gartner analyst Brian Blau thinks Google will be hard-pressed to surpass Amazon in the category. Amazon\u2019s leadership in e-commerce means it Echo \u201ccan always be on the front-page of Amazon\u2019s site and that is going to make it difficult for any rival to catch up,\u201d Blau said.Daydream is a new virtual reality ecosystem that will be made available to all comers, duplicating a strategy that worked well for Google after it fell behind Apple following the iPhone\u2019s debut nearly a decade ago.To get the ball rolling, Google will sell a virtual-reality headset with a wireless motion controller expected to carry the Nexus brand that the company original created as a showcase for its Android operating system for smartphones. Google didn\u2019t announce the price for the VR headset at Wednesday\u2019s conference, nor did it specify when it will hit the market. A similar headset, the Gear VR, made by Samsung and powered by Facebook\u2019s Oculus subsidiary, costs $100.Consumers will need a new smartphone to power the headset. It is going to be tethered to the \u201cN\u201d version of Android that Google plans to release later this year and requires more processing power and sensors unavailable in any phone already out.The new headset marks a major upgrade from Google\u2019s initial foray into VR in 2014, a cheap model made out of cardboard that sells for as little as $15 and is even given away in sales promotions by some companies.Google\u2019s new VR headset won\u2019t be as sophisticated as the recently released Rift from Oculus, which costs $600 and must be tethered to computers that can cost another $1,000 or so. Oculus spent several years perfecting the Rift, which features technology that looks so revolutionary that Facebook paid $2 billion to buy the startup in 2014.Google is now part of a larger holding company known as Alphabet Inc.', u'Joking about rape: how a comedy tour is helping sex assault survivorsCan rape jokes ever be funny? Canadian stand-up comics who\u2019ve been sexually assaulted are banking on it.The \xa0is\xa0\u201ctwo hours of rape talk\u201d by rape survivors,\xa0as 26-year-old Heather Jordan Ross put it.She and co-producer\xa0Emma Cooper came up with the idea over beers last November, after\xa0Ross vented\xa0about her own rape ordeal.She\u2019d managed to repress it for a year-and-a-half, even though she\u2019d left her co-worker\u2019s\xa0house bleeding. It wasn\u2019t until he contacted her on Facebook that she fully realized what had really happened.As the women commiserated, they asked themselves: \u201c\u201dPeople\xa0talk at length about trivial things like car dents but struggle to open\xa0up\xa0about serious issues like\xa0rape, Ross pointed out.The two women found\xa0seasoned\xa0comedians able to joke about their sex assaults. And a cross-country tour was born.It launched\xa0in B.C. this week, with each stop featuring local talent.Ross hopes they\xa0can help break\xa0the silence\xa0that makes the topic so\xa0taboo. She figures staying silent\xa0only\xa0makes for \u201can easier world for your rapist to live in.\u201dPlus\xa0sometimes laughter really is the best medicine.That\u2019s a taste of what you can expect from her no-holds-barred set, which took her three weeks to pull together.Some audiences might find it a little weird to laugh at the material\xa0at first, Ross admitted. But\xa0\u201cwe want people to laugh, we want people to talk about this.\u201dPretty much every city features a male rape survivor. Because it\u2019s not just women who can be sexually assaulted \u2014 that\u2019s another\xa0stigma Ross\xa0wants the tour\xa0to shatter.While\xa0men are statistically more likely to commit sexual assault,  shows they\u2019re also at the receiving end of it.Ross believes\xa0societal\xa0pressure for masculinity can make it even more challenging for men\xa0to come forward. They\u2019re \u201cnot supposed to be vulnerable ever,\u201d she said.The other issue is understanding\xa0exactly what rape is. Thirty-year-old Cooper admitted her friends had to explain to\xa0her she\u2019d been\xa0sexually assaulted.She was with someone she\u2019d just met, when he reportedly took the condom off during sex without telling her (that\u2019s a lack of consent).\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunately a pretty common thing that happens to people,\u201d Cooper said.Ross reported her former co-worker, who claimed not to remember anything.For her\xa0and others on the tour, using humour to deal with the trauma has been immensely cathartic.There are those, of course, who\u2019ve argued over the years that rape jokes are never appropriate.Ross thinks\xa0it\u2019s all in how you do it.\u201cUsually it\u2019s boneheads making the jokes,\u201d she said, adding that it\xa0helps to have skilled comedians who can bring something new to the conversation.\u201cThen not only are you funny and engaging, but you\u2019re doing something for survivors.\u201dTheir first show was full of them.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a handful of people say no rape\u2019s never funny. Don\u2019t do this. And that\u2019s fine.

This man. This husband and partner and father.\u201cHe was so patient and so loving and so strong with our tiny son in his lap.

It was not surprising or anything out of the ordinary; it\u2019s how he has always been with the kids.\u201dHowever, when the photographer posted the image on Facebook, the social media site removed it on several occasions in an apparent violation of its policy on photographs. Whitten re-shared the image on May 2 with the story behind the image after the social media site re-instated it.Whitten explained to  that she did an interview with a photography blog and discussed how the photo was misunderstood.\u201cI wanted to take it down just because I thought it would get blown out of proportion,\u201d Whitten said. \u201cI thought the point was getting missed.\u201dThe image and her story had been shared nearly 33,000 times and has received over 140,000 likes.\u201cI was taken aback by how many people missed the story or didn\u2019t even look past the nudity to find the story,\u201d the photographer wrote on Facebook. \u201cThey were just hung up on them both being nude and being in the shower.

And a third would pay up to $500 for a week\u2019s worth of proper rest.\u201cThey\u2019re feeling a bit sleep deprived,\u201d said Canadian sleep expert Rachel Morehouse, a psychiatry professor at Dalhousie University.Morehouse was the lead panelist on the review, which saw just\xa0over\xa01,500 people across the country surveyed about their sleep habits this month.The Dairy Farmers of Canada commissioned the  survey and\xa0 site, as part of the group\u2019s effort to build awareness about serious lifestyle\xa0issues.Sleep deprivation can have major effects on both your mind and body, according to Morehouse.In the short-term, she\xa0said it can cause problems with mental health. It might make people more impatient, anxious, sad, and difficult to get along with.It can also hinder their productivity at school or in the workplace, as tiredness makes memory retention a challenge.Over time fatigue can take a toll on your physical health, as well.\xa0Morehouse said it\xa0contributes to problems like high blood pressure, Type 2 Diabetes and heart disease.It can have wreak havoc\xa0on your waistline too. Those\xa0who sleep fewer\xa0than six hours a night are 30 per cent more likely to become obese than someone who sleeps seven to nine hours, research shows.There are two main types of people: night owls and so-called morning larks. The latter\xa0are the early-to-bed, early-to-rise types.Morehouse believes\xa0they could benefit from an hour-long nap during the day, a workout in the evening (to help give them a little energy), and low to no light in the bedroom.Night owls, who have a hard time getting up and going to bed at a \u201creasonable hour,\u201d would benefit from low light in the evenings and bright light in the mornings.That can\xa0cue melatonin to either knock them out at night or give them a wake-up jolt in the morning, Morehouse explains.She recommends they avoid activities like exercise or video games late in the evening and\xa0naps.\u201cWe\u2019re creatures of habit so it\u2019s good to have a set bedtime and wake-up time.\u201dThat ideally means on weekends as well. Otherwise your sleep cycle will be thrown off and you\u2019ll start your workweek sleep deprived, Morehouse said.\u201cWe all have competing priorities but sleep needs to be up there on the list,\u201d said Morehouse. \u201cIt should not be the last thing on the priority list.\u201dIt should be one of the first, she added.Here are some of the highlights from the sleep survey:\xa0\xa0', u"How to have a baby: Fertility clinic founders share 5 dos and don\u2019tsWomen can\xa0spend years avoiding getting pregnant. Then when they\u2019re ready to have kids, one in six Canadian couples can\u2019t conceive.\u201cI have mainly women in my office who say, \u2018Nobody told me it could be difficult,'\u201d said Marjorie Dixon, founder of the\xa0\xa0clinic in Toronto.Coinciding with Canada\u2019s Infertility Awareness Week, currently underway, we asked her and Al Yuzpe of Vancouver\u2019s \xa0to\xa0share some\xa0baby-making best practices.Step One tip is simple: Have lots of sex (at least three times a week).But you can skip the acrobatics. When it comes to conception, position doesn\u2019t matter.\u201cPutting your legs up on a pillow after\xa0\u2014 none of that does anything,\u201d Dixon said.You don\u2019t have to wait \u2019til you know you\u2019re having trouble before testing your fertility, Dixon says.She thinks anyone who wants to have kids\xa0\u2014 at any point in life \u2014 should incorporate this into their annual check-up so there are no surprises when it comes time to trying.Your\xa0family doctor can refer you. Fertility assessments are covered across the country.Men ejaculate into a cup and get the quantity and quality of their sperm analyzed.Women can get a pelvic X-Ray or ultrasound that checks for abnormalities in the uterus and to make sure the Fallopian tubes are open.You can also get a blood test on Day 3 of your cycle to determine levels of follicle stimulating hormone, which shows how well your ovaries are functioning.Another test, for anti-mullerian hormone, estimates the number of eggs in your ovaries. That one isn\u2019t covered by health care.If your periods are like clockwork, Yuzpe says there\u2019s a 98 per cent chance you\u2019re ovulating each month. There are ways to confirm ovulation is happening, including a blood test (performed around Day 21 of your cycle) and kits you can purchase from the drug store.The average cycle length is\xa028 days. If your menstruation\u2019s all over the map, or if there\u2019s spotting,\xa0it could mean your ovulation is irregular or your egg reserve is diminishing. So it\u2019s important to pay attention to what\u2019s going on down there.\u201cIt\u2019s about knowing your body,\u201d Dixon said, adding that there are tons of period-tracking apps out there that can help.There\u2019s no strong evidence supplements can help you get pregnant.Unless you\u2019re deficient in Vitamin D, Yuzpe figures prenatal vitamins are the most important supplement women trying to conceive should take.Dixon still recommends the following supplements for women:Being too heavy or too lean isn\u2019t good for your fertility or your pregnancy.Women who are underweight may not be ovulating at all, Dixon explained. And the risk of miscarriage is higher for women who are overweight, Yuzpe said.The ideal\xa0BMI for conception, according to both of them, is\xa0between\xa019 and\xa025.Dixon recommends five days a week of exercise, with 30 minutes of daily aerobic fitness.\u201cBlood flow to everywhere is blood flow to your pelvis too.\u201dWhile there\u2019s \u201cno magic fertility food,\u201d Dixon and other health experts emphasize the importance of eating well.Studies have shown high insulin levels can throw off ovulation, said nutritionist Vanessa Perrone. So avoid too much sugar.Reach instead, she said, for slow-digesting carbs like whole-grains, as well as\xa0beans, lentils, chick peas and antioxidant-rich leafy greens. might also make a difference.Lose the lubricant if you can, the World Health Organization\xa0says: Some types may be too viscous for sperm to swim through. If you do need it, use lube that\u2019s water-based and doesn\u2019t contain spermicide. WHO recommends Pre-Seed Lubricant, which isn\u2019t supposed to interfere with sperm function.This one\u2019s a big no-no. Dixon said she won\u2019t even do an IVF cycle on a smoker unless she\u2019s stopped for three months. There\u2019s evidence that toxins from cigarettes diminish egg quality, Yuzpe said. Dixon also said marijuana does to sperm\xa0\u201cwhat it does to you \u2013 slows\xa0them down.\u201d Same thing with cigarettes for men.. Some women\xa0even  when they\u2019re\xa0stressed, science\xa0suggests.Laughter, on the other hand, has been\xa0shown\xa0to help\xa0boost your pregnancy prospects.The doctor behind a 2006\xa0study said \u201che knew fertility patients became stressed \u2013 and that .\u201d\xa0So he sent in clowns to entertain women after they underwent IVF.Those who received the comic relief became pregnant roughly 15 per cent more often than the control group.Excessive sweating and \xa0isn\u2019t great for fertility, Dixon cautions.A small Finnish study in 2013 found\xa0. While the effect wasn\u2019t permanent, Dixon still\xa0tells men that if they\u2019re worried about their swimmers, they may want to skip\xa0the steam showers, hot baths and\xa0hot tubs.\u201cYou can say: \u2018Well, my mother is French and she drank.\u2019 I don\u2019t care. Now we understand that it\u2019s associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and we don\u2019t know what amount is safe so we just say none.\u201dThe biggest predictor of fertility is how old a woman is, since women\u2019s egg quality and quantity decreases over time.One Irish study even suggested that a woman has lost up to 90 per cent of her eggs by the time she\u2019s 30.\u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you can say: \u2018My friend smokes and drinks and she got pregnant,'\u201d Dixon said. \u201cWell yeah, some people get lucky.\u201d", u'France wants to allow couples to get a divorce without a judgePARIS \u2013 The French government plans to allow divorce by mutual consent to proceed without a judge, to simplify and accelerate the process.Details are to be discussed at the lower house of parliament during a debate starting Tuesday on a bill to modernize the country\u2019s justice system.Family associations expressed fears that the best interests of children would not be protected enough.Justice minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas said the process would cost about 50 euros ($56) at the notary office.

It\u2019s not just on the border. This is Fort McMurray burning,\u201d Global National reporter Reid Fiest said during a live broadcast during the mass evacuation on Tuesday, May 3.Shortly after that live hit showing fire consuming nearby trees, our crew had to pack up and flee town, along with tens of thousands of residents.It astonishes us how many residents of Fort McMurray stopped to share their stories with grace and courage. So many strangers helped our crews along the way and without them, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to continue our coverage.No small gesture has gone unnoticed, so we put together the video in the player above above to express our gratitude.\u201cThere\u2019s so many people I want to thank, including a woman, she offered us her home so we could sleep hours after the fire broke out and we fled,\u201d Fiest described.\u201cThose few hours of sleep and the food that she so graciously shared with us, it made all the difference in the world to us, the crew,\u201d said Global Edmonton reporter Fletcher Kent.In the days to come, complete strangers stopped to lend a helping hand.\u201cI want to give a big shout out to the boys in Conklin who helped us change our flat tire, and to Gary from Winnipeg who gave us some gas on the side of the road when we needed it,\u201d cameraman Cliff Harris said.We also want to thank law enforcement and first responders who helped us cover the story.\u201cThanks to the RCMP officer who pulled me over when I was racing up here on the weekend,\u201d anchor Shaye Ganam said. \u201cHe gave me a lecture, instead of a ticket.\u201dThe last word goes to cameraman Dean Twardzik, who summed it all with a simple, \u201cThank you.\u201d', u'Could mobile payments lead you to overspend? How to keep your budget in checkGoing to the store armed with a wallet full of debit and credit cards may soon be a thing of the past \u2013 at least, that\u2019s what the country\u2019s biggest banks are betting on.This week, the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions announced they had signed on to make Apple Pay \u2013  \u2013 available to debit and credit card holders, marking a big step for Canada\u2019s adoption of mobile payment technology.But while banks are selling mobile payments as a convenient and fast solution for consumers, financial experts warn there could be one big risk associated with digital wallets \u2013 overspending.\u201cThe move to digital wallets is another step removed from tangibility,\u201d said Jeff Berry, senior director of research and development at LoyaltyOne.\u201cAs consumers become more and more removed from cash transactions, the amount they spend tends to rise so we can expect to see an increase in spending among those who adopt Apple Pay.\u201dIt\u2019s the same warning we\u2019ve heard over and over again when it comes to credit cards \u2013 the less we use cash, the harder it is to keep track of what we are actually spending.But some experts say we could become even more reckless with overspending once those credit cards are stored on our smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s been suggested that we reach for our wallets and purses far less often than we reach for our phones, with some data showing smartphone users reach for their devices over 100 times per day,\u201d personal finance expert Preet Banerjee told Global News.This is especially concerning considering  have hit new highs in recent times To prevent this, Banerjee said consumers need to get back to what he calls \u201cpersonal finance 101\u201d \u2013 keeping a monthly budget.\u201cGone are the days where you would have to track all your paper receipts and bills to create a good record of your expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve figured out your monthly expenses you can get a better sense of how you are spending your money and where you want to make changes.\u201dThe good news is, most mobile wallet apps allow you to see your transaction history quite easily, which means \u2013 if you are diligent \u2013 you can gain a good sense of how much is being drained from your digital wallet.Another saving grace: Apple Pay and contactless payments (tap-to-pay debit and credit cards) are limited to transactions under $100. Although this is done for security and fraud prevention reasons, it also prevents you from mindlessly tapping away on big purchases.You may be more inclined to think twice about your purchase if you have to take the time to punch in your PIN.Experts also suggest downloading a budgeting app to help keep track of your spending habits. If you do notice your day-to-day spending is out of control, Banerjee said you might be better off shutting down your digital wallet, leaving your credit cards at home, or using cash to see how much you are actually spending.While setting and sticking to a budget is your responsibility, some experts believe banks and app makers should play a part in preventing the growth of consumer debt.\u201cI am a firm believer of consumers taking responsibility for their actions; however, having said that, they still need to have mechanisms in place that if they feel they are out of control of their spending that they have help,\u201d said Jeffrey Schwartz, executive director of For example, Schwartz suggested Apple could build in a feature to Apple Pay that allows the user to set a monthly budget for the cards they store in their digital wallet.', u'Does Sophie Gr\xe9goire Trudeau need extra help? Outrage indicates deeper problem, prof says, wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, wants some help.The Prime Minister\u2019s Office is considering getting her a second publicly-funded assistant. They won\u2019t say what specifically her duties entail, although an official statement\xa0refers to her \u201cextraordinarily high volume of correspondence and invitations.\u201dBut people responding this week weren\u2019t waiting for details: They were outraged.New Democrat Niki Ashton said it shows how out of touch the governing Liberals are with the daily\xa0struggles of\xa0working women today.\u201cCertainly the kind of statements we heard from the prime minister\u2019s wife, you know, speak to that disconnect with the reality that Canadian women face,\u201d\xa0Ashton told reporters in the Commons on Thursday.The ambiguity\u2019s part of the problem, says Joan\xa0Simalchik, program coordinator for the women and gender studies at University of Toronto.\u201cIt\u2019s a serious position and it\u2019s time for women to be recognized for the work they do,\u201d\xa0she said. \u201cIn that kind of murky situation it creates conditions for backlash.\u201dIt all started this week when Gr\xe9goire Trudeau was quoted\xa0in the Quebec City newspaper Le Soleil,\xa0saying she\u2019s overwhelmed by all the requests from groups that either invite her to speak or ask her to help promote their causes.\u201cI\u2019d like to be everywhere, but I can\u2019t,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cI have three children at home and a husband who is Prime Minister.

His family has a tax-payer funded cook and two nannies on staff for the couple\u2019s\xa0three children.But rather than complaining about the injustice of someone so comparatively privileged needing help, Simalchik argues this as an opportunity to better recognize women\u2019s invisible, unpaid labour \u2013 and give them more support.\u201cA good start would be a national childcare strategy. And long-term health for seniors \u2026 because women take the great degree of care-giving in family situations,\u201d she said.All the backlash Gr\xe9goire Trudeau has generated may ultimately be a good thing if it can spark a much-needed conversation, Simalchik said.\u201cUse it as an opportunity to get help for other women,\u201d Simalchik said, instead of penalizing one for admitting she\u2019s overwhelmed.If a second assistant is hired for\xa0Gr\xe9goire Trudeau, the PMO\xa0says the person would help ensure Gr\xe9goire Trudeau \u201cis supported at the official events she attends\u201d and make sure all the mail she receives is answered in a timely\xa0manner.Her assistant Natalie St-Denis already fields requests, and tries to accommodate as many as possible.Gr\xe9goire Trudeau has recently attended the CHEO Healthy Kids Awards, the Wabano Fundraising-Gala event, Anorexia and Bulimia awareness events, We Day events, Canadian Arts and Fashion Awards Gala, and a Women\u2019s Festival.She\u2019s\xa0the official spokesperson of the Fillactive foundation, which helps\xa012 to 17-year-old girls adopt healthy and active lifestyles.

New Zealand introduced a capital gains tax if a property is flipped within two years, while the U.K. doles out a capital gains tax of up to 28 per cent.It\u2019s too soon to fully assess the\xa0success of the new measures, the report cautions. However, in Australia foreign buyers of new homes have dropped from 16 per cent in Q3 of 2015 to the current rate of 12 per cent.While we wait for the numbers on foreign ownership in Canada, Ottawa could at the least start by applying a flipping fee, the report says.', u'Up next for millennials: \u2018Lifestyle managers\u2019 to do chores for themMillennials have a pretty bad reputation for\xa0wanting their lives to be easy.They\u2019re portrayed as a group of\xa0 and \xa0slackers.

Ontario, Nova Scotia and jurisdictions across the country are considering similar reforms. for loans with terms of less than two months (and, in the U.S., with interest rates of more than 36 per cent).In the meantime, credit unions and other organizations are stepping up to fill the real, multi-million-dollar need for short-term, small-sum loans for people whose credit isn\u2019t good enough to borrow money\xa0elsewhere.\xa0president Tony Irwin says that\u2019s a bad idea.

The transaction is expected to close at the end of the month following regulatory approvals.Canadian Tire, which also owns athletic retailer Sport Chek and clothier Mark\u2019s, has invested \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in innovation over the past few years, but Medline says the company still believes in bricks-and-mortar stores that are exciting for the customer.That includes everything from renovating existing stores to be more interactive to incorporating virtual reality for customers to test out how tires feel in different driving conditions.\u201cWe have seen what happens to many retailers in Canada who have taken for granted their market position and then fallen by the wayside. In an age of unprecedented disruption, innovation must be central to everything we do. Digital disruption is happening on a scale larger than any of us could\u2019ve imagined. No industry, including retail, will be immune to those changes.\u201dOn Thursday, Canadian Tire reported net income attributed to shareholders of $66.5 million, down 2.9 per cent from $68.5 million in the same year-earlier period.Revenue rose 1.8 per cent to $2.56 billion from $2.51 billion.Same-store sales, an important metric in retail, grew one per cent at Canadian Tire; 7.6 per cent at FGL Sports, which runs Sport Chek; and 0.8 per cent at Mark\u2019s.', u'13 weird things about Friday the 13thIt\u2019s Friday the 13th.

This is called\xa0paraskavedekatriaphobia, also known as friggatriskaidekaphobia.It\u2019s unclear how the idea that Friday the 13th was a day full of bad luck originated. But it appears to have taken hold on the public sometime in the early 1800s. However, there have been superstitions around the number 13 for hundreds of \xa0years. One such superstition is that if 13 people dine together, one will die within a year. That\u2019s believed to stem\xa0from a couple of sources: one, in the Christian religion, Jesus dined with 12 apostles before he was crucified. As well, a Norse legend tells of a dinner hosted by the god Odin with\xa011 of his close friends. The party was crashed by a 13th guest, Loki, the\xa0trickster god.For those who do suffer from\xa0friggatriskaidekaphobia, bad news: they can come in threes. In fact, 2015 was one of those years. \xa0But from 2017 until 2020, there will only be two a \xa0year.While we had three Friday the 13ths in 2015, this year we only get one. The last time we had just one Friday the 13th was in 2014.While we get a Friday the 13th almost every year, we can go one without one. But the longest we can go is 14 months, from either July through to September in a normal year or August through to October of the next\xa0leap year.We are such a superstitious lot that many apartments and buildings leave off \u201c13\u201d from their floors, going from 12 straight to 14. Which, of course, makes no sense since 13 comes after 12, no matter what you happen to call it.The king of old-time horror, Alfred Hitchcock, was born on Aug. 13, 1899. Hitchcock was most famous for his incredible direction and storytelling of horror and thriller films such as ,  and  among many others.The number 13 isn\u2019t bad luck to everyone. In some cultures it\u2019s looked upon as a good luck number. In Italy, for example, it was long considered good luck, as well as in the pagan culture.Everyone is afraid of something, right? Well, for famed French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte,\xa0apparently it was the number 13.In\xa01981, motorcycle enthusiast\xa0Chris Simons met with about 25 friends at the Commercial Hotel (now called Angelos of Dover) in Port Dover, Ont., on Friday the 13th. After enjoying themselves, they agreed to carry on the tradition of meeting every Friday the 13th. Since then, bikers from across the country and the United States meet in Port Dover for one of the largest rallies in North America, with estimates of some 100,000 attendees.Clearly whoever planned the Apollo 13 mission didn\u2019t suffer from\xa0triskaidekaphobia.Apollo 13 launched at 1:13 p.m. on April 11th with Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise. That\u2019s right: there are three 13s there (13:13 p.m. by military time). But all seemed to be going well in the two days following liftoff from Cape Canaveral.Then on April 13, during a routine stirring of the oxygen tanks on board the ship the Odyssey, there was an explosion which sent the capsule out of control, and ended the mission to the moon. After spending four days in the cold of space with no heat, the three astronauts landed safely back on Earth.Meet Apophis,\xa0an asteroid about 320 metres wide, which would cause some serious damage if it hit\xa0Earth. Well, it turns out that at one point, it was believed that there was a chance that this asteroid could impact Earth, though the chances were small. The date? April 13, 2029, a Friday. It will pass again on April 13, 2036. But it will be a Sunday.The good news is that further observations estimate that it will safely pass us by, no closer than just under 30,000 km away. If that sounds close, it is. So maybe on that Friday the 13th, we can all look up at Apophis and think how lucky we are.', u'Woman in her 70s gives birth to healthy baby boy following IVFA senior in India, who\u2019s believed to be between 70 and 72, has just become a first-time mom.She and her 79-year-old husband went through two years of in vitro fertilization using donor eggs, according to The couple\xa0wasn\u2019t able to afford the pricey treatment earlier in life.\u201cA person who is infertile [here] is not given a piece of land or any property by his father,\u201d fertility clinic owner Anurag Bishnoi explained to the newspaperadding that the man had to fight his father in the courts.He won, and then he got this piece of land and he got the money for the treatment.\u201dBishnoi added that Indian law doesn\u2019t allow adoption after 45 years of age. The pair\xa0apparently adopted a boy in the \u201980s, but he went on to study in the U.S. and reportedly never came back.When the two\xa0approached his\xa0fertility clinic, Bishnoi admitted \xa0he was initially reluctant to help them. He was concerned about the woman\u2019s age, plus \u201cshe looked frail.\u201dMedical tests apparently showed her to be fit and healthy, and he claims \u201cthe risk to her health of becoming pregnant was no higher than if she had been middle-aged.\u201dAfter three rounds of IVF, their\xa0baby\xa0boy was born \u201chealthy and hearty\u201d last month, weighing in at 4.4 pounds.Dr. Marjorie Dixon of the  in Toronto\xa0finds\xa0the situation concerning.Pregnancy is a huge stress on the body, she said. The older a woman is, the more chance there is of complications like hypertension, seizure, stroke and stillbirth.Of course, there\u2019s also the ethical and moral question.Bishnoi told his clients have\xa0relatives \u201cready to help take care of the baby.\u201dHe helped another 70-year-old become a first-time mother in 2009.The oldest patient Dixon\xa0helped impregnate with donor eggs was 49. Usually the IVF cut-off age in Canada is 45, she added.', u'Canadians have more adventurous sex as they get older, survey findsYour parents are probably having more exciting\xa0sex than you.For the first time in Canada, a new sexual health survey takes a peek at what\u2019s going on between the sheets of 40 to 59-year-olds.Sixty-three per cent of the 2,400 people surveyed say they\u2019re more sexually\xa0adventurous than they were a decade ago.Milhausen is\xa0a \xa0sexuality and relationship researcher at the University of Guelph who helped lead the\xa0Trojan-funded survey in partnership\xa0with the\xa0Sex Information and Education Council of Canada (SIECCAN).This demographic is particularly interesting to researchers\xa0because\xa0it\xa0was the first to grow up in the aftermath of the sexual revolution,\xa0explained\xa0SIECCAN executive director Alex McKay.\u201cThat was where we saw society take a more liberal turn to sexuality and people grew up with the idea that sexuality was something to be enjoyed,\u201d he said.Aside from their more sex-positive mindset, McKay thinks their\xa0increased focus\xa0on fitness and health compared to previous generations, has made a big difference in the bedroom.Some additional takeaways from the study:What you do after sex \u2014 and for how long \u2014\xa0may be the biggest predictor of how happy\xa0you are with it and your relationship, according to\xa0the experts.More than\xa070\xa0per cent of women who had post-coital\xa0cuddling following their most recent intercourse rated the experience \u201cvery pleasurable.\u201d By contrast, only \xa044 per cent of women who fewer than five minutes of love after sex were pleased.The research \xa0found six to 10 minutes of cuddling, kissing or pillow talk seems to be the sweet spot for sexual satisfaction.It\u2019s called the\xa0.\u201dSo stay awake and connect with your partner, Milhausen\xa0urges.People who tell their sexual partners what they like and dislike have better sex, the study found.But half of those surveyed aren\u2019t having that conversation.Emotional satisfaction appears to be\xa0another big factor in sexual enjoyment.The researchers believe that\u2019s because long-term couples know what works on their partner better than\xa0people in casual encounters.The latter have a greater likelihood of being more satisfied overall with their sex lives, though. Milhausen thinks this\xa0might be due to couples mistakenly equating quantity (which tends to decrease\xa0in longer-term unions) with quality.The older age group still seems better off sexually than university students, McKay said, referring to his 2013 study.\u201cHaving good sex isn\u2019t about having a young, hard body,\u201d he said. \u201cRather it\u2019s about being comfortable with yourself,\xa0knowing how to\xa0communicate with your partner and knowing what you want out of your sex life.Two-thirds of single men and almost three-quarters of single women in the survey admitted that they didn\u2019t use a condom the last time they had sex.More than half of those men, and a third of the women, had slept with two or more people in the last year.Half of that population admitted to using a condom during their last sexual encounter.He\xa0thinks young people\xa0may simply be more knowledgeable about STIs.\u201cWe have a lot of work to do to bring single midlife Canadians up to speed.\u201dYou can see more highlights from the survey below:', u'Triumph for UK woman who refused to wear high heels at workLONDON \u2013 A British receptionist who mustered public support after she was sent home from work for refusing to wear heels has been vindicated.Nicola Thorp, 27, had been told in December that her flat shoes were unacceptable in London while on assignment. She was sent home without pay after refusing to change her shoes.But Thorp fought back, writing up an online petition asking for it to be made illegal for employers to require female workers to wear heels at work.Simon Pratt, the managing director of the Portico employment agency, said Wednesday night the firm had changed its policy to allow workers to wear flat shoes if they prefer.Thorp\u2019s petition had attracted more than 54,000 signatures before the company\u2019s policy was changed.', u'Calvin Klein\u2019s upskirt ad causes outrage on social media latest ad campaign is receiving\xa0backlash online because it features\xa0a rather daring photo of Dutch actress, Klara Kristen.The \xa0looks up the skirt of the model\xa0who is 23 years old, but may look younger to some. The caption reads, \u201cI flash in #mycalvins\u201d along with the hashtag #takeapeek.London-based photographer Harley Weir, who is well-known for risqu\xe9 photos, shot the campaign.Social media critics say the picture is comparable to pornography; many add it could appeal to pedophiles since the model\xa0looks underage.Comments include,\xa0\u201cYour up the skirt picture is a shame. That is what pedophiles do\u2026 It is illegal to take a picture of someone under their skirt\u201d and \u201cCK making the world a (less) safe place for our daughters, sisters and wives.\u201dAnother person wrote, \u201cIs this what our world has come to? Taking my undergarment and fashion $$$ elsewhere. This, Calvin Klein, doesn\u2019t look like child pornography\u2013IT IS child pornography.\u201dAnother Calvin Klein ad starring Kristen received similar backlash in March 2016. Heidi Zak,\xa0CEO of the lingerie company ThirdLove, even started a  to have it taken down.The ad was posted on a large\xa0billboard in New York City beside another of rapper Fetty Wap. While her image said, \u201cI seduce in #mycalvins\u201d his said \u201cI make money in #mycalvins.\u201dThe billboard was taken down after the launch of the petition.\xa0In response to the controversy, Calvin Klein released a statement to which read,\u201cThis billboard was taken down overnight as part of the planned rotation of our spring 2016 advertising campaign.We take all of our consumers\u2019 concerns seriously, and as a global brand, we promote gender equality and the breakdown of gender stereotypes across the world. Our global advertising campaign images feature many different musicians, artists and models wearing all of our product categories, including our underwear products, sharing how they feel about and live in their Calvins.\u201d\u201dCalvin Klein\u2019s previous underwear campaigns have featured A-list celebrities\xa0like\xa0, \xa0and .', u'Google wants new emojis to represent professional womenMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2013 Google wants In a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, which controls specifications for emojis, Google says it wants to create a new set \u201cwith a goal of highlighting the diversity of women\u2019s careers and empowering girls everywhere.\u201d The proposal says women \u2013 and those under 30 in particular \u2013 are the most frequent users of emojis.Sample emojis provided by Google in the proposal show several female characters in professional clothing, including business suits, lab coats, medical scrubs and construction hats. One sample emoji even has a pitchfork and a farmer\u2019s hat. Google has also included sample male versions of the same emojis.Mountain View, California-based Google wants Unicode to standardize the emojis by the end of the year.', u'National child care proposal ready by summer, minister saysOTTAWA \u2013 The broad strokes of a national child care agreement, to be used as the basis for individual funding agreements between Ottawa and the provinces, will be available by summer, says the provincial minister in charge of the file.P.E.I. Education Minister Doug Currie says every province is keen to create quality, affordable child-care spaces accessible to families that want them.He says the bilateral agreements with each province would outline the areas of federal investment in early learning and child care based on principles adopted by each province.The money tied to each provincial deal would likely top up a base amount of per capita funding to each province, much like the way social program money is doled out.Currie says larger provinces with larger populations may need federal help to build new day care centres.Smaller provinces like his may be more interested in using the money to expand existing centres.The Liberals promised a national program in their campaign platform, but didn\u2019t tie it to any specific targets. Instead, the party agreed to work with provinces to come up with a system that would create affordable spaces accessible to all families.The federal government promised to give $400 million next year to provinces and territories for child care. That was conditional on the provinces and federal government agreeing on a national child-care framework that would establish ground rules for federal involvement in what is an area of provincial jurisdiction.\u201cWe want to find ways to invest these limited resources in the most efficient manner and the most inclusive manner and that\u2019s why we have to talk very closely and very seriously with provinces and territories.\u201dNegotiations on the framework started in February, when Duclos met his provincial and territorial counterparts.Child-care advocates are closely watching the outcome of the talks, hoping to land a long-discussed national program that seemed a certainty in 2005, when the Paul Martin government came to agreements with provinces.The federal Liberals have said they want to create a program that takes into account the work provinces have done in the last 10 years.New research suggests most provinces were selective in the evidence they used in creating policies around early childhood education, specifically all-day kindergarten. A paper in the journal Canadian Public Administration says provinces outside Quebec looked at day care and kindergarten isolated from a broader family-based policy that experts say is needed for an integrated early childhood care and education system.Any federal child-care framework would have to invest in buildings, wage enhancements for early childhood educators, operating grants to day care centres and subsidies to either put fees on a sliding scale based on income, or eliminate them altogether, said Linda White, interim director of the school of public policy and governance at the University of Toronto.', u"\u2018We are loan sharks\u2019: Why one woman\u2019s leaving the payday loan businessYou don\u2019t ask people how much they want to borrow: You tell them how much you\u2019re lending them.That\u2019s one of the first things Kathy Durocher learned as a\xa0payday lending employee, she says.During a training session, \u201cI had said, \u2018Are you going to take another loan?\u2019 And the person said yes. And they told me how much. And my manager,\xa0in training, stopped me right after and said, \u2018No. You never ask. You tell them. You say, \u2018I\u2019m giving you this amount today.'\u201dDurocher claims she\u2019d be penalized for not loaning someone the maximum amount that person was eligible for. says most loan approval procedures are automated, and cites a study of transactions from three payday lending companies that found 62 per cent of borrowers in 2014 didn\u2019t borrow the maximum amount, and the average customer borrowed 68.1 per cent of the maximum.\u201cThis indicates that borrowers are aware of their financial circumstances and seek to borrow the specific amount they need,\u201d the  wrote in an email.After\xa0five years\xa0at two payday loan companies, working at locations across Calgary, Durocher is\xa0calling it quits.\u201cI can\u2019t go to work stressing that [if] I\u2019m not getting somebody in a deeper hole, that I\u2019ll get fired.\u201dIrwin, says his members\xa0provide an essential service, giving loans to people who need money and have no other way to get it.Alberta is  in the province before existing regulations expire next month. Ontario, Nova Scotia and other jurisdictions are pondering the same.Irwin says he and his members have been in touch with suggestions of their own.But he takes issue with the name Alberta\u2019s\xa0already given its bill: An Act to End Predatory Lending.\u201cThat name certainly would seem to be at odds with what this industry is.\u201dCanadian communities\xa0are hardly alone in wanting to rein in the payday loan industry.Google announced\xa0Wednesday that,\xa0. (In the U.S. only, it\u2019s also banning ads whose interest rate is 36 per cent or higher.)\u201cResearch has shown that these loans can result in unaffordable payment and high default rates for users,\u201d reads .\u201cThis change is designed to protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products.\u201d\u201cGovernments, consumer advocates and credit counsellors all say payday loans are a needed service,\u201d Irwin wrote in an email.Durocher\xa0sought out a job at a payday lender because of how much she\u2019d been helped by one before. When her dog George was hurt and she needed money for an emergency veterinary bill, a payday loan came through.She\u2019s since changed her mind.Durocher says one manager told her\xa0not to tell people out loud how much they would end up owing on the money they were taking out, but only to highlight the amount in paperwork.\u201cI was told not to tell them what the payback is \u2026 You\u2019re supposed to circle the amount they owe and the date and point [it out] to them as you\u2019re putting it through the window and say, \u2018This is what you owe and it\u2019s due December\xa022. for example.'\u201dDisclosure provisions are set out in regulations, Irwin said in an email, \u201cincluding a poster in the lobby that shows the cost of a typical $300 loan.People have a 24-hour window if they want to change their minds, Durocher said.Durocher hated having to call people when they were late repaying their loans.\u201cWe\u2019re told not to let them off the phone.\xa0We\u2019re told to say, \u2018I understand, but I need a date for you to pay,'\u201d she said.Durocher said she gets evaluated on whether customers come through on the payment\xa0promises they\xa0make over the phone.Collection practices are subject to regulations, Irwin said in an emailed statement.\u201cHaving said that these are small loans and lenders will want to have the borrower contact them before the due date if there is a problem so the loan can be extended rather than having a payment returned [\u2018not sufficient funds\u2019].It\u2019s gotten worse in Calgary since Christmas, Durocher says, as\xa0families squeezed by oil\u2019s free-fall turned to a longtime lender of last resort, only to find themselves unable to pay their debts.She says she\u2019s been cursed, spat at, threatened.Contrary to popular belief, Irwin says, payday lenders haven\u2019t cashed in on Canada\u2019s oilsands slump.\u201cPeople are in need more than ever. [But] if they\u2019re unemployed, they don\u2019t get a payday loan.\u201dMany payday lenders do make loans to people on social assistance, however. Irwin said each company makes that determination for themselves.Jurisdictions across North America are experimenting with payday lender regulations.One possibility pioneered in San Francisco is to limit the proliferation of payday loan locations through zoning regulations.Irwin would rather not see that happen.\u201cI\xa0don\u2019t think that\u2019s something where there should be limits imposed. And that\u2019s something\xa0customer demand will dictate.\u201dGlobal News maps based on tax statistics\xa0and business location information from  \xa0payday loan locations are disproportionately located in areas with lower-income residents or with a higher percentage of residents receiving social assistance. Irwin says there\u2019s no correlation: They\u2019re going where customers are, just like any other retailer.\u201cWe\u2019ve mapped where our members are located,\xa0and\xa0we find they\u2019re in all kinds of different areas, different incomes,\u201d he said.\u201cThe criteria that seems to be important is areas that have a lot\xa0of foot traffic; areas people can access, transportation corridors, downtown areas \u2014 where a lot of other retail businesses\xa0locate.\u201dIrwin likes Alberta\u2019s regulations as they stand.\xa0But his organization has made suggestions for whatever comes next.One recommendation they\u2019ve made to the Alberta, Ontario and Nova Scotia governments is for payday lenders to\xa0start offering a \u201cvoluntary extended payment plan\u201d that gives the borrower more time to pay back the loan and fee without accruing additional interest over that grace period.A \xa0found that the minimum their industry could charge per $100 payday loan is $20.74. Anything under that, Irwin said, and the business model\xa0doesn\u2019t work.\u201cA small-sum, short-term loan is expensive to provide.\u201dIf payday lenders were \u201cregulated out of existence,\u201d Irwin says, it would hurt people who don\u2019t have alternatives.\u201cWhere would our customers go if we weren\u2019t here, or if regulations were such that industry was reduced significantly?\u201dThat could make people turn to illegal lenders online, Irwin said.\u201cThey\u2019re going online and they\u2019re getting a payday loan from a company that\u2019s not licensed, not regulated, not complying with regulations \u2026 The consumer is definitely worse off.\u201d", u"JOEY restaurant server forced to wear heels despite \u2018bleeding\u2019 feetAn Edmonton woman\xa0has given her JOEY restaurant serving job the boot over a bloody high heel argument.\u201cMy friend\u2019s feet were bleeding to the point she lost a toe nail and she was still discouraged and berated by the shift manager for changing into flats,\u201d Nicola Gavins wrote on  on behalf of her unidentified friend, who resigned from\xa0the downtown location following the incident.We reached out to Gavins but hadn\u2019t heard back by the time of publishing.She\xa0also accused the chain of making its female staff purchase a $30 dress uniformHer\xa0criticism of the restaurant chain\u2019s \u201csexist, archaic requirements\u201d was\xa0shared more than 10,000 times over the past week.Of the\xa0hundreds who commented on the post, a couple questioned the validity of the accusations, saying the socks\xa0looked more wine-stained than blood-soaked.The vast majority, though, expressed\xa0outrage over the situation. And a few were less than surprised\xa0by it.A\xa0former JOEY hostess recalled being told in 2007 that she\u2019d only\xa0get promoted to a\xa0server if she \u201clost weight and got hotter.\u201d\u201c\u2018Oh ya after like six months of running around in heels, you\u2019ll really slim down,'\u201d she claimed to have been\xa0told. \u201cKeep in mind the most I ever weighed was 125 pounds.\u201dAs for getting \u201chotter,\u201d that apparently\xa0involved her hair being longer.\u201cIt was a disgusting and degrading place to work,\u201d she wrote. She told Global News she experienced the same policies at two locations.Other past and present employees stood up for the chain, though, which was recently named one of the top 20 best places to work in Canada and \u201c.\u201dAmanda Dickson, who\xa0served\xa0there for three years, denied ever being forced to wear heels. \u201cWe were required to wear black shoes. That\u2019s it,\u201d she wrote on the thread, adding this may have been an issue with a local manager.Gavins replied with a photo that appeared to be from a JOEY training manual. It said women\u2019s shoes \u201cmust have a minimum of a one-inch heel.\u201dSimilar situations have played out\xa0at a number of restaurants, including Moxie\u2019s in Calgary.Despite Moxie\u2019s management denying any high heel requirement, its\xa0server guidelines Global News obtained last summer stipulated a minimum 1.5-inch sleek heel was required.In Toronto, the Shark Club used a\xa0\u201chow to feel comfortable in high heels\u201d explainer, advising female servers to wear a certain kind of three-inch heel.Women from the\xa0\xa0chains came forward with similar complaints of being forced to wear heels following our reports on Moxie\u2019s.A Calgary Original Joe\u2019s server even claimed her \xa0at work. She said she was in so much pain after her shift that she couldn\u2019t stand.Health experts have repeatedly cautioned women about the negative impacts of wearing high heels.\u201cChronic high heel use can affect the ankles, the knees, the low-back, the hips,\u201d chiropractor Stacia Kelly told us last year.In an emailed statement to Global News, JOEY\u2019s VP of marketing, Britt Innes, explained there had been a change in footwear policy in March in response to\xa0all the recent attention on dress code in the service industry.\u201cWe conducted audits and sent out a survey to get our partners\u2019 anonymous insights and feedback. The major learning from our partners was that they wanted a change in our shoe guidelines,\u201d she said.\u201cWe made these changes and rolled this out in late March. However, it is clear that it did not reach every partner and I take ownership for that. In retrospect, we should have ensured all outdated training materials were destroyed.\u201dShe sent the image below of the chain\u2019s current shoe guidelines.The company is also considering a change to its dress code, according to Innes. It\u2019s currently a\xa0black dress for women but may eventually become a T-shirt and jeans for both males and females. That uniform is being tested at select locations.Innes added that she\xa0reached out to the employee as soon as she\xa0saw the Facebook post. A company-wide memo was sent out to as well, to ensure everyone\u2019s on the same page around the new policies and guidelines.", u'Italy gives legal rights to gay couplesROME \u2013 Italy joined the rest of Europe on Wednesday in giving some legal rights to gay couples after a years-long battle and opposition from the Catholic Church to anything that smacked of authorizing gay marriage.The lower Chamber of Deputies voted 372-51 with 99 abstentions to approve legislation already passed in February by the Senate. Earlier, the chamber approved a confidence motion tied to the law.Gay rights activists hailed the vote as historic, given that Italy was the last of the European Union\u2019s 28 nations to grant legal recognition to civil unions. But they voiced disappointment that the government had sacrificed a provision to allow gay adoption to ensure passage.The legislation grants same-sex couples many of the same rights as married couples: the possibility of having the same last name, inheritance rights, hospital visitation rights and medical decision-making rights. But it stops far short of authorizing gay marriage.The Vatican, which holds sway politically and socially in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy, maintains that marriage is a lifelong bond between man and woman. \t\t\t\n\t\tPremier Matteo Renzi praised the vote as \u201cwriting another important page for the Italy that we love.\u201dItaly\u2019s leading Catholic bishop, Monsignor Nunzio Galantino, had criticized the government\u2019s decision to put the bill to a confidence vote to ensure passage, saying it was a \u201closs for everyone.\u201dRenzi replied that he did so to avoid \u201cany more delays after years of failed attempts.\u201d', u'Getting mail to Fort McMurray wildfire evacuees: Canada Post\u2019s emergency measuresDisplaced Fort McMurray residents can pick up their Canada Child Tax Benefit and Universal Child Care Benefit cheques in Edmonton on Friday, Saturday and Tuesday.To do so, cheque recipients must provide a government-issued ID.Evacuees going to pick up these cheques are asked to go to the main entrance of the Telus World of Science Edmonton from 12 p.m. To 8 p.m. on Friday, May 20 and Saturday May 21 and from 12 p.m. until 5 p.m. on Tuesday, May 24.

Durex wants a condom emoji to promote safe sexThis might sound obvious, but  believes condoms are the key to promoting safe sex \u2013 emoji condoms, that is.In an \u201copen text message\u201d to the Unicode Consortium \u2013  \u2013 the condom company said it believes giving smartphone users the option to send emoji condoms could help encourage conversations about safe sex.\u201cIt\u2019s clear to see we need one \u2013 it\u2019s not rocket science. Emojis have changed how we talk about the birds and the bees,\u201d reads a plain-English translation of the company\u2019s message. The original version was written mostly in emojis.Durex claims the condom \u2013 arguably the biggest symbol for promoting safe sex \u2013 will encourage smartphone users to talk about safe sex with their partners, adding that the discussion of safe sex is vital to preventing sexually transmitted diseases and infections, including HIV and AIDS.There is no doubt that emojis have become a new part of communication since their rise to popularity in 2011. when it picked an emoji \u2013 the \u201cFace with Tears of Joy\u201d emoji to be exact \u2013 as its 2015 \u201cword\u201d of the year, prompting linguistic experts from all over the world to weigh in on whether emojis had become their\xa0own language.\u201cDigital communication is the sign of our times. And emoji functions extremely well in that medium, often in language-like ways. And for this reason, it is surely not a stretch to consider an emoji to be, if not a word in the conventional sense, at the very least, having language-like properties,\u201d wrote Vyvyan Evans, professor of linguistics at Bangor University in a blog post for Oxford Dictionaries.Social media strategist Brent Stirling with Ryerson University\u2019s business incubator DMZ added, \u201cAs more and more communication and interaction between people turns digital, emojis fill the gap that text cannot. This allows people to communicate their tone, body language and facial expressions that would normally accompany an in-person conversation.\u201dOr perhaps, as Durex hopes, allow people to bring up uncomfortable topics like contraception.And while a condom emoji may inspire a bit of giggling from some users, let\u2019s not forget that campaigns like this have worked in the past.The taco emoji was a product of an online petition started by Taco Bell that garnered over 32,000 signatures by the time the new symbol was released.Emojis featuring a variety of skin tones on Apple\u2019s iOS platform were also created in response to However, whether the condom emoji could actually help promote safe sex and cut down on the transmission of STDs is unclear.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Red Cross gives $50M, Alberta gives $100M in emergency fundingThe Red Cross will provide $50 million in emergency funds and the Alberta government will provide $100 million in\xa0emergency funding for thousands of Fort McMurray fire evacuees.On Wednesday, the\xa0Red Cross said each adult would receive $600 and each child would receive $300. The province previously announced it would provide $1,250 per adult and $500 per dependent.People who have given the Red Cross an email address will receive the funds through e-transfer in the next 24 to 48 hours. The Red Cross said if you didn\u2019t provide an email, they will reach out to you.\u201cNo matter where they are in Canada, we will reach out,\u201d Conrad Sauve, president and CEO of the Canadian Red Cross said.\xa0\u201cWe will take care of you wherever you are.\u201dHe\xa0called the emergency funding effort the most important and fastest direct cash transfer in the organization\u2019s history.So far, $67 million has been donated to the Red Cross for Fort McMurray wildfire relief.\u201cOver the past week, the people of Alberta have demonstrated incredible compassion, care and humanity,\u201d Sauve said. \xa0The federal government has pledged to match donations to the cause and the province will match donations from Albertans. \xa0The details on how\xa0that matching program will be sorted have not been worked out yet.\u201cOur officials are in conversations with Red Cross about matching funds,\u201d Notley said. \u201cMeanwhile the Red Cross has very generously offered to work with us on their electronic systems to help get our funds to those outside of Alberta.\u201dPremier Rachel Notley said pre-loaded debit cards will begin to be distributed Wednesday at designated  until May 20.The debit card locations will be open from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday and then from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. after that. More locations will be added in the coming days, the province said.After May 20, emergency financial assistance will move to Alberta Works offices.One family member can pick up debit cards for the entire family if they have documentation: a Red Cross registration number, photo ID, identification for a partner/spouse or dependents (if claiming for them), proof of residence in the community.Notley\xa0said there will be long lines and asked those who don\u2019t need the money immediately to hold off on getting their debit cards. If you don\u2019t have identification, statutory declarations will be accepted.\u201cOur aim is to get help to the evacuees who need it the most as quickly as possible,\u201d Notley said.\u201cIn order to allow for immediate distribution to people who are in most urgent need, we are asking evacuees who aren\u2019t in dire need of these funds to wait a few days before claiming them.Seniors, individuals with mobility issues, those with special needs and others who are in Alberta but unable to apply in person at a debit card location can contact 310-4455 to make alternative arrangements.\u201cLet me conclude by saying this emergency funding underscores the commitment every Albertan owes to each other,\u201d Notley said. \u201cIt is about Albertans helping Albertans. The fire has affected thousands\xa0of lives \u2013 Albertans who have contributed to this province.\u201dSauve said there has been an outpouring of support for this cause.\u201cThis is unprecedented in regards to individual giving,\u201d he said, referring to donations.\u201cWe know already the damage will be in the billions and it will take years to recover,\u201d Sauve added. \u201cBut we also know the needs are immediate.\u201dThe millions donated to the cause through the Canadian Red Cross by\xa0individuals and corporations has eclipsed public support for past national disasters such as the 2013 southern Alberta floods, Lac Megantic rail disaster and 2011 Slave Lake wildfire.As of Wednesday, the Red Cross had registered more than 80,000 people.\xa0All evacuees must register no matter where they are staying. You can or by calling 1-888-350-6070.Ontario will contribute $500,000 to the Red Cross to help wildfire relief and recovery efforts in Alberta. The province has also sent over 60 firefighters, three strike team leaders and 16 other staff to help on the ground.The federal Liberals have struck a cabinet committee involving nine different ministries to handle the aftermath of the Fort McMurray wildfire.Kent Hehr, the Calgary MP who serves as Veterans Affairs minister and associate minister of defence, will chair the committee, which includes ministers responsible for public safety, health, natural resources, infrastructure, labour and employment insurance, among others.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is to visit Fort McMurray on Friday and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley says she\u2019s already planning to urge the federal government to extend enhanced employment insurance benefits to Edmonton as a result of the wildfire fall-out.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will come as a huge surprise to the prime minister that we are well past the justification for new EI rules in the Edmonton area,\u201d Notley said. \u201cThe EI numbers came out and, under the current circumstances, there is a good case for it to be extended.\u201dEdmonton-area MP Rona Ambrose, the interim Conservative leader, offered rare praise for the government\u2019s cabinet committee move, calling it a very smart way to speed up decision-making.As of 6 p.m. MT Wednesday, the two fires in the Fort McMurray area that had joined together remained roughly 229,000 hectares in size. The wildfire is about 25 kilometres from the Saskatchewan boundary.There are 700 firefighters, 32\xa0helicopters, 13 air tankers and 83\xa0pieces of heavy equipment battling the wildfire. A steady stream of water bombers continued to fly over the roadblock south of Fort McMurray Tuesday. There was no heavy smoke, but crews were hitting hotspots.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a scene of devastation,\u201d Jeremy Hall said. He\u2019s a volunteer from Grande Prairie who\u2019s working with firefighters\xa0on the front lines.\u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart, that\u2019s for sure. A lot of people are going to be really upset to see it when they get back, there\u2019s no question. You can see just along the road here, it\u2019s a scene out of\xa0a movie. There\u2019s cars in the ditch and they\u2019re burnt and stuff. It\u2019s really tragic, but then you come around the next corner and there\u2019s a glimmer of hope because this whole entire subdivision might be in fantastic shape, not even touched.\u201cYou know this city is strong. They\u2019re going to rebuild,\u201d Hall said.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s Alberta Strong. Everyone has been going with that and I think it needs to stick with that.\u201dHe described having to pull down the walls of\xa0one\xa0home to stop the fire from spreading to many more.\u201cI could see a picture on the wall,\u201d Hall\xa0recalled, his voice breaking. \u201cThe little girl\u2019s name was Rebecca and the pictures on the wall\u2026 It was tough. It was really tough.\u201dShortly before 5 p.m. Wednesday, RCMP provided an update on their work in Fort McMurray.Inspector Kevin Kunetzki said the Fort McMurray RCMP detachment was open and operational and the Timberlea detachment would also be open soon. He said there are about 300 RCMP members in the community conducting patrols, checkpoints and other security.Kunetzki said RCMP saw\xa0100 instances of forced entry into homes \u2013 91 of the cases were found by initial police canvassing after the fire and nine were more recent. However, police cautioned against\xa0assuming criminal activity.\u201cSome of these cases of forced entry might be the result of neighbours looking to care for their neighbours and make sure they got out safely, if pets may have been in the residence.\u201dKunetzki said RCMP had responded to five reports of missing people and said in all cases, people have been found safe and sound.Mounties have also taken several guns into their possession since the community was evacuated.Kunetzki said two guns were seized as part of a break-and-enter investigation, one gun was found in a park and later connected to a May 7 break-and-enter investigation, and some firearms were turned over to RCMP to ensure they were safely kept.\u201cPolice are not forcefully entering homes to seize firearms,\u201d he stressed, adding there were three cases where guns were involved.Travel into Fort McMurray was still restricted to essential services only. There is still no public access into the city.\xa0As of Tuesday, industrial and commercial vehicles carrying supplies and equipment for oilsands operations were being allowed through Fort McMurray to worksites north of the city.RCMP have begun removing vehicles abandoned on the highway, including vehicles left at northern work camps when evacuees were flown out.Individuals forced to abandon their vehicles on Highway 63 during the evacuation should call Highway 63 Towing & Recovery at 1-877-671-2717 to confirm if your vehicle is at the yard.In order to pick up your vehicle, you must have your driver\u2019s licence and car key, registration and insurance (which may be in the glove box).Highway 63 Towing & Recovery is located in Wandering River, approximately 230 km north of Edmonton.\xa0Costs for towing and storage of abandoned vehicles will be covered by the province.The Beaver Lake Provincial Recreation Area campground near Lac La Biche is Alberta Parks\u2019 primary location for evacuees who are equipped to camp. No charge.\xa0Alberta Parks will also accept evacuees equipped to camp in other provincial campgrounds, also free of charge.In a meeting in Calgary Wednesday, ATCO Ltd. said it has a crew of 300 people in Fort McMurray working around the clock. They haven\u2019t turned the gas back on yet and won\u2019t until it is safe.COO Siegfried Kiefer said 75 per cent of the power is ready to go but bringing it back online will be staged.The company is also working with oilsands companies about recharging their sites. Kiefer expects the process to take weeks, but not as long as a month.ATCO also has 4,000 beds available and can provide longer-term space for evacuees if needed.The company will also be donating 10,000 meals to emergency responders.About 12,000 of the Fort McMurray evacuees are students, some of whom are graduating Grade 12 this year. On Wednesday, Education Minister David Eggen told\xa0Global News Morning Edmonton that\xa0no student will be penalized for missing days or weeks of school.If students choose not to return for the last month and a half of the school year, they will receive the mark they had to date as their final grade.\xa0The 900 Grade 12 students facing diploma exams have the option of writing them, or finishing the year with the grade they have right now.Although the options are in place, the province and school officials are encouraging students to enrol in their nearest school to restore a sense of routine and normalcy during a chaotic time. About 1,900 students have already done so.', u'Age and income top factors in staying with single employer: pollCHICAGO \u2013 A new poll says more than 40 per cent of America\u2019s baby boomers stayed with their employer for more than 20 years. But it\u2019s unlikely that their children or grandchildren will experience the same job tenure.The survey of more than 1,000 Americans 50 and older by the Associated Press- shows that 41 per cent of those employed workers have spent two decades with the same company, including 18 per cent who\u2019ve stayed at least 30 years.But it\u2019s a trend more common among the older baby boomers than younger ones, and traditional pensions appear to be one of the driving factors.Among those who have had at least 20 years with a single employer, the survey found that about half are excited about retirement, but a third are anxious about their post-work lives.David McQuinn, 61, is retiring Tuesday after 30 years with MiTek, a construction and engineering firm in suburban St. Louis. He says there were times he thought about leaving but he liked his co-workers and his senior position and also owned stock in the company.\u201cI started working young and I\u2019ve been a man in a hurry my whole life,\u201d he says, \u201cand now I\u2019m in a hurry to not be in a hurry.\u201dHis experience exemplifies a trait among boomers: more attachment to the company than the younger generations. But even among older Americans there\u2019s a gap in employment tenure: Half of those aged 65 and up but only a third of those age 50 to 64 have stayed with the same employer for at least two decades.The shift may be less about differences in attitude than changes in jobs \u2014 and benefits.About two-thirds of those who stayed with one employer for 20 or more years had a pension, according to the survey, compared with only a third of those who had never stayed that long with one employer.Those defined benefit pension plans are slowly disappearing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that only 18 per cent of private workers were covered by these plans in 2011, down from 35 per cent in the early 1990s. More common now are plans like 401(k)s, which are more portable from one employer to another.The agency has reported that a larger proportion of older workers than younger workers had more tenure on the job. For example it said, in January 2014, the average tenure with the current employer was 7.9 years for people 45 to 54, compared to 10.4 years for those 55 to 64.\u201cThink of all the choices people have today. I mean, who ever heard of a social-media analyst five years ago?\u201d says Joe Coughlin, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s AgeLab.Coughlin says higher churn in the labour market also means companies will have to work harder to hire and retain the workers they need, and this creates leverage.Christina Guerrero worked in the mid-1980s as a housekeeper at Austin\u2019s Brackenridge Hospital before applying for and getting a job as a clinical assistant.She kept that job for 17 years, before moving to a neighbouring children\u2019s hospital. Lifting children into hospital beds, she recalls, was easier on her back then moving adults.\u201cI thought about looking for other jobs, but almost any hospital these days would require me to go back to school to finish my GED, so that was a big reason for staying put,\u201d says Guerrero, now 61.According to the AP-NORC survey, younger baby boomers were much more likely to have gone back to school in the past five years: 30 per cent of those age 50-64, compared to 19 per cent of those 65 and older.Most went for additional training because their employer required it or they wanted to learn something new or fun. Only 17 per cent said they received training to start a new career.Joe Abraham, 65, says he\u2019s sure he \u201cdodged a few bullets along the way\u201d during his 36-year career as an attorney at Ford Motor Co.Now retired, he says the raises and benefits he got from Ford were not worth giving up for something else. Plus, he just liked his colleagues._________\xa0', u'Body shaming backlash: Magazine for girls apologizes for swimsuit articleNEW YORK \u2013 The publisher of a magazine aimed at tween girls apologized Tuesday for offering adult-like tips on choosing bathing suits based on size and curves, unleashing a body shaming backlash.Girls who are \u201ccurvy\u201d on top, for instance, were advised in the latest issue of Discovery Girls to go for a one-piece with other side cutouts or ties to draw attention to elsewhere. Big block patterns were offered for those rounder in the middle \u2014 all under the headline: \u201cWhat Swimsuit Best Suits You?\u201dThe magazine is aimed at 8- to 12-year-olds.After taking heat on Twitter and other social media, founder and publisher Catherine Lee issued a lengthy apology on the . She, too, expressed shock that such an approach was published. She called herself the mother of the first Discovery Girl, in 2000.\u201cI am in total agreement with all of you regarding this article, so much so that I wanted to make this letter as public as possible,\u201d she wrote.\u201cWe want to make sure that our girls know that any article that makes you feel bad about your body is not a good article, and should be questioned.\u201dThe article was supposed to be \u201cabout finding cute, fun swimsuits that make girls feel confident, but instead it focused on girls\u2019 body image and had a negative impact,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNobody knows better than Discovery Girls how impressionable our girls are at this age and we are ALWAYS mindful of this.\u201dThe magazine has received hundreds of thousands of letters over the years from \u201cgirls sharing their insecurities about their bodies,\u201d Lee added.She said the magazine is \u201cnot immune to making mistakes, but we are always willing to get better and learn from our mistakes.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Red Cross has raised $60 million and countingCALGARY \u2013 The large amount of money donated to the Red Cross to help Fort McMurray wildfire evacuees is eclipsing public support for past Canadian disasters.The Canadian Red Cross has already collected $60 million from individuals and corporations. That number doesn\u2019t include additional money coming from Ottawa and the Alberta government, which have both promised to match donations made by individuals.\u201cI don\u2019t have a breakdown on what the individual number is yet, but we\u2019ve had very good corporate support,\u201d Red Cross spokeswoman Shelly Makrugin said Tuesday.She said every disaster is different, \u201cso we don\u2019t compare disasters per se.\u201dBut at $60 million and counting, donations have already surpassed the $43.3 million Canadians gave during the catastrophic 2013 southern Alberta floods. More than 100,000 people in several communities, including Calgary and High River, were forced from their homes.Red Cross donations after the 2013 Lac Megantic rail disaster that killed 47 people and destroyed half the community\u2019s downtown totalled $14.8 million.The 2011 wildfire that destroyed one-third of Slave Lake, Alta., five years ago brought in $5.5 million.Makrugin said the Red Cross is in \u201cemergency mode\u201d in the Fort McMurray area. Cash is being used to make sure those affected get basics such as cots, blankets and hygiene kits.The agency provides help on top of what insurance companies and government programs offer.\u201cThe phase right now is emergency response, which is covering people\u2019s basic needs, and it will also be used for the recovery and the rebuilding phases as well,\u201d she said.The Red Cross was involved for four years after the Slave Lake fire, which destroyed 400 buildings.', u'Vegan comfort food trend bigger than everTORONTO \u2013 Just because you follow a vegan diet doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want to indulge in a burger.\u201cPeople don\u2019t just go vegan to be healthy. For a lot of people it\u2019s an animal issue, but they still want burgers and bacon and everything else so they\u2019re looking for those really satisfying substitutes for that,\u201d says Candice Hutchings, who shows viewers how to repurpose traditional food offerings on her .Her most popular recipes include a vegan take on the McDonald\u2019s Big Mac and  \u2014 with the meat being a dough made of vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast and spices.Hutchings started making vegan recipe and lifestyle videos several years ago and then quit her advertising job last October to devote herself full time to the project.\u201cWhen I went vegan six years ago my biggest issue and what was making me fall off the wagon constantly was there wasn\u2019t food I wanted to eat. Everything was brown and oatmealy. The comfort food was really missing and I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere at the time,\u201d says Hutchings, who first abstained from dairy products to clear up skin problems.\u201cThere weren\u2019t any restaurants that served it. There weren\u2019t really any online recipes that I could find. I started kind of experimenting because there was such a void in that market.\u201dVegans and vegetarians don\u2019t eat meat. But while vegetarians will eat dairy products and eggs, vegans generally won\u2019t and also avoid honey or any food derived from animals.\u201cOnce you get into a lifestyle you tend to learn a bit more about animal agriculture and kind of what\u2019s going on in the industry and all the horrible things that are happening and after seeing that I couldn\u2019t look back. You can never unsee,\u201d Hutchings says.Restaurants specializing in plant-based foods have been springing up the last few years, but one that\u2019s attracted a lot of social media attention in the last few weeks is , a partnership between the owners of the popular Hollywood restaurant and Ecorazzi, an online vegan magazine that hosted last year\u2019s Toronto Vegan Food and Drink Festival.\u201cDoomie\u2019s is trying to break a number of vegan stereotypes that exist out there today, one of which is all vegans are just super health conscious and only eat grain and rice bowls and kind of steer away from eating anything unhealthy. And I guess we\u2019re just trying to showcase the fact that vegans are just like anyone else,\u201d says Cara Galloway, communications and event manager for Doomie\u2019s Toronto.The Queen Street West restaurant has seen people lining up to try vegan burgers and pulled pork sandwiches and fries prepared a dozen different ways, including toppings of vegan cheese, bacon and chili, pesto, Sriracha, mushrooms, jalapenos or garlic.Patrons must ask their server for the \u201csecret\u201d $16 Vegan Mac Daddy. The mock Big Mac comes with fries and features house-made toppings of vegan mayo for the special sauce and a soy-based \u201ccheese.\u201dHutchings waited for two hours last week to get a table at Doomie\u2019s and said it was worth it. She found the food resembles what she makes on Edgy Veg.\u201cThere\u2019s Hogtown Vegan in Toronto, but they\u2019re more on the comfort food side whereas I found this was like junk food. It gets that junk food craving out of your system.\u201dMuch of the food at Doomie\u2019s is based on soy- and wheat-based products.Hutchings thinks one reason people fail when creating vegan lookalikes is they try to adapt other vegan recipes.\u201cI look up the original recipe so if I\u2019m trying to make, let\u2019s say a Philly cheesesteak sandwich or chicken wings, I look to see what spices they\u2019re actually using in the wings and what they\u2019re using in the batter and then I use vegan substitutes.\u201dFor meat, she may use mushrooms, which have a meaty taste and texture. Or she prepares seitan \u2014 also called wheat meat \u2014 from vital wheat gluten. She uses soy or almond milk instead of cows milk.A favourite indulgence is cauliflower \u201cwings,\u201d which she coats with a spiced breaded mixture, then double deep-fries and tosses in hot sauce.\u201cI think that is the closest thing to wings I\u2019ve had yet. It\u2019s the same kind of texture. The cauliflower doesn\u2019t have a real cauliflower flavour. It has that meaty pulled pork flavour\u2026. It was satisfying and anyone I\u2019ve served it to, it blows their mind.\u201d', u'Couple finds humour in infertility with pregnancy announcement parodiesSpencer and Whitney Blake have\xa0found a funny way to tackle a subject that one in six Canadian couples may find particularly painful: infertility.After struggling with the issue themselves for years, the Idaho couple\xa0recently made\xa0fake \u201cinfertility announcements\u201d to help others cope.They\u2019re a spoof of some of the most creative/common ways parents-to-be\xa0share that they\u2019re expecting.\xa0Like this Instagram post:\u201cWe started thinking it would be funny to create our own infertile equivalents.\xa0For us personally, for this particular problem, we found that having a sense of humour made infertility a bit more bearable.\u201dThe six creations they\u2019ve posted on their  seem to have resonated with other infertile couples, many of whom have reportedly contacted the Blakes to thank them.On the blog, Whitney writes of how consuming infertility once was for the pair.\u201cBetween monitoring my temperature first thing when I woke up in the morning to sometimes daily doctors appointments\u2026 between the charts, kits, pills, drugs and tests\u2026 between other people\u2019s baby showers and pregnancy announcements\u2026 between the frenzied hope and desire at the beginning of the month to the acute heartache and despair at the end of it, it\u2019s kinda hard to forget even when you\u2019re trying not to dwell on it.\u201dSince their \u201cunexplained infertility\u201d diagnosis, the 30-year-old\xa0and her husband have adopted two \u201cmischievous, curly-haired, curious, sweet, little fire-engine-loving\u201d boys, aged four and two.\u201cInfertility is part of what created our family and it is definitely one of the significant things that makes me\u2026 me,\u201d she added.For those who are still on the emotional roller coaster, the Blakes offer these words of encouragement:\u201cThough the road can seem lonely, you are not alone.\u201d', u'Budweiser changing its name to \u2018America\u2019 until U.S. electionNEW YORK \u2013 There\u2019s no trademark on America.Budweiser, now owned by Belgium\u2019s AB Inbev, will rename its beer \u201cAmerica\u201d this summer and alter its labels with images and phrases affiliated with the republic.The red, white and blue campaign is being launched into a very competitive market already foamy with craft beers, and upon a drinking public bracing itself for a presidential election likely to be unlike any before it.\u201cWe are embarking on what should be the most patriotic summer that this generation has ever seen, with Copa America Centenario being held on U.S. soil for the first time, Team USA competing at the Rio 2016, Olympic and Paralympic Games,\u201d said Ricardo Marques, vice-president at Budweiser.The Copa America Centenario is a ceremonial soccer tournament typically held in South America.', u'Staying active is key to longevity of world\u2019s oldest living cat: ownerMANSFIELD, Texas \u2013 A Siamese cat born during President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration has been named by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s oldest living cat.Guinness says Scooter celebrated his 30th birthday on March 26.

Four days later, battling a rare cancer, she went into the hospital and never left.Now, four of Catherine\u2019s friends are honouring her by wearing that dress to their own proms, a gracious gesture her mother named after \u201cTravelling Pants.\u201d And, like the pair of jeans in the books and movies that magically fits four teenage girls of different shapes and sizes, Catherine\u2019s dress works for all of them, with only temporary hemming for two of the girls.\u201cWhen each girl tried it on, it fit each one of them beautifully despite all having very different body types,\u201d said Catherine\u2019s mother, Jennifer Goodwin. \u201cIt is uncanny.\u201dThere won\u2019t be any scheduling conflicts; the girls go to different schools, and their proms are on different dates. Another friend of Catherine\u2019s already has asked to wear the dress to her prom next year, while Catherine\u2019s seventh-grade cousin has asked Goodwin to save it for her prom, years down the road.\u201cIt\u2019s a way of keeping her with me,\u201d said Jillian Danton, 17, who wore the dress to her junior prom at Arlington High School in April.Catherine was a bubbly girl with an easy self-confidence and a silly sense of humour. She loved to act in school plays, taught religious education to first-graders, gladly debated anyone on any topic, and was the life of the party.\u201cEveryone knew her as the nice girl who made people laugh,\u201d said Carly Blau, a friend from summer camp who plans to wear the dress to her senior prom next month at Beverly High.Catherine played field hockey and was on the Arlington High crew team. In autumn 2014, she told her parents she was having some pain in her shoulder. They thought it was an athletic injury, but after doctors\u2019 visits, they got the diagnosis: Catherine, 16, had epithelioid sarcoma, an aggressive cancer.She started chemotherapy the day after Christmas, then had radiation, then simultaneous courses of both. She also participated in a clinical trial. But the cancer had spread to her lungs and spine. She died Aug. 2, a little over two months after her prom.The idea for the travelling prom dress was born when Catherine\u2019s mother called Jillian about three months after Catherine died and asked if she would like to wear it to her prom.Two months later, Goodwin invited some of Catherine\u2019s other friends over to pick out something to remember her by. The girls saw the sleek blue prom dress hanging on her closet door.\u201cOne of us said, \u2018We should wear it to our proms,\u2019 and we all said, \u2018Catherine would love that,'\u201d said Emma Schambers, who plans to wear the dress to her senior prom in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, on May 13.The gown has a halter-style neckline that covered the port Catherine had for her medications.Catherine had lost her hair, so her mother bought a wig that a hairdresser styled into an updo that framed her face with a braid. A makeup artist evened out her skin tone, which had been dotted by acne caused by her treatments.Photos from that night show a blissful-looking girl with a glowing smile, even though she was frail after being released from the hospital just the night before.\u201cShe looked at me and said, \u2018Mom, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel beautiful,'\u201d Goodwin said.Through months of grueling cancer treatments, she had been forced to miss out on some important things in her life: the lead in a school play, a choral trip to Italy and a counsellor\u2019s job at summer camp. She pushed through, never complaining, her mother said.Some weeks, her mother drove her to school for a 7 a.m. chorus practice, then picked her up to take her to Boston for cancer treatments. After a nap, she\u2019d head back to school for afternoon classes. She ran for student council president and won.Lauren Hourican, a close friend from Arlington, recalled going to school dances with Catherine and watching her do \u201can absolutely insane kind of dancing.\u201d She plans to wear the dress to her senior prom May 20.\u201cShe\u2019ll be back out on the dance floor where she belongs,\u201d she said.", u'Gallery: Video, pictures of Fort McMurray wildfire damage media tourEDMONTON \u2013 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley says the \u201cocean of fire\u201d that hit Fort McMurray burned about 10 per cent of the buildings, but the hard work of firefighters saved the bulk of the city so it can be rebuilt.\u201cThe fast action and the hard work and the dedication and the smarts of these first responders has, it appears, saved almost 90 per cent of the city of First McMurray,\u201d she said Monday after a ground tour of the devastation.Notley and members of the media were taken to various parts of  Monday afternoon, to see firsthand the devastation left behind by a wildfire that continues to burn in the region.All 80,000 residents ordered out last Tuesday will have to wait at least two weeks to hear when they might be allowed to return.\xa0Regional fire Chief Darby Allen said the speed and rapid growth of last week\u2019s wildfire was unprecedented.\u201cI truly believe nothing else could have been done that wasn\u2019t done to protect the people and the structures within our city,\u201d said Allen. \u201cThey\u2019re rewriting their formulas on how fires behave based on this fire.\u201dDuring the tour, the bus passed by the Centennial Trailer Park on the way into Fort McMurray. While a few trailers were left standing, the majority of the park was destroyed.The first stop on the tour was the Beacon Hill neighbourhood, an area of Fort McMurray the province previously said was about 70 per cent destroyed by the wildfire.\u201cThis was a beast. It was an animal,\u201d Allen said of the fire as the bus left the Beacon Hill neighbourhood.Notley said 2,400 buildings were torched, but 25,000 were saved, including the hospital, municipal buildings and schools.After going through\xa0 Beacon Hill, the bus tour then drove through the city\u2019s core.\xa0Fire Hall 1 was not damaged. Much of the downtown and the water treatment plant are also intact.\xa0Sprinklers were used to keep the building from burning down, Allen said as he led the tour.\u201cThis city will emerge from this emergency with real structural resiliency with most of its critical infrastructure saved,\u201d said Notley.But Notley reiterated that the community is not yet safe for people to return.Hot spots remain and large sections of the city don\u2019t have power, gas or water. She said a plan is to be developed over the next two weeks for the orderly and safe return of residents.Evacuees have been out of their homes for a week under a mandatory evacuation order. They were forced to flee, some with just minutes notice, when a ravenous wildfire, pushed by shifting winds, overwhelmed several neighbourhoods in the south and southwest.Darby said between 40 and 50 per cent of Fort McMurray could have been destroyed if firefighters hadn\u2019t been able to hold back the flames at key points, especially the downtown.Heading down King Street and into downtown, the area was not affected by the wildfire; homes, gas stations and hotels in the area were still standing. The hospital, , was still standing. Darby said a great deal of effort went into keeping the fire away from the facility.Some of the hardest-hit areas are nothing more than acrid wastelands of soot, ash and concrete.Reporters who were also given a tour saw scorched skeletal outlines of furniture, vehicles and buildings.A cracked birdbath. The metal outline of a shed. A front doorstep leading to nowhere. Kids\u2019 bikes burned where they were chained up. Metal-topped barbecues with melted knobs on flame-streaked patios.Homes that appear not to have been touched now face craters just across the street. Pristine bus stops and mailboxes remain ready for business next to charred ruins.The dominant colours are blacks, greys, whites and ochre.The hazy skyline is punctuated by towering light poles and the odd tree: Tall, black and twisted with stubby twig arms.The Super8 motel is gone. Only the signature red-and-yellow sign remains.Cars and trucks remain torched where they were abandoned, their paint jobs blistered and cracked. Wheels are burned to blackened hubs, upholstery is consumed to the springs, windows are smashed and dashboards melted to hardened goo.It\u2019s a world of irregular shapes and fractured lines. Sections of jagged walls and brick rise from black-grey foundations like broken off sections of jigsaw puzzles.Walls, beams and posts lie folded and twisted on top of one another. Utility meters bend to the left and right. Trees droop. Blown-out top floor windows are open to the sky in both directions. Blackened washers and dryers sit like lonely cubes. Over there is a bathtub.There is wreckage everywhere.But there are signs reconstruction has begun.Teams work on power lines into the city, 435 kilometres northeast of Edmonton.The evacuees have been staying in hotels, campgrounds, with friends or at reception centres. The main one in Edmonton has had to deal with an added problem \u2014 .The wildfire sat at just over 2,000 square kilometres on Monday and moved within 30 kilometres of the Saskatchewan boundary. But lower than seasonal temperatures were giving crews a chance to extinguish hotspots in Fort McMurray.Across the country,  has collected $60 million in donations, including on Monday $250,000 from Atlantic Canada and $500,000 from Unifor, a union representing 4,000 oilsands workers.Allen said everything is being done to get people back to the community as soon as possible.\u201cWe are dedicating every necessary resource to bringing you home,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d', u'Unconventional Grade 6 homework assignment gets top marks from parentsA teacher in Britain\xa0at \xa0has re-ignited the homework debate with her now-viral weekend assignment for her Grade 6 students.Mrs. Thom\xa0explained that with exams coming up, it\u2019s vital for the kids to use their time wisely.So the first item on her list of 17\xa0tasks for the 11-year-olds\xa0was to,\xa0\u201cGo on a bike/scooter ride.\u201dSee friends, read a book, do something you\u2019ve never done before, and laugh until your tummy hurts were\xa0also\xa0assigned homework.Eat ice cream made\xa0the list twice.Her instructions were to \u201ccomplete as many of these activities as possible and tick to say they have been done.\u201dLouise Harry and her daughter were\xa0thrilled\xa0to follow the\xa0teacher\u2019s orders.\u201cWe have spent a happy day ticking lots of those boxes,\u201d the mother wrote on Facebook.The school\xa0supported\xa0Mrs. Thom\u2019s\xa0style of exam prep, saying on Monday it wants\xa0to foster well-rounded kids \u201cbalanced in mind, body and spirit.\u201dThe majority of parents who weighed in online complained\xa0of\xa0the long hours of homework their children were\xa0coming\xa0home with.Lucy Finch said she once sent a note back informing her child\u2019s school that the assignments were \u201cexcessive\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be completed.\u201cIn my previous job I used to take work home, then like many others decided enough was enough and stopped doing it,\u201d she wrote in a comment.\u201cThe\xa0infamous\xa0Chinese\xa0\u201cTiger Mom\u201d Amy Chua boasted in\xa0the \xa0in 2011 that she never allowed her daughters to do extra-curricular activities or watch TV (one of the activities\xa0Mrs. Thom suggested for her students).Chua credited their academic success to her strict parenting, and felt it best prepared them for the future.A Qu\xe9bec elementary school decided to do away with homework a couple years ago. The goal was\xa0to ease pressure on parents and possibly improve student performance.Nova Scotia for years had a ban on homework for students up to Grade 3. That , much to the relief of parents like Madonna Ryan.Michael MacDonald, an elementary school vice principal, said that teachers were\xa0encouraged by the new changes.\u201cI think teachers are happy students will have a chance to practice. And we know when students practice and come back to school that builds on their learning experience.\u201dIn Newmarket, Ont., a high school class was asked over the past year to do their homework at school and learn at home from pre-taped lessons.Teacher Donna Green said the flip\xa0allowed her to interact more with her students and let teens\xa0learn\xa0at their own pace at home.The method drew mixed reactions. One big drawback was\xa0that students couldn\u2019t ask questions when they didn\u2019t understand something in Green\u2019s\xa0recorded class.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to please all students.\u201d', u'Baby boxes in Philadelphia encourage safe sleeping for newbornsPHILADELPHIA \u2013 Doctors and nurses hope to lower the city\u2019s high infant mortality rate by distributing baby boxes that encourage safe sleeping habits for newborns and their caregivers.Temple University Hospital this week began giving out the cardboard boxes that are lined with a mattress and function like a bassinet. They\u2019re meant to discourage parents from sleeping with their babies, which could lead to accidental suffocation.The program is the largest effort of its kind by an academic health system in the U.S., hospital officials said, though that could not immediately be confirmed. It\u2019s based on a successful baby box initiative in Finland that began in the 1930s and lowered that country\u2019s infant mortality rate.At Temple, Brianna Devero received the first box a few days ago after her son, Steven Tonzelli Jr., was born. The boy arrived two weeks early \u2014 before her house was ready for the new arrival.\u201cHe loved it because it was like sleeping in the bassinet from the hospital,\u201d Devero said Friday. \u201cAnd it was really just good because it was something that I could use just right then and there, and didn\u2019t have to worry about assembling anything.\u201dPhiladelphia, which has one of the nation\u2019s highest poverty rates, has an infant mortality rate nearly double the U.S. average \u2014 11.2 deaths per 1,000 births compared with six per 1,000 nationwide, according to the city Health Department. The rate is even higher in some low-income neighbourhoods that Temple serves.Poor families sometimes don\u2019t have the resources or education to properly care for newborns. Temple\u2019s box initiative aims to reduce risky behaviour associated with infant deaths, such as sharing beds or using unsafe bedding.The hospital plans to give out 3,000 boxes for free over the next year \u2014 one for each woman who gives birth there, regardless of need. The boxes, which include clothing, diapers and educational materials, are worth $80 to $100 and were partly paid for with grants and crowdfunding, officials said.Temple patient Victoria Mack received a box Friday for her son Reign \u2014 who also arrived unexpectedly early.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that you have something that you can go home with \u2026 until when you finally have everything ready to go,\u201d she said.\xa0', u"Store clerk praised for reaction to autistic child\u2019s \u2018meltdown\u2019A grocery store meltdown gave a\xa0U.K. mom of two blind and autistic girls something to be grateful for.\u201cAs you can imagine, shopping is not an easy thing for me to do,\u201d Amanda Wilkins wrote in a  that\u2019s drawn close to 100,000 shares.The moment that she and parents of young kids everywhere dread happened on Saturday: both her girls had a meltdown\xa0in the checkout line.What made this time different\xa0is that rather than judge\xa0her and her daughters, the cashier\xa0decided to help.\u201cShe distracted my daughter by letting her scan all my shopping.\u201dWilkins wrote\xa0it was\xa0\u201ca dream come true\u201d for her daughter Holly, \u201cwho loves playing \u2018shops.'\u201dThe store, along with thousands of people around the world, has praised the cashier\u2019s actions.Meltdowns, which are , can be\xa0common among children with autism.Mawlam defined them\xa0as a\xa0physiological and mental reaction to stress, emotional or\xa0\xa0that can overwhelm the brain of someone who suffers from autism.\u201cStopping a meltdown just takes time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t something you can just stop.\u201dShe encourages parents who may find themselves in this situation to just do their best.

Many live in poverty, work two jobs or don\u2019t get paid leave to care for themselves or children if they get sick, she says.She called on leaders to rethink public and corporate policies to better support single mothers. She didn\u2019t say whether anything will change at Facebook, where she is chief operating officer.Sandberg\u2019s husband, Dave, died in a treadmill accident a year ago while on vacation in Mexico.Here are other thoughts she shared on single parenting, leave policies and her book:Sandberg says she never realized how often situations come up where she\u2019s unable to stop her son or daughter from crying. \u201cWhat would Dave do if he were here?\u201d she asks herself. Sandberg writes that she never realized how many events such as father-daughter dances there are at schools and how hard they are for children without dads.The U.S., Sandberg says, is the only developed economy in the world that does not provide workers paid maternity leave. She says we need to rethink policies to better support single mothers. The post doesn\u2019t address Facebook\u2019s own policies. Facebook does offer U.S. employees up to four months of paid parental leave.

The study also found the diet reduced the rate of bone loss for people with osteoporosis.The study was conducted in Europe with nearly 1,300 volunteers from Italy, France, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.The volunteers were both men and women, and they had a range of different physical qualities like genetics and body composition.Each volunteer was given a personally tailored Mediterranean-style diet.\u201cThis is the first project that goes in such depths into the effects of the Mediterranean diet on health of elderly population,\u201d project coordinator Claudio Franceschi or the University of Bologna in Italy said.\u201cWe are using the most powerful and advanced techniques \u2026 to understand what effect, the Mediterranean style diet has on the population of over 65 years old\u201dThe study is also looking at how the diet will affect insulin sensitivity, heart health, and quality of life, but those findings haven\u2019t yet been released.According to , the diet has many other health benefits including reducing your risk of heart disease.The diet emphasizes plant-based foods, as well as replacing butter with a healthy oil (such as canola or olive).\u201cGrains in the Mediterranean region are typically whole grain and usually contain very few unhealthy trans fats, and bread is an important part of the diet there,\u201d Mayo clinic staff explain on the website.\u201cHowever, throughout the Mediterranean region, bread is eaten plain or dipped in olive oil \u2014 not eaten with butter or margarines, which contain saturated or trans fats.\u201dIt also limits the intake of red meat to \u201cno more than a few times a month,\u201d \u201ceating fish and poultry at least twice a week,\u201d and recommends eating small amounts of unsalted or candied nuts as a source of unsaturated fats.Red wine is allowed, but only in moderation.It also recommends flavouring food with herbs and spices instead of salt.\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'5 destinations to visit before they disappearBefore we\xa0know it, some of the world\u2019s most beautiful and unique destinations will be unrecognizable because climate change, plastic pollution and overpopulation are having devastating effects on the\xa0planet.

Groundwater levels and general tourist traffic have also been creating some structural damage to the palace, which has led to whispers of public access being restricted in the near future.Ever wanted to dive with Nemo and Dori in the stunning Great Barrier Reef? You could be running out of time as rising ocean temperatures and an influx of pollution may mean this natural wonder is destroyed within the next 100 years. It\u2019s hard to believe, but every single piece of plastic ever created still exists today. Ninety per cent of all floating material in the ocean is made of the material\xa0and every year, millions of sea birds and hundreds of thousands of marine mammals mistake the plastic for food and die as a result.Who hasn\u2019t dreamt of a vacation taking place among the sapphire-blue seas of the spectacular Maldives? Sadly, the beautiful island nation could be completely engulfed by water within the next 100 years.

The fundraiser gathered $100,000 for relief efforts.Mayor Don Iveson, Ward 3 Councillor Dave Loken, Edmonton- Riverbend MP Matt Jeneroux and Rona Ambrose, Sturgeon River \u2013 Parkland MP and Interim Conservative Party leader, were all helping serve food.Donations for Emergency Relief Services were also accepted.', u"Some older couples have \u2018weddings\u2019 without getting marriedSome older couples who want social recognition for their love relationships are exchanging rings, throwing parties and holding wedding-type ceremonies, but they\u2019re stopping short of getting legally married to avoid complications with retirement funds, property and grown children.\u201cIt was important for our friends to know we were committed to each other,\u201d recalled Dixie Reppe, 80, who wears a ring from her beau, Joe Pendergraft, 77, and refers to him as her fiance. \u201cBut the financial piece and the families \u2014 it\u2019s a whole lot more complicated. We decided to keep those things separate.\u201dThe two live in adjoining apartments in Inverness Village in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Pendergraft bought her the ring after she visited him in Georgia. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want people to think I\u2019d spent time with a strange man in Georgia,\u201d Reppe recalled with a laugh.Once word got out about their relationship, \u201cwe weren\u2019t sure how well accepted that would be,\u201d said Reppe. She needn\u2019t have worried: Her girlfriends threw her a surprise engagement party, and there were a few other informal gatherings with Champagne, chocolate and friends, where they could introduce themselves as a couple.One benefit of formalizing a relationship this way is that it allows older couples to dispense with terms like \u201cboyfriend\u201d or \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d which might be fine for 20-somethings, but can raise eyebrows among the 70- and 80-something set.Sapp and Oxenhardt, both in their 70s, were widowed when they met, and each had two grown children. Those children were among 90 guests at their 2013 wedding ceremony in Missouri, complete with a pastor.\u201cIt was just like any other marriage ceremony, except we didn\u2019t have the last sentence where the minister will say, \u2018By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife,'\u201d Sapp recalled. \u201cHe was a really cool pastor, and when we told him our story, he said, \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll do it.'\u201dBut while avoiding marriage may seem like an easy way to keep finances and estates separate, unmarried couples may still face some legal complications, according to Frederick Hertz, a California lawyer and co-author of \u201cLiving Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples.\u201dHertz noted that some states honour common-law marriage and will consider couples married after a number of years whether or not they got a marriage license, while other states allow unmarried partners to claim money or property \u201cbased on an oral or implied agreement.\u201dHertz also said that signing a credit card or lease with your partner could make you responsible for the other person\u2019s debt. Other issues include who has legal authority for medical decisions, and when one partner dies, whether a surviving partner has the right to stay in the home where they lived together. That may depend on who owns it and who inherits it.Housing is one thing Reppe and Pendergraft thought about early on. When they met, Reppe was living at Inverness Village in a unit that was too small for both of them. When the unit next door opened up, they \u201cbasically blew a hole through the wall and got the apartments connected,\u201d she said. This way they have their own apartments, but they can also be together, and if something happens to one of them, the other will still have a place to live.Sapp and Oxenhardt also own separate homes where they spend time together. She owns the villa in Florida where they spend winters, and he owns the house in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, where they live in the warm months. Their retirement finances are separate too: She worked for the Veterans Administration, and he has a pension from the railroads.But whatever arrangements older couples make as they manage the logistics or social conventions of being together, the love and companionship they share makes it all worthwhile.\u201cI think when you get to this stage in life, if you found happiness, when you find someone to love and someone who loves you and you can share so many common interests and you don\u2019t have to come home to an empty apartment, that\u2019s pretty special,\u201d said Reppe.\u201cWe laugh a lot,\u201d Pendergraft said.", u'Strangers help bride who lost dress in Fort McMurray wildfireThe\xa0last few days before a\xa0wedding can be stressful.

Instead she and her fiance, along with over 80,000 others, were evacuated from their city.The couple was able to make it safely to Toronto on Thursday. It\u2019s the halfway point between her family on the East Coast and friends in Alberta; it\u2019s\xa0where the two are set to tie the knot\xa0this weekend.With just a couple days before the big day, the dressless bride-to-be asked\xa0her Toronto photographer for help.\u201cI know it seems so petty but I couldn\u2019t wait to wear my dress.

She wasn\u2019t even able to make it home before the evacuation.Boissonneault doesn\u2019t know if her own home will still be standing when she gets back.

That\u2019s the third year on top for Noah and the second in a row for Emma, which was also No. 1 in 2008.The administration released its annual list of top baby names Friday, and the top five names for girls and boys in 2015 remained unchanged from the previous year. Noah was followed by Liam, Mason, Jacob and William. Emma was followed by Olivia, Sophia, Ava and Isabella. Ava and Isabella switched spots from 2014, with Ava climbing to number 4.One major change was the girls\u2019 name Isis, which had remained steadily in the middle of the pack of the country\u2019s top 1,000 names for the last 15 years. In 2015, after the name had emerged as an acronym for the extremist group Islamic State, it dropped completely off the list.That\u2019s a dramatic shift, says Laura Wattenberg, baby name expert and founder of .\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite rare for a name to be eliminated by issues in the news,\u201d she says, noting that the name Adolph was still at No. 555 in the U.S. at the end of World War II when the Nazis and Adolf Hitler fell.There\u2019s another recent example, though: the name Hillary dropped off the list in 2009, a year after Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic presidential primary to Barack Obama. The name was No. 721 in 2008. Hillary remained off the list this year, as did the name of her current Democratic primary opponent, Bernie, as in Sanders.Barack has never appeared in the top 1,000 names, and the popularity of the name of Obama\u2019s predecessor, President George W. Bush, dropped slightly during his eight-year presidency, from No. 130 to No. 163.The first name of this year\u2019s presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, also dropped in 2015, from No. 418 to No. 441.Wattenberg said that unlike in the past, parents avoid politics in name choices today. But names of past presidents remain popular.Emma\u2019s popularity soared in 2002, the same year that Rachel, a character played by Jennifer Aniston on the TV show \u201cFriends,\u201d named her baby Emma. Also boosting the name, actress Emma Watson played Hermione Granger in the popular Harry Potter movies.Emma has been ranked among the top three baby names for girls since 2003, first reaching No. 1 in 2008. In 2013, Emma was No. 2 behind Sophia.For several years, trends have favoured names that are short and smooth \u2014 Mia, Liam and Noah \u2014 and that have a lot of vowels.Two girls\u2019 names that skyrocketed in popularity in 2015 were Alaia and Adaline, illustrating that vowel trend. Alaia moved up more than 2,000 spots on the list, from No. 2,676 to No. 664.The reasons for Alaia\u2019s rise aren\u2019t clear.\u201cPerhaps this can be attributed to high-fashion designer Azzedine Alaia, or maybe it is because of Alaia Baldwin, the model/daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin,\u201d speculated the Social Security Administration in a news release.The name Adaline moved from No. 1,393 to No. 364. \u201cThe Age of Adaline\u201d was a 2015 movie starring Blake Lively.For boys, the top-rising name is Riaan, which moved from No. 2,286 to No. 926. It\u2019s the name of the young son of a well-known Bollywood actor, Riteish Deshmukh.The Social Security Administration\u2019s website provides lists of the top 1,000 baby names for each year, dating to 1880. The top baby names that year were John and Mary. John is now No. 26 and Mary has fallen to No. 124.', u'3 tips for a better, easier breakfast in bed on Mother\u2019s DayBreakfast in bed is a love language in our home. Anytime there is a special occasion to celebrate \u2014 a birthday, Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, whatever \u2014 the rest of the family follows an unspoken agreement to meet early in the kitchen to craft a breakfast-in-bed tray. I\u2019m always first to the kitchen, and as I get the project rolling my daughters show up one at a time, bleary-eyed and clutching handmade crafts or cards and some flowers picked from the garden.As the team leader for many of the breakfasts our family has orchestrated over the years, I\u2019ve developed a few best practices. Do the bulk of the work the night before. Overnight breakfast recipes are key. The (critical) decorating of the tray with small kiddos sucks up a surprising amount of time, leaving precious little space for complex recipe execution in the morning. Serve something a little special. Stepping outside the routine breakfast menu has incredible power to make the whole morning feel like a party. Keep in mind the logistics of eating off a tray while mostly reclined in bed. Cereal, aside from breaking rule No. 2, is just about impossible to eat in bed without spilling. And while you don\u2019t need to be limited to finger food, think twice before getting too cozy with messy and liquid-based meal ideas. (It takes weeks for the smell of maple syrup to leave a comforter after a serious spill. Listen to the voice of experience on this one.)So what dish covers all these bases? And is healthy? Egg strata, which layers bread, eggs, meat and veggies all in one dish. I make mine in a muffin tin, which results in perfect portioning, pretty presentation and the flexibility to pick up breakfast with your hands or use a fork and knife. I use white whole-grain bread and a combination of eggs and egg whites to keep the nutrient profile reasonable. So even your morning breakfast party can boost your day with protein and fiber.Start to finish: 45 minutes, plus overnight chillingServings: 8Cut the crusts off the bread, then cut the crusts into 1/2-inch cubes and set aside.Use the palm of your hand to lightly press the slices of bread flat, making them thin and a little doughy. Coat the cups of a muffin pan with cooking spray, then gently press 1 slice into each cup, creating 8 little crusts. Set aside.In a medium saute pan over medium-high, cook the sausage, crumbling with a spoon, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and mushrooms and cook until fragrant, about another minute. Add the spinach, cream cheese and salsa, then cook for another 2 minutes (the mushrooms will not be fully cooked). Remove from the heat and stir in the mustard. Allow to cool for several minutes.In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg whites and milk until frothy. Add the slightly cooled mushroom and sausage mixture and stir to combine. Season with generous pinches each of salt and pepper. Place a few cubes of bread crust in each muffin cup, then spoon the egg mixture on top. You may not need all of the bread crusts. Lay 1 slice of tomato on top of each tart, then 1/2 tablespoon of cheese over that.Cover the muffin tray with foil and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. When you are ready to serve, heat the oven to 350 F. Bake for 15 minutes covered, then remove the foil and continue baking until the eggs are firm, another 10 to 15 minutes. 170 calories; 50 calories from fat (29 per cent of total calories); 6 g fat (2.5 g saturated; 0 g trans fats); 75 mg cholesterol; 430 mg sodium; 19 g carbohydrate; 2 g fiber; 5 g sugar; 10 g protein.___', u'Mother\u2019s Day: These TV personalities share their funny and sweet mom memoriesWith  around the corner, we asked some of our TV personalities to share their favourite mom memories to pay tribute to all the moms out there.\xa0Here\u2019s what they had to say:This may not be all that funny to some, but since becoming a mom, I\u2019ve discovered that my children have a knack for searching out my face at the very moment they\u2019re going to be sick. I\u2019m not talking a cold type of sick. I\u2019m talking projectile vomit, sick. It happened when they were babies. While in my arms their nearest target would always seem to be my bewildered face staring down at them and then again just recently at the movies, when my four-year-old said \u201cmommy,\u201d and as I leaned-in so that he can whisper to me, WHAM projectile splatter once again hit me square in the face.I\u2019ve come to realize motherhood isn\u2019t the most glamorous of jobs, but it sure keeps your face exfoliated! On this Mothers\u2019 Day, here\u2019s to all the mamas out there who keep braving the (chunky) elements with open arms.My mom makes the hard stuff look easy and it\u2019s not just juggling her job and home life. \xa0She\u2019s made everything from wedding dresses to tables. She can even fix fences, operate Microsoft Excel (forever a mystery to me) and is a pro at gardening, canning, knitting and more. I\u2019ve burned my hand with hot glue trying to keep up and demolished my kitchen making a mess out of one of her so-called easy recipes. Now that I have a daughter of my own, it blows me away that she did all of this while also running a farm with my dad. I hope I\u2019m able to be half the mom she is!When I was younger I had a Tickle Me Elmo. Every time my mom saw Elmo, she would freak out. Elmo\u2019s eyes gave her nightmares and we would always sneak up on her with Elmo. Hehehe, mean kids! My mom has a great sense of humour but what stands out to everyone who knows her is how much she cares for her loved ones, particularly through food. Growing up my mom made the most amazing school lunches for my siblings and me. Each day you could count on a gourmet sandwich, homemade cookies & fresh fruit, at the very least. Her lunches were so delicious they had a reputation among our friends. Mom\u2019s chocolate chip cookies were legendary and her bagel sandwiches were so good, my brother\u2019s best friend would request one for his birthday every year. To this day, mom\u2019s cookies rarely last more than 24 hours!Like most mothers, I find myself surprised at how often I sound like my own mother! How does it happen? I guess it makes sense really, your parents are the biggest influence in your life so of course there are remarkable similarities.My mom always made me feel like whatever I did was extra special, when clearly it wasn\u2019t always special or perfect. Keep in mind this was so long ago, it was back in the days of \u201cwinners and losers\u201d. I remember getting a C+ on a project and she still tried to insist it was probably the best in class. I was a teenager then and told her she didn\u2019t have to keep trying to \u201cprop\u201d me up.As it turns out, I think that the undeniable and unwavering support when I was a child contributed to my success as an adult. I hope I give my son that same sense of confidence!\xa0Happy Mother\u2019s Day!Jill Krop is the Station Manager & News Director of Global News BC', u'Moving in together? Tips for couples blending 2 homes into 1For couples setting up a new home together, it\u2019s a challenge: how to merge two sets of stuff and two decorating styles into one space they both can love.\u201cEmotions get really high when it comes to your belongings if the person you\u2019re choosing to spend the rest of your life with doesn\u2019t love what you love,\u201d says stylist Marianne Canada, host of the \u201cHGTV Crafternoon\u201d web series.In our increasingly design-savvy world, many people come to coupledom with a clear idea of how their home should look. Even when couples try to accommodate conflicting tastes, they run into the space issue.\u201cMost of us just don\u2019t have room for two full households together,\u201d Canada says.Here, Canada and two other interior designers \u2014 California-based Betsy Burnham and Florida-based Laura Burleson \u2014 offer advice on mixing, matching and peacefully negotiating a merger of two homes.Each person probably has a few treasured pieces of furniture or art that they can\u2019t imagine living without. Burnham suggests that partners agree to each keep perhaps three or four of these pieces in their shared home. If one partner truly dislikes one of the other\u2019s absolute favourites, consider changing the piece a little through painting or reupholstering.Burleson cites one couple who disagreed over a set of cane-backed dining chairs. The solution: lacquering the chairs in a dramatic shade of charcoal grey that matched a modern, concrete and brass dining table.\u201cIt takes repurposing things like that for people to look at them in a new way,\u201d Burleson says.Burham agrees, and says this creative approach can work with almost any piece of furniture: For example, \u201cif she\u2019s always had a floral chair she likes to read in,\u201d says Burnham, keep it but recover it in a more neutral fabric that both partners agree on.Once those favourite pieces are chosen, Burnham suggests creating a clean slate by painting the walls a crisp white or a white shade with just a hint of colour. Then look at all the remaining furniture against this new backdrop as though you were shopping.Rather than trying to group items that are similar, experiment with pairing those that contrast. All three designers say contrast can be the best part of decor. In fact, couples merging two households \u201chave such a leg up, design-wise,\u201d says Burleson, because they can creatively mix and layer a wide range of decor into one stylish space.And doing so can result in decor \u201cthat feels more collected and intentional.\u201dAs you assess your remaining furniture and accessories, consider placing things in rooms where they\u2019ve never been.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make that big leather recliner work in your traditional living room,\u201d Canada says, even if that\u2019s where it\u2019s always been. What about using it in your bedroom for late-night reading?Small dressers can serve as end tables or sideboards, while end tables can be used as bedside tables. Living room seating can make a guest room cozier, while a small kitchen table can add extra dining space to a family room.Burleson finds that older clients marrying for the second time tend to be more open to embracing new locations for favourite things.Buying a few new pieces can tie together a couple\u2019s shared decor and help both partners feel at home. \u201cMaybe they go shopping,\u201d Burnham says, \u201cand they find some great vintage rugs that neither one of them knew they loved.\u201dThis includes accessories and artwork: Canada suggests buying one powerful piece of art to be a focal point in your newly shared space.Couples may want to ask a friend or hire a designer to suggest specific new pieces that will tie their collective belongings together effectively.And if they really can\u2019t reach agreement, Canada says, \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in selling your furniture and going out together and buying new pieces as a couple.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Pet owners desperate to save animals left behindThe \xa0forced countless residents to leave behind their pets in the burning city Tuesday\xa0afternoon.\u201cThey are like family,\u201d said Laura\xa0Gislason of her 16-year-old dog Gabi and her five-year-old cat Pastel.The 25-year-old\xa0was running errands downtown when people started closing their stores and fleeing\xa0the city.

And the best place to start is with your local flower farmer or farmer\u2019s market.\u201cIt\u2019s important to consider the setting before deciding on the arrangement. Mason jars are great, but they wouldn\u2019t work at the Waldorf,\u201d said Chezar, who has designed floral arrangements for hundreds of weddings as well as for the White House.She is co-author with Julie Michaels of the new \u201c\u201d (Ten Speed Press, March 2016), which has tips on everything from textures and colours to foliage and containers. It includes step-by-step instructions for more than 45 floral projects.Another important factor in selecting flowers and arrangements is which colours suit the bride, Chezar said in an interview from her home in upstate New York.But the most crucial element is finding out what flowers are in season in the vicinity of the wedding, said Chezar, who is also a flower grower.\u201cAbout 80 per cent of the flowers used in the U.S. come from abroad, and there\u2019s a real interest now in using locally grown flowers,\u201d she said.\u201cJust as there is a \u2018slow food\u2019 movement, there is also a \u2018slow flowers\u2019 movement,\u201d she explained, and local or foraged varieties are \u201cvery much the look du jour pretty much anywhere you go.\u201dDebra Prinzing of Seattle, who launched the site two years ago, said: \u201cFarmers who sell to the public are an incredibly useful resource for brides, a real repository of knowledge. And the ethos of local, or at least U.S. sourcing is something brides really want these days.\u201dFarmers know what\u2019s in season, and having a story behind the flowers at your wedding \u2014 a sort of provenance \u2014 adds to the event, said Prinzing, who adds stationery tags to centerpieces for local weddings telling where the flowers were grown and what variety they are.\u201cIt\u2019s a cultural pivot toward local sourcing for all things. And in terms of the esthetic, it\u2019s a mindset of looking for all things seasonal and natural,\u201d she said.Chezar says that look can be attained through a generous use of foliage, branches and vines, as opposed to \u201cjust stuffing the flowers together tightly. People don\u2019t necessarily think about the foliage, but it\u2019s what breaks up and highlights the flowers and gives them a more natural look.Containers are also important.\u201cThe idea is to let things extend beyond the edge of a vase, to give a sense of movement and direction. Cylindrical vases are the least friendly to this because they are too vertical. Urns or bowls or anything that allows flowers to extend outward is much more wonderful to work with,\u201d Chezar says.Besides flower growers and farmers markets, she said, \u201canother great resource is nurseries. If you don\u2019t want to deal with cut flowers, you can have a mass of pansies in a pot. Nice containers elevate even humble plants to something more elegant, and a plant is almost always cheaper than cut flowers, plus it lasts.\u201dShe warned, however, that those trying to make their own wedding centerpieces should think carefully before deciding to do so.\u201cNobody realizes how much work it takes to do your own flowers,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can do it the last week. You need to plan way ahead, do some research to get a sense of what\u2019s going to be available when you\u2019ll be needing it, put together an idea board of varieties and colours, and practice doing it ahead of the event itself.\u201dFor those who do opt for creative homemade arrangements, there are infinite options.\u201cI\u2019ve found wild grapevines contorted in shapes I could never reproduce, fiddlehead ferns unfurling with the day, and spiky chestnuts still green on the tree. Take advantage of generous gifts like these,\u201d Chezar writes in her book. \u201cThey are nothing you can plan, but they can make all the difference between an ordinary arrangement and one that turns heads.\u201d', u'Interracial Old Navy ad spurs negative reaction, Canadian model speaks outLast week,   a photo of an interracial family wearing the company\u2019s clothing in the hopes of directing\xa0customers to an appreciation sale.What happened instead was some unanticipated\xa0negative attention on social media, with many people even threatening to boycott the retailer for using an interracial family in their ads. Here\u2019s the photo:\u201cMy family and I will never step into an Old Navy store again,\u201d one person tweeted in response to the ad.Another said: \u201cInterracial relationships are a fraction of U.S. marriages.

In the commercial, the biracial daughter asks her Caucasian\xa0mother about the cereal\u2019s heart-healthy benefits. Then she runs over to her African-American\xa0father and dumps the box of Cheerios onto his chest.The commercial received such backlash that General Mills had to disable the comments section under the YouTube video.After all the attention, Cheerios featured the family in another commercial that aired during the Super Bowl that year.Similarly, Twitter users were also quick to defend Old Navy.Many people responded to the tweet with images of their own interracial families., the pretend mother in the Old Navy ad, posted her own response to the controversy on Instagram.Mahary is from Edmonton, Alta. and has modelled for Victoria\u2019s Secret, Yves Saint Laurent and Balmain, among many others.In the caption of the photo, Mahary says,Clay Pollioni, the model father in the advertisement, also posted to Instagram to speak about all the controversy.In his caption he writes,\xa0The racism was addressed in a statement from Debbie Feliex, Old Navy spokesperson, to \xa0magazine.\u201cWe are a brand with a proud history of championing diversity and inclusion.

It measured 1,109 carats, the second-largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered. Its name means \u201cour light\u201d in the Tswana language of southern Africa.The auctioneer said the rough gemstone \u201cof exceptional transparency\u201d could yield the largest top-quality diamond ever cut and polished.David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby\u2019s jewelry division, called the discovery \u201cthe find of a lifetime\u201d and the auction unprecedented, because no rough diamond of this size has ever been auctioned.\u201cWe put an estimate on it in excess of $70 million, so that is the sort of area we are expecting to go for, but frankly it is difficult to tell \u2014 what is the largest diamond in the world worth?\u201d he said.The Royal Collection Trust, which oversees British royal treasures, says the largest gem-quality diamond ever found was the 3,106-carat Cullinan diamond, unearthed in South Africa in 1905. It was cut into nine pieces that form part of the U.K. Crown Jewels.The Lesedi la Rona could smash the record price for a diamond of $48.5 million, paid at a Geneva sale last year for the 12.03-carat polished \u201cBlue Moon\u201d diamond. Hong Kong billionaire Joseph Lau picked it up as a gift for his 7-year-old daughter.The Lesedi la Rona diamond will be on public display at Sotheby\u2019s in New York on Saturday, and at the auctioneer\u2019s London showrooms June 18-28.']

[u'Jury sides with Google in battle over Android softwareSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s Android software just dodged a $9 billion bullet.A federal jury found Thursday that Google didn\u2019t need permission to use a rival\u2019s programming tools as it built Android \u2014 now the world\u2019s leading smartphone operating software and a key part of Google\u2019s multi-billion dollar Internet business.Software competitor Oracle claimed Google had stolen its intellectual property and reaped huge profits by copying pieces of an Oracle programming language called Java. But the jury in U.S. District Court found that Google made \u201cfair use,\u201d under copyright law, of Java elements that help different software programs work together.Oracle, which had sought $9 billion in damages, immediately said it would appeal.The verdict was closely watched in Silicon Valley, in part because many popular features of today\u2019s smartphones only work because apps can \u201ctalk\u201d to one another or the phone\u2019s underlying software. Google\u2019s supporters \u2014 a group that included other tech firms, trade associations and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet rights group \u2014 warned that an Oracle victory would hamper future innovation by making that software cooperation more difficult and expensive.Google argued that because it used only a small part of Java to create Android, a much larger system of software built for a new purpose, it qualified for a \u201cfair use\u201d exemption from copyright. Similar exemptions allow artists and critics to quote or reuse small portions of someone else\u2019s work in a larger essay or creation.Oracle and its allies simply argued that the company should be paid for the use of its code. While Google lets smartphone manufacturers use Android software without charge, it makes billions of dollars by showing advertising to people who use Google services, including its popular search engine and maps, on Android phones and tablets.The high-profile dispute was a clash of Silicon Valley titans. While much of the trial focused on arcane aspects of computer programming, jurors heard testimony from prominent tech executives and a pair of multi-billionaire moguls. Google co-founder Larry Page testified in person, while Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison appeared on video.Jurors also got a glimpse of Silicon Valley\u2019s small world when they heard from Eric Schmidt, now chairman of Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Schmidt was an executive of Sun Microsystems when that company created Java. Oracle acquired the rights to Java when it bought Sun in 2010.The jury\u2019s verdict marks Google\u2019s second victory in the case. U.S. Judge William Alsup sided with Google in 2012, ruling that the APIs weren\u2019t protected by copyright. An appellate court overturned Alsup\u2019s ruling and sent the case back for a second trial.Oracle said it will appeal the latest verdict on \u201cnumerous grounds.\u201d In a statement, Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley added, \u201cWe strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market.\u201dGoogle welcomed the jury\u2019s finding in its own statement.\u201cToday\u2019s verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products,\u201d the company said.', u'Researchers develop wheelchair controlled by facial expressionsResearchers at a Brazilian robotics have developed technology that\xa0allows a person to control a wheelchair with simple facial expressions., a S\xe3o Paulo-based company, saw a gap in the market for wheelchair users who needed an efficient hands-free option that didn\u2019t require sensors or contraptions attached to the user\u2019s body.\u201cWe compared technologies developed 10 years ago to technologies today and we noticed that the improvements were not so significant,\u201d wrote\xa0HOOBOX CEO Paulo Pinheiro\xa0in an email to Global News.The  uses a laptop or tablet hooked up to a facial recognition camera which reads 80 points on a human face. So far, the technology recognizes eight expressions which can each be assigned to a certain movement\xa0or to stop the wheelchair.Pinheiro said the user can still maintain \u201cmoderate conversation\u201d without interrupting the operation of the Wheelie and said the second generation prototype is already able to recognize voice commands, head and iris movements. Functions such as the voice command can toggle the interface\xa0on and off if the user wants to stop and engage in an expressive conversation.The company said it has already received its first round of funding from investors and expects the first Wheelie model to be on the market by the end of 2018.', u'Mean girls: Half of misogynistic tweets are sent by women, study showsMen are often blamed for most\xa0of the harassment women face online, but a new study shows that women themselves are responsible for half of the misogynistic comments made on social media. using an algorithm to weed out tweets that used the words in conversational tone or to discuss issues surrounding misogyny.Researchers found that 6,500 unique users in the U.K. were targeted with 10,000 misogynistic or aggressive tweets. Internationally, over 200,000 aggressive tweets using the same terms were sent to 80,000 people.But here\u2019s the twist \u2013 the study found 50 per cent of those aggressive tweets were sent by female users.\u201cThis study provides a bird\u2019s-eye snapshot of what is ultimately a very personal and often traumatic experience for women,\u201d said Alex Krasodomski-Jones, one of the researchers on the project.The fact that women often face abuse online is nothing new \u2013 an Australian report published in March found that nearly half of women have experienced harassment online; a Pew Research study found that number to be even higher at 73 per cent.But a lot of the stories surrounding that abuse have focused on men harassing women.Take for example  \u2013 the 2014 movement surrounding sexism and the harassment female gamers face from their male counterparts.Or last month\u2019s viral video that showed real men reading hateful, explicit and abusive comments sent to two female sports reporters \u2013 including lines like, \u201cI hope your boyfriend beats you,\u201d and \u201cLike the whore that you are.\u201dHowever, this study suggests that the \u201cMean Girls\u201d club is very much alive online.', u'State Department audit says Hillary Clinton violated email rulesWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton disregarded various State Department guidelines for avoiding cybersecurity risks, an internal audit found Wednesday, faulting her and past secretaries of state for weak information management.The inspector general\u2019s 78-page analysis, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, cites \u201clongstanding, systemic weaknesses\u201d related to the agency\u2019s communications. These started before Clinton\u2019s appointment as secretary of state, but her failures were singled out as more serious.Despite guidelines to the contrary and never seeking approval, Clinton used mobile devices to conduct official business on her personal email account and private server. She never sought approval from senior information officers, who would have refused the request because of security risks, the audit said.The review was prompted by the revelations of Clinton\u2019s email use, which has affected her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nevertheless, the review also encompassed the email and information practices of the last five secretaries.The report said the department and its secretaries were \u201cslow to recognize and to manage effectively the legal requirements and cybersecurity risks associated with electronic data communications, particularly as those risks pertain to its most senior leadership.\u201dClinton has been dogged by questions about her email practices for more than a year, since AP revealed that the clintonemail.com server was in the basement of Clinton\u2019s New York home while she served as the nation\u2019s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.Separately from the State Department audit, FBI agents have been probing whether Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server imperiled government secrets.Clinton has acknowledged in the campaign that her homebrew email setup was a mistake, but said she never sent or received anything marked classified at the time.', u'Tesla Motors to \u2018massively\u2019 expand supercharger network in Ontario and QuebecTesla Motors is giving its network of high-powered charging stations in Ontario and Quebec a serious jolt.The California-based carmaker announced Wednesday it plans to add five new charging locations to the 10 already installed in eastern Canada by the end of the summer.Telsa recently opened its latest station in Grimbsy, Ont. last week which it says will allow drivers to travel between west New York, Niagara Falls, and into Toronto and Detroit.The new stations announced on Wednesday include Huntsville and Parry Sound in Ontario and Magog, Montreal and Riviere du Loup in Quebec.Telsa says a supercharger station can add up to 200 km of range in as little as 20 minutes of charging.There are currently 18 supercharger stations across Canada \u2014 six in British Columbia, two in Alberta, eight in Ontario and two in Quebec.Tesla says it currently has more than 600 supercharger stations and over 3,000 connectors worldwide.Pre-orders for Tesla Model 3, a vehicle being marketed to the general consumer with a starting price of US$35,000, has already reached over 320,000 and worth an estimated US$14 billion.Production for the highly sought after electric vehicle model won\u2019t go into production until the end of 2017.', u'IN PHOTOS: Climber documents journey to Everest summit on SnapchatAlpinist and photojournalist  successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest Monday, smartphone in hand.Despite a deadly week on the world\u2019s highest mountain, the climber managed to make the climb without the help of supplemental oxygen and documented the entire climb on Snapchat. Richards and his climbing partner Adrian Ballinger shared images and videos of their journey on Snapchat, offering a firsthand glimpse at the beauty of a mountain with a deadly history. Four climbers have died on Everest in the past four days alone, According to the latest update on Snapchat, Richards began his descent from the summit of Everest early Tuesday. He made the entire journey without supplemental oxygen.Most climbers use supplemental oxygen due to the low levels of gas in the high-altitude air.Ballinger did not make it to the summit; he elected to turn around and begin using oxygen mid-way to the summit. But Richards isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. Many people become sick, some fatally, while making the descent from the summit.On Saturday, Australian Maria Strydom died after developing altitude sickness while descending the mountain. The 34-year-old climbed the mountain to prove that her vegan diet was enough to get her through the trek. In 2014, an avalanche killed 16 Sherpa guides near the base camp. Last year, another avalanche triggered by a powerful earthquake, killed 19 climbers and injured 16 others.', u'Tragically Hip fans share lyrics, messages of hope after Gord Downie cancer diagnosisFans of Canadian rock legend Gord Downie and The Tragically Hip took to social media Tuesday to share messages of heartbreak, admiration and hope after the band revealed Downie was diagnosed with terminal brain caner in December.In a letter addressed to fans, the band said their frontman\xa0has been fighting hard over the last few months with friends and family by his side. It\u2019s unclear whether Downie is undergoing treatment for the cancer; however, an update on his condition is scheduled to take place at\xa0Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto at 11 a.m. ET.\u201cThe news about Gord Downie makes me feel like I just found out a good friend is dying,\u201d said one Twitter user.Along with messages of hope and well wishes, many fans took to social media to share their favourite Tragically Hip lyrics and Downie quotes.The news comes as a hard blow for fans of The Hip; many of whom consider Downie to be\xa0the personification of the Canadian spirit.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe Kingston, Ont., band formed in 1984 and launched their self-titled debut EP in 1987.

But the social networking juggernaut maintains there is \u201cno evidence of systematic political bias.\u201dIn , Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said it took swift action to address allegations it \u201c\u201d news stories and topics that might be of interest to conservative Facebook users while tampering with its algorithm to promote other topics that weren\u2019t necessarily trending.\u201cOur data analysis indicated that conservative and liberal topics are approved as trending topics at virtually identical rates,\u201d read the statement, following an internal investigation and a meeting last week between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and John Thune, chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee.The claims were first made in a May 9 article on the tech website  (an arm of Gawker media).Trending topics were introduced in 2014 and appear in a separate section to the right of the Facebook newsfeed. According to Facebook, potential trending topics are first determined by a software formula, or algorithm, that identifies topics that have spiked in popularity on the site.The Gizmodo article alleged the Trending Topics section \u201coperates like a traditional newsroom, reflecting the biases of its workers and the institutional imperatives of the corporation.\u201dGizmodo cited an anonymous former news curator who identified as \u201cpolitically conservative.\u201d The purported former employee reportedly said topics were elected \u201csubjectively\u201d depending on employee shifts.Facebook admitted it was possible there may be \u201cisolated improper actions or unintentional bias\u201d and, as such, would implement a number of improvements \u2014 including more employee training and greater oversight and review.Facebook also promised to cease relying on \u201clists of external websites and news outlets to identify, validate or assess the importance of particular topics.\u201d That lists also included several conservative-oriented media such as Fox News, the Daily Caller, the Drudge Report, the , and Beck\u2019s website The Blaze.In a letter to Senate Committee Chairman Thune, Stretch addressed specific content that Facebook allegedly sidelined, including posts about Romney, Cruz and Beck, as well as posts about late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle \u2014 the subject of the film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d.', u'How knowing how much homes sell for could make it easier for you to buy a home in CanadaBuying a home may soon be a bit less stressful for Canadians\xa0thanks to a\xa0precedent-setting ruling that could force real estate boards to hand over data on home sales and in turn make buying a home more transparent.In April, \xa0in a long-standing dispute over access to home sales data. The tribunal ruled the TREB\xa0was creating unfair competition and keeping prices high by keeping data \u2013 like how much money a\xa0home sold for \u2013 private.By only providing that data to personal clients, the tribunal ruled  \u201cnew and innovative real estate brokerage services using the Internet.\u201dTREB maintains that it limits access to this data to ensure the privacy of its buyers and sellers.While it\u2019s not yet clear what type of data will be released, many brokerages believe the ruling could set a precedent for other real estate boards in Canada to release their home sales data.And that has the potential to make the entire home buying experience a lot less stressful for Canadians.Currently, Canadian real estate sales data isn\u2019t very \u201cGoogle-able.\u201d \xa0From trip planning, to finding a new restaurant for dinner, nearly everyone takes to the Internet, or an app, to research before committing to an idea (especially when money is involved).Sure, it\u2019s easy enough to look up list prices for houses in your preferred neighbourhood \u2013 but what you really want to know is the final selling price of those houses.This is especially important in  \u2013 Toronto and Vancouver \u2013 , where homes are purposely under-priced to drive up prices. A recent report by the CBC showed that the Rokham Fard, , said if selling prices were more accessible, consumers would have more insight into what they can actually afford.\u201cYou could inform the buyer that based on prior data the seller has listed the home at a lower price point, based on what other homes in the area have sold for,\u201d Fard told Global News.\u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t get mentally drained from going into all of these bidding wars.\u201dRecognizing the potential power of this data, Toronto\u2019s Spring Reality is working on a database that will predict what homes might sell for using past sales data.\u201cWhat we want to do is stop wasting people\u2019s time,\u201d said Mamourian. \u201cWe want to narrow down on the number of people with a $700,000 budget looking at properties that sell for over $800,000.\u201dBut Mamourian\u2019s team can\u2019t move forward with their project until the tribunal provides more information about what data TREB should release.Meanwhile other real estate startups are turning to crowdsourcing.Take for example RedDoor \u2013  by crowdsourcing selling data from home buyers themselves.RedDoor allows users to compare estimated property values by neighbourhood, right down to a specific street. Homeowners are encouraged to share details about their property, along with the selling price, in order to build the database. In exchange for their data, RedDoor donates to a charity that operates in their neighbourhood.The app, which launched earlier this month, already has data on over 100,000 Toronto-area homes in 44 neighbourhoods.\u201cI think people feel that because there is no way to vet real estate information, you end up putting so much trust into another person [a real estate agent] to tell you what your home is worth or what you can afford,\u201d said RedDoor cofounder Adrienne Scott.\u201cWe live in a world where we can research so much on our own \u2013 if that information is locked away by key it only makes things more difficult.\u201dScott believes that the outcome of the TREB ruling will ultimately trickle down to other major cities in the country and allow companies like hers to grow their databases outside of Toronto.Global News reached out to many real estate boards across the country,including the Realators\xa0Association of Edmonton\xa0and\xa0the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver; however, all declined to comment until more information about the ruling becomes\xa0available.In a statement to Global News, the Canadian Real Estate Association said: \u201cWhile the Tribunal partially granted the Commissioner\u2019s application against TREB, it has asked the parties to make further submissions regarding the appropriate remedy. We will not be in a position to fully assess the ramifications of the decision until the Tribunal decides the issue of remedy and issues its Order.\u201d', u'Canadian YouTubers face charges after walking on protected site at Yellowstone National ParkA group of Vancouver-based YouTubers, who run the channel \xa0is\xa0facing a firestorm of criticism and misdemeanor charges after trespassing onto a protected natural site in Yellowstone National Park.The four travel vloggers \u2013 Charles Ryker Gamble, Alexey Andriyovych Lyakh, Justis Cooper Price-Brown, and Parker Heuser \u2013 were caught on camera on May 14 straying off the trail at the national park in Wyoming and walking onto the famous Grand Prismatic Spring.The spring is one of the biggest tourist draws of the park. It is the largest hot spring in the United States and features rainbow coloured rings around its edge thanks to its unique ecosystem.However, it is strictly prohibited for tourists to leave the boardwalk surrounding the Grand Prismatic Spring \u2013 a rule clearly marked by signs throughout the park.\u201cThe individuals approached the spring and took several photos or videos of themselves with an array of cameras,\u201d read court documents .\u201cThe individuals also can be seen reaching into the spring. The nearest boardwalk is approximately 25 yards from where they are located.\u201dAccording to the court documents, three of the four  members face two criminal complaints. The fourth member has not been charged \u2013 Parker Heuser \u2013 because she\xa0was not identified through the video.On Tuesday, , noting that the group has since taken down its\xa0footage from beside the Grand Prismatic Spring.\u201cWe did not respect the protected environment we were exploring, and we want to acknowledge our wrongdoing,\u201d the post read.\u201cWe got over zealous in our enthusiasm for this wonderful place. When standing at the face of such natural wonder, we were drawn to it. In an attempt to get the perfect shot, we acted in a way that doesn\u2019t reflect our respect for the environment we were trying to capture. It was the wrong decision to make.\u201dAccording to the apology, the group plans to donate $5,000 to Yellowstone National Park. The post does not make mention of any criminal charges.Global News reached out to the  crew for additional comment, but received no response.The website, where the vloggers sell their clothing line, has since gone offline.However, this isn\u2019t the first time the group has come under fire.According to posts compiled by an Imgur user, . The post also alleged one of the members had been caught \u201cgoofing around\u201d and climbing the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, Germany.In March, the group uploaded a video to its\xa0YouTube page showing members\xa0using a wakeboard to ride the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah \u2013 another area that forbids visitors from straying off designated roads.\u201cThe environment is fragile and needs to be treated with respect. When you drive, stay on established roads,\u201d reads the tourist website for the salt flats.Outrage over the group\u2019s behaviour has even sparked a Change.org petition calling on\xa0Bud Light and Red Bull to drop sponsorship for the YouTubers.

A patent filing does not necessarily mean that Google plans to use this strange safety feature.However, there are still a number of outstanding questions regarding this safety contraption. For example, what if the car was to lose control after the collision and the person was left stuck to the hood of the car?', u'Unlock the hidden FM radio locked in smartphones, broadcasters urge providersFort McMurray\u2019s ferocious wildfire\xa0ignited a\xa0hungry need for information among the people fleeing it.People shared video on Facebook, evacuees tried to keep track of family members \xa0and officials updated residents on Twitter.In a disaster, however, mobile devices have two vulnerabilities \u2014 the ever-dwindling battery and their dependence on a complex, fragile wireless system that thousands of other people are also frantically using.Cell towers are just as vulnerable to a disaster like a wildfire as any other piece of infrastructure.But when the battery winks out, or your phone can\u2019t connect to a network, there\u2019s always radio.Perhaps surprisingly, your phone may be able to switch roles and work as a traditional FM radio \u2014 if its maker, or your wireless company, allows it. (In that case, the phone is literally a radio, not a mobile device streaming audio.)To work, the device needs headphones, to work as an antenna. You don\u2019t have to listen on the headphones \u2014 they just have to be attached.\u201cThe FM radio chip is just like a regular receiver that you have in your car, or on your home stereo,\u201d explains\xa0Barry Rooke of the\xa0National Campus and Community Radio Association.The organization is to have wireless carriers allow the capability.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s already in most Android phones, already on Blackberry phones. \xa0It\u2019s something that\u2019s just not accessible to people right now because either the telecom provider or the manufacturer hasn\u2019t enabled it for the public to use.\u201dIn radio mode, a smartphone uses very little battery power and doesn\u2019t need connectivity, Rooke explains.Radio is a traditional way for governments to with people during a disaster \u2014 radios are cheap, very common and use little electricity, and communication is instant.What phones have an FM radio chip? The makers of the app say that it works on 67 devices made by 10 manufacturers. The list includes 21 Samsung phones.Apple Iphones are sold with an FM chip that isn\u2019t activated, says a\xa0\xa0released by the U.S. National Association of Broadcasters.\xa0(Apple did not respond to a request for comment.)Nearly all smartphones sold in the U.S. have a radio chip, but only about a quarter have one that\u2019s activated or easily activated.Apple is a \u201ctough nut to crack,\u201d says\xa0B.C. Association of Broadcasters president Kevin Gemmell.\u201cBlackberry \u2014 the chip is generally available, certain platforms of Android \u2014 the chips are widely available at this point in time. So, it\u2019s really iPhone, but iPhone is also a huge piece of the market share.\u201dFor your phone to work as a radio, it has to have an FM chip installed and your provider has to be on board.Carriers are reluctant to allow the technology because they don\u2019t want to lose the bandwith used for streaming audio, Gemmell says.\u201cIt\u2019s not that they have a hate on for radio, or for our technology, or for what we do. I think they were just trying to monetize as best they can.\u201d\u201cWe have a lot of devices that have that chip enabled. And it\u2019s the manufacturer\u2019s choice whether the functionality is available,\u201d said Telus spokesperson Luiza Staniec. \u201cSome have it enabled and some are not.\u201dTelus does offer devices that can be used as radios,\xa0Staniec says.\u201cThe decision to enable FM chips on devices lies solely with the manufacturers,\u201d Rogers spokesperson Andrew Garas said. \u201cSelect devices already have FM chips enabled, and we anticipate there will be more in the future.\u201dBell and Shaw Communications did not respond to a request for comment.The technology would have a crucial role in an emergency when \u201cyour smartphone becomes a brick,\u201d says\xa0Craig Fugate, head of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Administration.\u201cThere\u2019s this tendency to think that things that work in our everyday lives are going to work the same way in a disaster,\u201d he \xa0in a Youtube video.\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to reach any of my friends,\u201d remembers Fort McMurray evacuee Vishal Shukla, who spoke to Global News reporter Jill Croteau Thursday. \u201cThe telephone was not working. The tower fell down, or something. I think the FM radio stuff is a good and brilliant idea, and if it was in place I would have for sure used that.\u201d', u'Long awaited tidal power turbine heading to Bay of Fundy next monthThe first of two towering turbines designed by Cape Sharp Tidal to harness the immense power of the Bay of Fundy will be installed next month off the coast of Nova Scotia, an company official announced Thursday.Sarah Dawson, the community relations manager for the project, said one of the five-storey high, two-megawatt turbines built in Pictou by Aecon Atlantic Industrial Inc., will be loaded on a barge during the first week of June and travel around the province until it reaches the test site near Parrsboro.That trip will take a couple of weeks.\u201cOur project aims to deploy two two-megawatt hydro devices at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) site, just west of Parrsboro, and we\u2019re aiming to put both of those turbines in the water this year,\u201d Dawson said.The turbine, which is 16-metres in diameter and weighs 1,000 tonnes, was originally scheduled for deployment last year, but Dawson said it was delayed by weather.Cape Sharp Tidal \u2013 which is a partnership of OpenHydro and Emera \u2013 has not revealed the total cost of the project, but Dawson said the company has committed to spend 70 per cent of the overall cost in Nova Scotia.She said once connected to the power grid, the turbines will provide enough electricity for about 1,000 homes.The new turbines are a bigger and more robust version of a turbine tested by OpenHydro and Nova Scotia Power in 2009 that was heavily damaged by the Bay of Fundy\u2019s powerful currents.Meanwhile, Black Rock Tidal Power Inc., has announced that its tidal power platform will also be built by Aecon and installed at the same test site near Parrsboro in 2017.Their TRITON S40 uses 40 smaller turbines, each about four metres in diameter, and is expected to generate 2.5 megawatts.\u201cBecause the TRITON can be easily brought to the surface it allows for easy maintenance access. The use of multiple small turbines together with TRITON\u2019s maintenance approach reduces both capital and maintenance costs,\u201d said Nils Hirsch, general manager of Black Rock Tidal Power.He said a lot has been learned from the failed project in 2009, and his company\u2019s unique design has been successful under simulation tests.A total of five companies from around the world have been awarded a demonstration site at the FORCE test facility.It is considered Canada\u2019s leading research centre for tidal energy.', u'Google plans to compete with Amazon Echo with new \u2018Home\u2019 deviceMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2013  wants to play an even bigger role in managing people\u2019s daily lives, while also nudging them into an alternate reality, as the Internet company responds to competitive threats posed by Facebook, Amazon and Apple.As part of an onslaught of upcoming products, Google will implant a more personable form of artificial intelligence into an Internet-connected device called Home, which echoes the Echo, Amazon.com\u2019s trendy smart-home speaker.Meanwhile, Google will also delve deeper into the still-nascent realm of virtual reality with a system called Daydream that\u2019s meant to challenge Facebook-owned Oculus\u2019s early lead in fabricating artificial worlds.In an attempt to outshine Apple, Google is also adding features to its Android operating system, including the ability to run apps without actually installing them on a device.That feature, called Instant Apps, might have been the biggest breakthrough that Google announced Wednesday at its annual developers conference held in an amphitheatre located a few blocks from its Mountain View, California, headquarters.It\u2019s the first time that Google has held the conference in its hometown since the inaugural event in 2006. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told a crowd of more than 7,000 people that he wanted to move the conference from San Francisco back to Mountain View to underscore a \u201cpivotal moment in terms of where the company is going.\u201dInstant Apps is Google\u2019s answer to the pain of installing phone apps you know you\u2019ll use just once or twice, for shopping or booking a parking spot, for example. With this approach, the app runs on Google\u2019s servers instead of your phone. Only the parts you need are sent to your phone on an as-needed basis.There will also be a new chat service called Allo that\u2019s designed to counter Facebook\u2019s Messenger app and WhatsApp. Allo will draw upon a vast database that Google has built through its dominant Internet search engine to predict how you might want to respond to a text and automatically fetch links to video clips and other information that seem relevant to an ongoing conversation.Although the upcoming products will offer some unique features, they mostly painted a picture of a company scrambling to catch up with its rivals.Google Home, for instance, will mostly do the same things already performed by the Echo, a cylinder-like speaker that Amazon released last year. The Echo responds to voice commands to play music, read books, answer questions and manage calendars. It also turns off the lights, hails Uber rides and keeps adding new tasks as programmers build more apps for it.Not surprisingly, Google touted its Home speaker as a more intelligent and versatile device, mostly because it can tap into the same stockpile of information that makes Google\u2019s Internet search place so popular. Google also has redesigned its virtual assistant to be more conversational and intuitive. It will be the voice and brains inside Google Home.Although it is meant to be more personal than the automated voice that Google currently uses to respond to spoken requests on smartphones and computers, the company is simply calling it \u201cAssistant.\u201d That contrasts with the human names given to other virtual assistants from Amazon (Alexa), Apple (Siri) and Microsoft (Cortana).Google didn\u2019t reveal a price for the Home device, though it presumably will be competitive with the Echo, which sells for $180. Even if Home proves to be superior to the Echo, Gartner analyst Brian Blau thinks Google will be hard-pressed to surpass Amazon in the category. Amazon\u2019s leadership in e-commerce means it Echo \u201ccan always be on the front-page of Amazon\u2019s site and that is going to make it difficult for any rival to catch up,\u201d Blau said.Daydream is a new virtual reality ecosystem that will be made available to all comers, duplicating a strategy that worked well for Google after it fell behind Apple following the iPhone\u2019s debut nearly a decade ago.To get the ball rolling, Google will sell a virtual-reality headset with a wireless motion controller expected to carry the Nexus brand that the company original created as a showcase for its Android operating system for smartphones. Google didn\u2019t announce the price for the VR headset at Wednesday\u2019s conference, nor did it specify when it will hit the market. A similar headset, the Gear VR, made by Samsung and powered by Facebook\u2019s Oculus subsidiary, costs $100.Consumers will need a new smartphone to power the headset. It is going to be tethered to the \u201cN\u201d version of Android that Google plans to release later this year and requires more processing power and sensors unavailable in any phone already out.The new headset marks a major upgrade from Google\u2019s initial foray into VR in 2014, a cheap model made out of cardboard that sells for as little as $15 and is even given away in sales promotions by some companies.Google\u2019s new VR headset won\u2019t be as sophisticated as the recently released Rift from Oculus, which costs $600 and must be tethered to computers that can cost another $1,000 or so. Oculus spent several years perfecting the Rift, which features technology that looks so revolutionary that Facebook paid $2 billion to buy the startup in 2014.Google is now part of a larger holding company known as Alphabet Inc.', u'LinkedIn confirms 2012 hack exposed 117M user passwordsNEW YORK \u2014 LinkedIn said Wednesday that a 2012 breach resulted in more than 100 million of its users\u2019 passwords being compromised \u2014 vastly more than previously thought.The business social network said that it believes to be true a purported hacker\u2019s claim that 117 million user emails and passwords were stolen in the breach, up from the 6.5 million user credentials that the company originally said were compromised. Those 6.5 million passwords were reset in 2012 and the company advised the rest of its users to change their passwords too.The hacker, who goes by the name \u201cPeace,\u201d was trying to sell the passwords on the dark web for 5 bitcoin, or about $2,200, according to a Forbes reportMountain View, California-based LinkedIn Corp., which touts 400 million members in 200 countries and territories around the world, emphasized that there\u2019s no indication of a new data breach.', u'Foreign hackers spying on U.S. presidential candidates, says intelligence directorWASHINGTON \u2013 The United States sees evidence that hackers, possibly working for foreign governments, are snooping on the presidential candidates, the nation\u2019s intelligence chief said Wednesday. Government officials are working with the campaigns to tighten security as the race for the White House intensifies.The activity follows a pattern set in the last two presidential elections. Hacking was rampant in 2008, according to U.S. intelligence officials, and both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were targets of Chinese cyberattacks four years later. Despite that history, cyber experts say neither Donald Trump\u2019s nor Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign networks are secure enough to eliminate the risk.\u201cWe\u2019ve already had some indications\u201d of hacking, James Clapper, director of national intelligence, said Wednesday at a cybersecurity event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. He said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security were helping educate the campaigns.Of the attacks, Clapper predicted, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably have more.\u201dThe revelation comes after a Clapper\u2019s office released a document earlier this month saying foreign intelligence services tracked the 2008 presidential election cycle \u201clike no other.\u201d The document was part of a slide show used to warn incoming Obama administration officials that their new jobs could make them prey for foreign spies.Eight years ago, foreign intelligence services \u201cmet with campaign contacts and staff, used human source networks for policy insights, exploited technology to get otherwise sensitive data, engaged in perception management to influence policy,\u201d the document said. \u201cThis exceeded traditional lobbying and public diplomacy.\u201dJonathan Lampe with InfoSec Institute, a private information security company in Chicago, said security hasn\u2019t improved significantly since then.In October, he evaluated the security of sixteen candidates\u2019 websites and wrote a pair of 20-page reports. Using the reconnaissance skills of a casual hacker, Lampe pulled full lists of site user names and technologies used on most sites. In some cases, he discovered which directories were accessible from the Internet and which weren\u2019t. He learned what software products Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s used from a job posting soliciting a computer-wise staffer.\u201cEverybody was sitting with their pants down and by the time we looked at the sites in March, everybody had made fixes,\u201d Lampe said.But countries are probably still snooping, he said: \u201cThe sites were open enough back in October that anyone who grabbed the information then and wanted to use it, could still use it now.\u201d', u'Apple will open app development centre in India by 2017NEW DELHI \u2013  will set up an app design and development centre in southern India, the company announced Wednesday, shortly after company chief Tim Cook arrived in the country on his first visit.Tens of thousands of Indian developers design apps for Apple devices, and the company said in a statement that the development lab would give them specialized support. It\u2019s expected to open in the technology hub of Bangalore in early 2017.He said the new facility will give \u201cdevelopers access to tools which will help them create innovative apps for customers around the world.\u201dWhile the company hasn\u2019t revealed any details of Cook\u2019s schedule, local news reports say he\u2019ll meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials. He is also expected to meet top business leaders.India has one of the world\u2019s fastest growing smartphone markets but it is dominated by Android phones.Apple is also trying to get Indian government approval to sell refurbished iPhones in a market where consumers are extremely price-sensitive. There\u2019s been no official comment on that proposal but it\u2019s likely to face stiff opposition from local manufacturers.Currently Apple phones have about a 2 per cent market share in India. To make successful inroads into the Indian market the tech company will have to bring in cheaper versions of the iPhone, in a country where smartphones are available for as little as $100.Silicon Valley tech giants have been aggressively courting India over the last few years.With a massive 1.25 billion population, including 6 million new Internet users every month, India has become a key focus of companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft.', u'Your tweets are about to get longer: 140-character limit may soon exclude photos, linksThere may soon be good news for Twitter users who struggle to fit their tweets into 140-characters or less.

It said Nintendo is in talks with various film companies on a possible partnership.Wakae said an announcement will be made, but even the details of the Mariners sale have not yet been announced.Nintendo has seen its growth stagnate in recent eyes amid competition from smartphones and other devices, and films could revive interest in its franchise, which also includes .Nintendo reported a 24 billion yen ($216 million) loss for January-March, bigger than the loss it reported the previous year.

The problem, say transportation researchers, is that people will use them too much.Experts foresee robot cars chauffeuring children to school, dance class and baseball practice. The disabled and elderly will have new mobility. Commuters will be able to work, sleep, eat or watch movies on the way to the office. People may stay home more because they can send their cars to do things like pick up groceries they\u2019ve ordered online.Researchers believe the number of miles driven will skyrocket. It\u2019s less certain whether that will mean a corresponding surge in traffic congestion, but it\u2019s a clear possibility.Gary Silberg, an auto industry expert at accounting firm KPMG, compares it to the introduction of smartphones. \u201cIt will be indispensable to your life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be all sorts of things we can\u2019t even think of today.\u201dCars that can drive themselves under limited conditions are expected to be available within five to 10 years. Versions able to navigate under most conditions may take 10 to 20 years.Based on focus groups in Atlanta, Denver and Chicago, KPMG predicts autonomous \u201cmobility-on-demand\u201d services \u2014 think Uber and Lyft without a driver \u2014 will result in double-digit increases in travel by people in two age groups: those over 65, and those 16 to 24.Vehicles traveled a record 3.1 trillion miles in the U.S. last year. Increased trips in autonomous cars by those two age groups would boost miles traveled by an additional 2 trillion miles annually by 2050, KPMG calculated. If self-driving cars without passengers start running errands, the increase could be double that.And if people in their middle years, when driving is at its peak, also increase their travel, that yearly total could reach 8 trillion miles. \u201cThis could be massive,\u201d Silberg said.Driverless cars are expected to make travel both safer and cheaper. With human error responsible for 90 percent of traffic accidents, they\u2019re expected to sharply reduce accidents, driving down the cost of insurance and repairs.But the biggest cost of car travel is drivers\u2019 time, said Don MacKenzie, a University of Washington transportation researcher. That cost comes down dramatically when people can use their travel time productively on other tasks.A study by MacKenzie and other researchers published in the journal Transportation Research: Part A estimates that the vehicles can cut the cost of travel by as much as 80 percent. That in turn drives up miles traveled by 60 percent.\u201cYou are talking about a technology that promises to make travel safer, cheaper, more convenient. And when you do that, you\u2019d better expect people are going to do more of it,\u201d MacKenzie said.There\u2019s a fork ahead in this driverless road, says a report by Lauren Isaac, manager of sustainable transportation at WSP/Parsons Brinckerhoff, that envisions either utopia or a nightmare.In the best case, congestion is reduced because driverless cars and trucks are safer and can travel faster with reduced space between them. Highway lanes can be narrower because vehicles won\u2019t need as much margin for error. There will be fewer accidents to tie up traffic. But those advantages will be limited as long as driverless cars share roads with conventional cars, likely for decades.But that scenario depends on a societal shift from private vehicle ownership to commercial fleets of driverless cars that can be quickly summoned with a phone app. Driverless fleets would have to become super-efficient carpools, picking up and dropping off multiple passengers traveling in the same direction.The congestion nightmare would result if a large share of people can\u2019t be persuaded to effectively share robot cars with strangers and to continue using mass transit, Isaac said.A study last year by the International Transport Forum, a transportation policy think tank, simulated the impact on traffic in Lisbon, Portugal, if conventional cars were replaced with driverless cars that take either a single passenger at a time or several passengers together.It found that as long as half of travel is still carried out by conventional cars, total vehicle miles traveled will increase from 30 to 90 percent, suggesting that even widespread sharing of driverless cars would mean greater congestion for a long time.Airlines also may face new competition as people choose to travel by car at speeds well over 100 mph between cities a few hundred miles apart instead of flying. Transit agencies will need to rethink their services in order to stay competitive, especially because the elimination of a driver would make car-sharing services cheaper.To make the shared-vehicle model work, government would have to impose congestion pricing on highways, restrict parking in urban centers, add more high-occupancy vehicle lanes and take other measures to discourage people from traveling alone in their self-driving cars.Land-use policies may need to be adjusted to prevent sprawl, or people will move beyond the fringes of metropolitan areas for low-cost housing because they can work while commuting at high speeds. Taxes based on the number of miles a personal vehicle travels are another way to discourage car travel.All these policy changes would be controversial and difficult to achieve.While there are \u201cloads of likely positive impacts for society associated with driverless technology,\u201d people are right to worry about potential for huge increases in congestion, Issac said.\u201cWithout any government influence,\u201d she said, \u201chuman nature is to get into that single occupancy vehicle.\u201d', u'Could mobile payments lead you to overspend? How to keep your budget in checkGoing to the store armed with a wallet full of debit and credit cards may soon be a thing of the past \u2013 at least, that\u2019s what the country\u2019s biggest banks are betting on.This week, the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions announced they had signed on to make Apple Pay \u2013  \u2013 available to debit and credit card holders, marking a big step for Canada\u2019s adoption of mobile payment technology.But while banks are selling mobile payments as a convenient and fast solution for consumers, financial experts warn there could be one big risk associated with digital wallets \u2013 overspending.\u201cThe move to digital wallets is another step removed from tangibility,\u201d said Jeff Berry, senior director of research and development at LoyaltyOne.\u201cAs consumers become more and more removed from cash transactions, the amount they spend tends to rise so we can expect to see an increase in spending among those who adopt Apple Pay.\u201dIt\u2019s the same warning we\u2019ve heard over and over again when it comes to credit cards \u2013 the less we use cash, the harder it is to keep track of what we are actually spending.But some experts say we could become even more reckless with overspending once those credit cards are stored on our smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s been suggested that we reach for our wallets and purses far less often than we reach for our phones, with some data showing smartphone users reach for their devices over 100 times per day,\u201d personal finance expert Preet Banerjee told Global News.This is especially concerning considering  have hit new highs in recent times To prevent this, Banerjee said consumers need to get back to what he calls \u201cpersonal finance 101\u201d \u2013 keeping a monthly budget.\u201cGone are the days where you would have to track all your paper receipts and bills to create a good record of your expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve figured out your monthly expenses you can get a better sense of how you are spending your money and where you want to make changes.\u201dThe good news is, most mobile wallet apps allow you to see your transaction history quite easily, which means \u2013 if you are diligent \u2013 you can gain a good sense of how much is being drained from your digital wallet.Another saving grace: Apple Pay and contactless payments (tap-to-pay debit and credit cards) are limited to transactions under $100. Although this is done for security and fraud prevention reasons, it also prevents you from mindlessly tapping away on big purchases.You may be more inclined to think twice about your purchase if you have to take the time to punch in your PIN.Experts also suggest downloading a budgeting app to help keep track of your spending habits. If you do notice your day-to-day spending is out of control, Banerjee said you might be better off shutting down your digital wallet, leaving your credit cards at home, or using cash to see how much you are actually spending.While setting and sticking to a budget is your responsibility, some experts believe banks and app makers should play a part in preventing the growth of consumer debt.\u201cI am a firm believer of consumers taking responsibility for their actions; however, having said that, they still need to have mechanisms in place that if they feel they are out of control of their spending that they have help,\u201d said Jeffrey Schwartz, executive director of For example, Schwartz suggested Apple could build in a feature to Apple Pay that allows the user to set a monthly budget for the cards they store in their digital wallet.', u'Facebook pulls back the curtain on how \u2018Trending Topics\u2019 worksNEW YORK \u2013 Will \u201cTrending topics\u201d become a \u201ctrending\u201d topic on Facebook?The social media giant on Thursday , a reaction to a report in the tech blog Gizmodo that claimed Facebook downplays conservative news subjects. Facebook denies that report, which relied upon a single anonymous individual with self-described conservative leanings.In its own blog post , the company said a series of checks and balances \u2013 involving both software formulas and humans \u2013  The post linked to a 28-page internal document Facebook uses to determine trending topics, after the Guardian published a similar document that was leaked to it.Justin Osofsky, vice-president of global operations, said the guidelines ensure that stories in trending topics represent \u201cthe most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum.\u201d\u201cThe guidelines do not permit reviewers to add or suppress political perspectives,\u201d he said in a statement.Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of the social media site, took to Facebook on Thursday evening to say he plans to talk with leading conservatives in coming weeks.Facebook hasn\u2019t said how many people are responsible for the trending topics team. A Guardian report on Thursday said the team was as few as 12 people, citing leaked documents, but Facebook didn\u2019t comment on that number.Trending topics were introduced in 2014 and appear in a separate section to the right of the Facebook newsfeed. According to Facebook,  that identifies topics that have spiked in popularity on the site.Next, a team of trending topic staffers review potential topics and confirm the topic is tied to a current news event; write a topic description with information corroborated by at least three of 1,000 news outlets ; apply a category label to the topic; and check to see whether the topic is covered by most or all of ten major media outlets (including The New York Times, Fox News, BuzzFeed and others). Stories covered by those outlets gain an importance level that may make them more likely to be seen.Facebook\u2019s list of 1,000 news outlets contains several popular conservative sites, including Glenn Beck\u2019s sitetheand theEach Facebook user\u2019s trending topics are then personalized via an algorithm that relies on information about the user such as \u201cLikes\u201d and their location.', u'Google wants new emojis to represent professional womenMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2013 Google wants In a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, which controls specifications for emojis, Google says it wants to create a new set \u201cwith a goal of highlighting the diversity of women\u2019s careers and empowering girls everywhere.\u201d The proposal says women \u2013 and those under 30 in particular \u2013 are the most frequent users of emojis.Sample emojis provided by Google in the proposal show several female characters in professional clothing, including business suits, lab coats, medical scrubs and construction hats. One sample emoji even has a pitchfork and a farmer\u2019s hat. Google has also included sample male versions of the same emojis.Mountain View, California-based Google wants Unicode to standardize the emojis by the end of the year.', u'Google is banning payday loan adsNEW YORK \u2013 Internet giant Google said Wednesday , calling the industry \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201charmful.\u201dGoogle\u2019s decision could have as much or even more impact on curtailing the industry than any move by politicians, as many payday loans start with a desperate person searching online for ways to make ends meet or cover an emergency.Effective July 13, Google will no longer allow ads for loans due within 60 days and will also ban ads for loans where the interest rate is 36 per cent or higher. The industry will join Google\u2019s other banned categories of ads, such as counterfeit goods, weapons, explosives, tobacco products and hate speech.\u201cOur hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,\u201d The ban would not impact companies offering mortgages, auto loans, student loans, loans for businesses or credit cards, Google said.Payday lenders have long been a target of criticism by politicians and consumer advocates, who argue the industry charges extremely high interest rates to customers, who are often the poor. Payday loans are often used to cover an unexpected expense or to make ends meet before the next paycheque. But for many borrowers, short-term loans wind up being difficult to pay off, leading to a cycle of debt that can drag on for months.A 2012 study by Pew showed the average payday borrower is in debt for five months, spending $520 in fees and interest to repeatedly borrow $375. The annual per cent rate on a payday loan is 391 per cent, according to Pew.Payday loan stores reap billions of dollars in interest and fees on a product designed to force borrowers into repeat loans. Google is to be praised for doing its part to limit use of these abusive loans.\u201dIn response to critics, the payday lending industry has long argued it provides a necessary financial service to people in need of emergency funds.\u201cThese policies are discriminatory and a form of censorship,\u201d said Amy Cantu, a spokeswoman with the Community Financial Centers Association of America, the trade group representing payday lenders.State legislatures have long looked for ways to target payday lenders, but the payday lending industry has often found ways around new regulations. When several states capped the interest rates on payday loans, the industry pivoted into loans tied to auto titles or moved their operations onto Indian reservations.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering new regulations to further restrict the payday lending industry. The rules are expected to be released later this year.In a way, Google\u2019s announcement will likely have more of an impact than any new regulation. Google fields about two out of every three Internet search requests in the U.S. and also controls the world\u2019s largest digital advertising network. Most of Google\u2019s ads are triggered by the search requests, relying on an automated system to select a marketing pitch mostly likely to be related to what a person is searching for.Under this ban, users searching for words like \u201cloans\u201d or \u201cplaces to get money\u201d will no longer pull up ads from payday lenders in the advertising section of the search results.Payday lending advertising is a small, but lucrative, part of Google\u2019s ad revenues, which totalled $67 billion last year. Pew calculated in 2014 that ads related to payday loans can bring in $4.91 to $12.77 per click.The price that advertisers are willing to pay for marketing pitches delivered by Google usually reflects how much money they stand to make from making a sale. Search terms tied to products with low profit markets might fetch only a few cents while words that indicate a consumer is mulling an expensive purchase command much higher rates.But the amount of impact it will have on the overall payday lending industry remains to be seen.In the much larger world of radio and TV advertising, payday lenders spent $277 million on radio and TV ads between June 2012 and May 2013, which would remain unaffected. Two-thirds of the revenue and loans generated in the industry is done at brick-and-mortar shops, as opposed to online payday loans, said Alex Horowitz, an expert on the payday lending industry at Pew.Google, and its parent company Alphabet, has had a history of corporate activism. The company\u2019s previous motto was \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d which was replaced with \u201cdo the right thing\u201d last year.', u'Hyperloop 1 shows off super-speed propulsion technologyLAS VEGAS \u2013 A low-profile block of aluminum zipped across a short stretch of what looked like railroad tracks Wednesday before crashing into a tuft of sand and sending a small cloud into the clear skies of the desert north of Las Vegas.The seconds-long demonstration by startup Hyperloop One marked the first public glimpse of a propulsion system that its creators hope will rocket people and cargo through tubes at the speed of sound in five years.It took place as hundreds of journalists and investors watched from grandstands about 50 yards away after being bused to the site from a swanky casino.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s going to eliminate the barriers we face every day of time and distance. It\u2019s going to change our lives,\u201d CEO Rob Lloyd said a day earlier.\xa0It\u2019s real. It\u2019s happening now.\u201dExecutives with the Los Angeles-based company said the system could whisk people the 350 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 30 minutes.They described a future where there\u2019s no such thing as a long-distance relationship, and it doesn\u2019t matter where you live because the commute to work would be so quick.They say the tubes could run underground \u2013 a safe alternative to highway crossings and inclement weather.The propulsion technology involves levitating pods that use electricity and magnets to move through a low-friction environment at more than 700 mph.The idea was first articulated in a paper by Tesla co-founder Elon Musk in 2013. Musk was busy building his electric car and rooftop solar companies at the time, and offered the idea to whoever wanted to try it out.The idea has skeptics, including professor James Moore II, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Transportation Engineering Program.\t\t\t\n\t\tHe credited Musk for the new idea on how to move objects through tubes but said backers would face myriad public policy issues before it\u2019s installed on a large scale, including questions about safety, financing and land ownership.Such roadblocks are keeping self-driving vehicles off the road decades after the idea was born, he said.\u201cI would certainly not say nothing will come of hyperloop technology,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut I doubt this specific piece of technology will have a dramatic effect on how we move people and goods in the near term.\u201dHyperloop One hopes to start moving cargo by 2019 and people by 2021. It announced Tuesday that it had completed another $80 million round of financing and was partnering with firms including GE and SNCF, the French national railway company.Hyperloop One secured land in December in North Las Vegas to test the technology in a desert industrial park and will receive $9 million in state tax breaks for its investments in the state.Company officials hope to combine the separate components later this year for a test it\u2019s calling its \u201cKitty Hawk moment\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Wright Brothers\u2019 inaugural airplane flight.', u'Mississauga bans UberX, similar ridesharing services within the cityMississauga city council has voted unanimously to ban UberX and similar ridesharing services in the city.In a 10-2 decision Wednesday, councillors voted to suspend\xa0UberX services throughout Mississauga \u2014 the\xa0company\u2019s controversial cheaper service.Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said in a statement that Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as UberX can operate under the public vehicle by-law, but need to register as brokers and provide services like every other taxi cab company in the city.If drivers continue to drive within Mississauga city limits\xa0in violation\xa0of by-laws, Crombie said they will be subject to \u201call enforcement measures under the law.\u201dBut if ridesharing services such as UberX agree to immediately cease operations in the city,\xa0a committee would\xa0be struck\xa0to\xa0develop a pilot program in September\xa0to allow them to exist under\xa0a new regulated framework.Council also said\xa0the controversial service\xa0could\xa0continue if drivers adhere to the same rules as traditional taxis.\u201cWe cannot bury our heads in the sand, but must recognize new technologies and industry trends,\u201d Crombie said in a statement.\u201cBy proposing the creation of a pilot program today for TNCs, I think we will signal that we are willing to embrace change.\u201dA spokeswoman for Uber Canada said in an emailed statement that the company is reviewing the council vote.Heath\xa0declined to\xa0comment on what the regulations\xa0would mean specifically for drivers\xa0from cities that allow UberX, such as Toronto,\xa0who enter city limits or\xa0whether the service will cease operations in Mississauga immediately.In Toronto, councillors voted 27-15 last\xa0Tuesday in favour of new rules that would allow ridesharing companies to operate within the city.The regulations allow ridesharing services to operate without cameras or flashing emergency lights, saw base fares increased from $2.50 to $3.25 and allowed taxis to adopt \u201csurge\u201d pricing for rides booked by a smartphone app.The bylaw also requires taxis, limousines and PTCs to be inspected twice a year with ridesharing services\xa0having to pay a set minimum of insurance.Toronto lost an attempt to ban Uber last year after a Superior Court judge ruled the transportation company was operating within city bylaws.', u"Do you have any old Apple products?

Durex wants a condom emoji to promote safe sexThis might sound obvious, but  believes condoms are the key to promoting safe sex \u2013 emoji condoms, that is.In an \u201copen text message\u201d to the Unicode Consortium \u2013  \u2013 the condom company said it believes giving smartphone users the option to send emoji condoms could help encourage conversations about safe sex.\u201cIt\u2019s clear to see we need one \u2013 it\u2019s not rocket science. Emojis have changed how we talk about the birds and the bees,\u201d reads a plain-English translation of the company\u2019s message. The original version was written mostly in emojis.Durex claims the condom \u2013 arguably the biggest symbol for promoting safe sex \u2013 will encourage smartphone users to talk about safe sex with their partners, adding that the discussion of safe sex is vital to preventing sexually transmitted diseases and infections, including HIV and AIDS.There is no doubt that emojis have become a new part of communication since their rise to popularity in 2011. when it picked an emoji \u2013 the \u201cFace with Tears of Joy\u201d emoji to be exact \u2013 as its 2015 \u201cword\u201d of the year, prompting linguistic experts from all over the world to weigh in on whether emojis had become their\xa0own language.\u201cDigital communication is the sign of our times. And emoji functions extremely well in that medium, often in language-like ways. And for this reason, it is surely not a stretch to consider an emoji to be, if not a word in the conventional sense, at the very least, having language-like properties,\u201d wrote Vyvyan Evans, professor of linguistics at Bangor University in a blog post for Oxford Dictionaries.Social media strategist Brent Stirling with Ryerson University\u2019s business incubator DMZ added, \u201cAs more and more communication and interaction between people turns digital, emojis fill the gap that text cannot. This allows people to communicate their tone, body language and facial expressions that would normally accompany an in-person conversation.\u201dOr perhaps, as Durex hopes, allow people to bring up uncomfortable topics like contraception.And while a condom emoji may inspire a bit of giggling from some users, let\u2019s not forget that campaigns like this have worked in the past.The taco emoji was a product of an online petition started by Taco Bell that garnered over 32,000 signatures by the time the new symbol was released.Emojis featuring a variety of skin tones on Apple\u2019s iOS platform were also created in response to However, whether the condom emoji could actually help promote safe sex and cut down on the transmission of STDs is unclear.', u'Bell\u2019s appeal against sharing Internet infrastructure deniedOTTAWA \u2013 The federal cabinet is supporting a CRTC decision that forces Canada\u2019s big Internet providers to share their high-speed infrastructure with smaller carriers at a wholesale cost.Bell Canada had asked the Liberal government to overrule the regulator\u2019s decision, saying it would discourage innovation.But the minister responsible for the telecom industry, Navdeep Bains, said today in a statement that middle-class and low-income families need access to affordable, high-speed Internet.He said the wholesale broadband ruling helps enable retail competition in the market.Bell had argued that the regulation could slow innovation by forcing it to stop investing in technology.Bell\u2019s appeal followed a July 2015 decision by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which ordered Canada\u2019s telecom giants to provide other Internet providers with wholesale access to their fibre optic networks.Bains said the CRTC decision balances the industry\u2019s incentive to continue to invest and consumer choice.

But now we\u2019re going to be paying much closer attention,\u201d said Kittisak, the director of academic standards office at the private university.Cheating is a marked aberration in the list of good behaviour expected of Thais. From a young age, Thais are taught to be polite, tolerant, respectful and to avoid confrontation. But educators say cheating has flourished because of an education system that makes exam scores the only criterion for assessing a student\u2019s ability and granting admission into places of higher learning.The three students caught red-handed have been blacklisted by the university and will not be allowed to take the replacement exams on May 31 and June 1.It was an elaborate scheme.Three agents posing as students photographed the question sheets with tiny cameras embedded in their eye-glasses. They left the room after the mandatory 45 minute lock-in period and transferred the pictures to a laptop manned by another person. That person transmitted the images to one or more private tutorial institutes where the three students were enrolled. Exam answers were then electronically transmitted to the smartwatches worn by the women, still in the examination room.Test supervisors were alerted after the first watch was seized during the Saturday morning session, the second was found on the same day in the afternoon session. The third watch and two glasses were seized Sunday.Kittisak said the three students purchased 100 per cent-guaranteed admittance packages from the private tutorial institutes for 800,000 baht ($23,000).Cheating is so rampant that schools have tried to find creative ways to combat it. Chulalongkorn University installed overhead cameras in some of its examination rooms, while in 2013 Kasetsart University created anti-cheating hats made from stapling two A4 paper sheets to a headband to resemble blinders worn by horses.Rangsit\u2019s president, Dr. Arthit Ourairat, posted pictures of the electronic devices on his Facebook page, getting nationwide attention from the media and the public.\u201cIf you can\u2019t take responsibility for your own life, you don\u2019t deserve to become a doctor, which is a career that has to take responsibility for others\u2019 lives,\u201d wrote Namstok Punika, a Facebook user in response to Ourairat\u2019s pictures.One student\u2019s parents met with university officials.The father said he didn\u2019t know anything about the cheating, said Kittisak. \u201cBut then how would a high school student be able to pay 800,000 baht on their own?\u201d', u'Storm chaser Reed Timmer captures stunning 360-degree video of tornadoRenowned storm chaser Reed Timmer is no stranger to facing down the swirling winds of tornadoes ripping through the fields and towns of the so-called tornado alley.But one of his latest videos lets followers take a spin around the storm cell, using 360-degree video.With a 360-degree camera mounted on his vehicle, Timmer and his crew captured jaw-dropping footage of the twister, allowing viewers to toggle the screen and view the storm from ground to sky and peer into the heart of the storm as he speeds towards it.Timmer, on his Twitter account, said it was the \u201cmost insane video of [a] tornado\u201d he had ever shot.The tornado outside of Wray was one of four twisters to touch down in Colorado\u2019s Yuma County Saturday.Fortunately only four people were reported injured in the stormy weather and there were no reports of damage.Since Saturday, the same system of storms has spawned a series of tornadoes in the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains \u2014 including a particularly destructive one that killed two people and destroyed several homes in Oklahoma late Monday afternoon.

Those who bank with BMO Financial will also be able to use Apple Pay in the coming weeks.CIBC and RBC customers will be able to use Apple Pay with their MasterCard, Visa and American Express credit cards, as well as their debit cards; however, Canadian Tire Financial will only support its credit card.\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Apple to bring a new way to pay that eliminates something many of us dislike: carrying a bulky physical wallet,\u201d said Jason Davies, Vice President of Digital Payments for MasterCard Canada.\xa0\u201cApple Pay allows consumers to pay with their iPhone \u2013 an item most of us wouldn\u2019t think to leave home without.\u201dAccording to a spokesperson with TD, Apple Pay will be available to its customers in \u201cthe coming weeks.\u201d\u201cWe have the most debit and credit card customers in Canada, and with the offer of yet another new mobile payment option, we\u2019re building on our leadership position in digital payments,\u201d said Teri Currie, group head of Canadian personal banking at TD Bank Group. (BMO) and the  (Scotiabank) will also roll out support for Apple Pay in the coming months.The move marks a significant step for Canada\u2019s adoption of mobile payments.Canadians have been waiting a long time for Apple Pay.

A\xa0verification code is also created for each transaction, based in part on unique keys on the phone.Even if hackers get that unique device code, , so fraudulent transactions would be declined.Apple also maintains it knows nothing about your transactions, which are handled directly by the credit card processors.If you lose your phone, your credit card provider could cancel that unique device code, which means you wouldn\u2019t need to replace the entire card.', u'New Brunswick launches strategy to become a world leader in cybersecurityPremier Brian Gallant says New Brunswick is the first province in the country to develop a comprehensive strategy on cybersecurity and cyber innovation.Gallant made the announcement at the University of New Brunswick where he launched CyberNB \u2013 a strategy to create jobs and revenues in the various fields of cyber technology.Cybersecurity expert Allen Dillon has been hired to head CyberNB.He says the pace of technology has outpaced security experts, and New Brunswick is well placed to be a world leader in the efforts to combat cybercrime.Dillon says there will be approximately 192,000 information and communications technology jobs in Canada by 2020 and 67,000 of them will be in cybersecurity.He says the strategy will ensure the proper education and innovation programs are in place to ensure a large portion of those jobs are located in New Brunswick.', u'Facebook denies censoring conservative contentA  official says the company has found no evidence to back up allegations that Facebook contractors suppressed stories of interest to conservatives in its \u201cTrending\u201d section.In a Facebook post published early Tuesday, , \u201cThere are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality,\u201d adding that the guidelines don\u2019t permit political perspectives to be suppressed or one viewpoint or outlet to be prioritized over another.The post is in response to , which alleged that contractors who worked on Facebook\u2019s trending topics section had purposely blocked conservative media outlets from appearing in the sidebar, which is seen by users all over the world.According to the report, the contractors blocked stories about \u201cthe right-wing CPAC gathering, Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, and other conservative topics.\u201d\u201cDepending on who was on shift, things would be blacklisted or trending,\u201d the former curator told\xa0\u201cI\u2019d come on shift and I\u2019d discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn\u2019t be trending because either the curator didn\u2019t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz.\u201d\u201cThere are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics,\u201d Stocky said.The curator also alleged that content related to the Black Lives Matter movement was forced into the trending bar, after the company faced pressure for not having a trending topic for Black Lives Matter.\xa0Stocky also denied these allegations in his Facebook\xa0post.\u201cWe looked into that charge and found that it is untrue. We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so,\u201d he wrote.\u2014 ', u'IBM teams up with 3 Canadian universities to fight cyber crimeFREDERICTON \u2013 IBM will get help from three Canadian universities as it teaches its  to tackle .Watson \u2013 IBM\u2019s question answering computer system \u2013 was originally designed to compete (and win) on the television quiz show Jeopardy, but the technology has since been used on other problem-solving projects.Now IBM is launching Watson for Cyber Security \u2013 a cloud-based version of their cognitive technology \u2013 that will be trained over the next year to examine threats of cybercrime.Caleb Barlow, vice-president of IBM Security, said it is becoming increasingly difficult for security staff to deal with the growing number of cyber threats.\u201cYour average enterprise is dealing with 200,000 incidents a day that they\u2019ve got to dig through. Human beings simply cannot look at all of that data,\u201d he said.Barlow said experts are doing a good job to examine cyber threats, but their work often ends up in various forms such as reports, blogs and presentations and in numbers too large for others to read and remember.That\u2019s where Watson comes in.Students at the eight universities, including the University of New Brunswick, University of Ottawa and the University of Waterloo, will put the information in a form the computer can understand and help train the system to use that information to examine cyber threats.\u201cThe more information that Watson has, the better reasoning it can provide and therefore in some cases the better prediction it can provide,\u201d said Ali Ghorbani, dean of the faculty of computer science at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton.The students will input about 15,000 security documents per month during the year-long project, starting this fall.\u201cOur students are getting involved in a real-world cyber security project with a global company. Not only will they increase their knowledge, but also create a relationship with IBM for future collaborations \u2013 either jobs for our students or more research and development projects with IBM,\u201d Ghorbani said.He said IBM is hoping that not only will Watson be able to provide early warnings of potential attacks, it will also do it fast.Barlow said IBM opened its entire threat intelligence database to the world a year ago, and invited people to develop applications to work with their QRadar software. That software was developed by Q1 Labs, developed in turn at the University of New Brunswick, and purchased more than four years ago by IBM.He said by getting information out to security staff around the world, cyber crime may become less lucrative for organized crime.\u201cWe start changing the dynamic for the bad guys because it\u2019s not worth investing $100,000 or more in that new attack you\u2019ve got if it\u2019s only going to be viable for a few minutes before we find it and tell the rest of the world,\u201d Barlow said.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Meet the man behind the Wood Buffalo Twitter accountFor the past week, Jordan Redshaw has been tweeting constantly for 16 hours a day. He\u2019s responsible for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo\u2019s Twitter account.\u201cIntense,\u201d he said when asked to describe the last week. \u201cThere\u2019s been some pretty harsh lows and some even-keeled times as well. It\u2019s just been overall, pretty intense. We\u2019re working pretty crazy hours. There\u2019s a lot of people who have barely slept at all up here. It\u2019s amazing to see how well this community has come together. Everybody is in it together.\u201dFor many of the tens of thousands of people forced out of their homes by a massive and unpredictable wildfire last week, the account was their primary source of information.Before the fire, the account had roughly 8,000 followers. On Monday, it\xa0had\xa0close to 28,000.\u201cWe had to look at: what is the most timely information? What way can we make sure that information reaches the most people the fastest? How can we ensure the accuracy of that information?\u201d Redshaw said that\u2019s how the municipality decided to use Twitter to keep everyone updated.He said the social medium has been used in many different ways during the wildfire emergency \u2013 during the evacuation and afterwards.\u201cIn the actual emergency, we were connecting people with RCMP\u2026\xa0If there\u2019s someone stuck in their home or didn\u2019t have transit\u2026 or [were] mobility challenged, we were ensuring they were getting connected,\u201d Redshaw said.After the city was evacuated, he was able to use the Twitter account to help those who were forced to leave with nothing.\u201cThere was a woman who was looking for diapers down in Edmonton. I just sent out a quick tweet saying, \u2018hey, can anyone help this person?\u2019 and instantly, we were flooded back with responses.\u201dAnother way the communications team has used the municipality\u2019s Twitter account is to share video messages from Fire Chief Darby Allen.\u201cWe needed to have someone speak to the people just given the circumstances,\u201d Redshaw explained. \u201cChief Allen\u2019s just \u2013 he\u2019s honestly going to kill me for this \u2013 but he\u2019s an incredible human. I\u2019ve never met a leader like him in my life. He\u2019s a truly special man.\u201dDuring the chaotic and ever-evolving situation, Redshaw and his colleague Robin\xa0Smith\xa0\u2013 both Fort McMurray residents themselves \u2013 posted the latest updates on evacuation orders, emergency procedures, evacuation centres, and damage estimates to certain neighbourhoods.Smith was part of an evacuation and had to flee to Edmonton. Redshaw remains at the\xa0emergency operations centre in Fort McMurray. From about 7:45 a.m. to after midnight every day, he handles the @RMWoodBuffalo Twitter account. But don\u2019t try to give him any credit for his work.\u201cPeople are like, \u2018you\u2019re working so hard,\u2019 but when you see the other people that are here and what they\u2019re doing \u2026 It\u2019s pretty special to be honest, to see the strength of some of the characters \xa0around us. We\u2019ve got people that are working longer days than I am, that have been doing this from Day 1\u2026 and there\u2019s a good chance that no one\u2019s ever going to know who they are.\u201cWe have so many groups of people who are working crazy days just trying to help everyone out and I think that\u2019s probably the most important thing: all the credit should be going to all those people for doing this and not me.\u201dHe can\u2019t wait for a time when all these unsung heroes can be recognized.\u201cI see the generosity, I see the care, I hear the stories,\u201d Redshaw said. \u201cOne day, when we\u2019re able to really start getting the stories out about everything that\u2019s happened here, tears are going to be shed but at the same time it\u2019s going to be tears of happiness over seeing how strong the human spirit is.\u201d', u'Sheryl Sandberg salutes single mothers in viral Facebook postMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2013 Facebook\u2019s No. 2 executive  says she never realized how hard it is to be a single parent until her husband died a year ago.In a touching , Sandberg says the odds are stacked against single moms. Many live in poverty, work two jobs or don\u2019t get paid leave to care for themselves or children if they get sick, she says.She called on leaders to rethink public and corporate policies to better support single mothers. She didn\u2019t say whether anything will change at Facebook, where she is chief operating officer.Sandberg\u2019s husband, Dave, died in a treadmill accident a year ago while on vacation in Mexico.Here are other thoughts she shared on single parenting, leave policies and her book:Sandberg says she never realized how often situations come up where she\u2019s unable to stop her son or daughter from crying. \u201cWhat would Dave do if he were here?\u201d she asks herself. Sandberg writes that she never realized how many events such as father-daughter dances there are at schools and how hard they are for children without dads.The U.S., Sandberg says, is the only developed economy in the world that does not provide workers paid maternity leave. She says we need to rethink policies to better support single mothers. The post doesn\u2019t address Facebook\u2019s own policies. Facebook does offer U.S. employees up to four months of paid parental leave. It\u2019s among several high-tech companies that offer benefits around childbirth.Sandberg concedes she\u2019s fortunate not to have the financial worries that many single moms face. She admits that in her 2013 book \u201c,\u201d she should have written more about women raising children without a partner. \u201cI will never experience and understand all of the challenges most single moms face, but I understand a lot more than I did a year ago.\u201d', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: How checking an Internet connection gave an evacuee hope for his homeA Fort McMurray resident breathed a sigh of relief when a Shaw service representative gave him a sign his home may be OK after his city was devastated by a .James Lahey called the Shaw customer service line to see if someone might be able to communicate with the modem in his home, to test if the Internet connection was still working.\u201cMaybe that would at least give me some indication of whether or not the modem was intact and, in turn, my house still standing,\u201d Lahey told Global News in a phone interview from Spruce Grove, where he\u2019s now staying with an aunt and uncle.He was one of the nearly 90,000 people who evacuated Fort McMurray and the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo Tuesday, when a wildfire grew further out-of-control and engulfed neighbourhoods in and around the city. By Friday, provincial officials said the fire affected  of land.Lahey said he saw pictures of some of the devastation in his Fort McMurray neighbourhood, Stone Creek. There was  in the area surrounding his home, but he\u2019s heard a lot of contradictory stories that did not offer any concrete proof about what he could expect for his home.So he called the Shaw service line and Mel Hendershot picked up \u2014 some 1,300 kilometres away in Winnipeg.Hendershot recounted her exchange with Lahey in a Facebook post Thursday night, saying she wouldn\u2019t soon forget \u201cthe unbearable heartbreak, yet extreme happiness\u201d for a man she never met.\u201cI was doing my job as a TSR (technical service representative) with Shaw, you called me to see if there was any possibility I could ping your internet modem for any sign of life,\u201d Hendershot wrote in .\u201cYou explained to me you have no idea what is happening at your home or what\u2019s going on, your neighbourhood was plagued by fire and most of the homes in the area were levelled. You called me for any kind of hope that your home just may be still standing\u2026\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tBy pinging the modem, she was able to determine whether or not the device was still connected and communicating with the network. Not getting a response from the modem isn\u2019t a sign a home has been destroyed, but a pingback is definitely a good sign, as both power and internet would still have to be connected in order for the device to respond.Hendershot gave it a try and got a response from the device in Lahey\u2019s home.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that moment of silence when I told you your internet modem was powered on, and fully working. I\u2019ll never forget the goosebumps I had all over my body when I heard you[r] sigh of relief,\u201d she wrote in the post addressed to \u201cJames, that guy from Fort Mac that called me today.\u201dLahey said it brought him the \u201clittle bit of hope\u201d that he needed \u2014 that the modem wasn\u2019t melted in a pile of ash and rubble. Still, he\u2019s being cautiously optimistic about the fate of his home.\u201cI know that there\u2019s still a very high possibility that there could be more fire in that area,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, as of right now I do have at least something waiting for me.\u201dLahey found out about Hendershot\u2019s Facebook note, which had been shared more than 3,000 times by Friday evening, after a friend made him aware of the post. He\u2019s grateful he got the opportunity to connect with Hendershot again and thank her one more time.\u201cI realize [service representatives] are just doing a job,\u201d he said, \u201cBut\u2026 in my case and many other cases, I\u2019m assuming, they\u2019re making a huge difference whether or not they realize just how much of an impact they have by simply doing a modem check.\u201dIn an email to Global News Friday night, Hendershot said she was just \u201chappy to help\u201d however she could.\u201cI\u2019m so proud of everyone that has come together the way that they have,\u201d she said.With so many stories of tragedy and grief, people who saw Hendershot\u2019s post were thankful to hear some apparent good news.\u201cJames is going to have a much needed good night\u2019s sleep tonight because of you.

McRee, senior manager of product marketing for HTC, who was walking me through a demo of the HTC Vive virtual reality headset.But I  having a good time: it was my first experience using a virtual reality headset and being completely immersed in a virtual world.I just needed a minute to get my footing.The  is widely considered to be one of the most advanced virtual reality systems on the consumer market because it allows users to move so freely within digital worlds. Some\xa0headsets only allow you to sit or stand in one place.The system \u2013 which consists of the headset, two base stations and two wireless controllers \u2013 allows you to stand up, walk, jump and interact with the virtual world. Your movements are tracked by the base stations and interact with the 32 dimpled sensors on the face of the headset \u2013 allowing you to move around your \u201cplay space\u201d freely.Here\u2019s the catch: the Vive\u2019s\xa0virtual reality experience comes with a big price tag \u2013 \xa0That\u2019s a big chunk of change when compared to competitive models, such as PlayStation VR which will retail for about C$549. The Facebook-backed Oculus Rift headset will cost more than\xa0$900 for Canadian consumers, but that\u2019s still a little less than the Vive.But Vive\u2019s\xa0technology, combined with impressive graphics, does create a mesmerizing experience \u2013 especially for a first-time user.I only wore the headset for about 20 minutes. In that time, I travelled to outer space, dived underwater and looked a giant whale in the eye, painted in 3D, scaled Vesper Peak in Washington and learned how to shoot a bow and arrow.Each experience was quite different \u2013 for example, while\xa0under water I simply learned how to move around within the play area. HTC Vive has a safety feature called \u201cChaperone\u201d that prevents users from walking into walls or knocking over their living room furniture. When you get close to the boundaries of the play area, a 3D \u201cfence\u201d appears around you, so you know not to go any further.The bow and arrow game presented a whole new challenge \u2013 learning to pick up items that don\u2019t actually exist. To pick up my bow I needed to use the controllers I was holding in my hand, but trying to remember what buttons to press became frustrating.As a first-time user, I was surprised to experience a sense of vertigo when standing on the edge of a virtual cliff \u2013 although I\u2019m told not everyone reacts this way (maybe I\u2019m more scared of heights than I thought I was).The strangest part for me was that I felt as if I needed to walk carefully across the mountain landscape, as to not lose my footing \u2013 forgetting, of course, that I was actually standing on nothing more than carpet.According to McRee, there are now over 180 different experiences for HTC Vive, including many games.But it\u2019s not all about gaming. Virtual reality is also presenting some unique education experiences.According to McRee, there is some cool non-gaming content coming to the Vive platform. For example, a new app called \u201cSurgical Theatre\u201d is being used by surgeons to better prepare for and visualize surgery.\u201cPhysicians can actually take 3D scans of people\u2019s brains that have diseases like cancer. They can put on the Vive headset and actually walk through the brain and see how the cancer is attached on to the brain. They actually plan their surgeries around that keen understanding that they gain to physically get up and walk through and understand the brain,\u201d he said.Virtual reality is increasingly used in the medical field for training and education purposes. For example, in April\xa0\xa0preformed the world\u2019s first virtual reality surgery, ', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Albertans flock to Airbnb to offer free accommodation for evacueesAlberta residents are turning to Airbnb to offer free accommodation to the tens of thousands of  residents who were forced to evacuate their homes as wildfire continues to ravage the area. in response to the ongoing crisis.

Such status under Chinese law might limit its use on other products.The ruling in late April allows Xintong Tiandi Technology to keep using the iPhone name, according to the Legal Daily, which is published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s legal affairs committee. The company registered the name for use on handbags, mobile phone cases and other leather goods.Phone calls to the Beijing Higher Level People\u2019s Court were not answered. In a statement, Apple said it will request a retrial and added that it has prevailed in other cases against Xintong Tiandi.China is Apple\u2019s second-biggest market after the United States, though first-quarter sales in the Greater China region fell 26 per cent from a year earlier. Apple\u2019s iTunes and iBooks services also have been suspended in China, though the company said last month it hopes to resume operation soon.Apple applied to trademark iPhone for computer- and software-related goods in 2002, according to the Legal Daily.Xintong Tiandi applied to use the name on wallets and leather goods two years before Apple\u2019s smartphones went on sale in China in 2009, it said.Apple filed suit in 2012 challenging the Chinese company\u2019s use of the name.', u'Fiat Chrysler, Google are teaming up to make self-driving minivansDETROIT \u2013 Fiat Chrysler and Google will work together to more than double the size of Google\u2019s  fleet by adding 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans.The companies announced the agreement on Tuesday, saying that Chrysler engineers would work with Google to install sensors and software so the vans can drive themselves.The added vehicles are needed as Google expands real-world testing. Google says it will own the gas-electric hybrid vans, and it\u2019s not currently licensing autonomous car technology to Fiat Chrysler or anyone else. Both companies are free to work with others as well.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.The added vehicles are needed as Google increases real-world testing in four cities including Mountain View, California; Austin, Texas; Kirkland, Washington; and the Phoenix area. Initially the vans will be tested by Google on its private test track in California, but eventually they\u2019ll make their way to public roads.It\u2019s the first time Google has worked directly with an auto company on installing self-driving sensors and computers. The 100 newly redesigned minivans would be \u201cuniquely built\u201d for Google\u2019s self-driving technology, FCA said in a statement. Both companies will have engineers at a site near Detroit to work on the vans.The agreement could give FCA an inside track to manufacturing vehicles for Google because its engineers would become experienced with what Google needs. But neither company would comment on possible future deals.Currently Google\u2019s 7-year-old autonomous car project, which is now part of the so-called X lab at Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s Mountain View-based parent company, has 21 Lexus SUVs modified to drive autonomously, plus another 33 pod-like small cars.Fiat Chrysler \u2013 which has lagged bigger, richer rivals like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. in the development of self-driving cars \u2013 will welcome the chance to test Google\u2019s technology.

She spent three weeks in a coma, and a year in the hospital recovering. The collision effected not only her, but her entire family.Melody, 22, now has permanent brain damage and has lost sight in her right eye.

CanadiansA Waterloo, Ont. company can offer a great wireless deal \u2014 a $5 phone and a plan for just under $25 a month with\xa0unlimited text and talk.The problem: they can\u2019t offer it to Canadians.In the U.S., Canadian startup  contracts with Sprint to buy chunks of the telecom giant\u2019s wireless network, which it then resells to its customers. The American customers use Sprint or available Wi-Fi, as needed.But none of the big Canadian carriers want to make a similar deal. After a CRTC decision in February, that\u2019s a choice they\u2019re free to make.\u201cThe best service is only in the U.S.,\u201d laments CEO Derek Ting. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying really hard to bring that service to Canada, but without a whole lot of success.\u201dIn Canada, Text Now can only offer a free, ad-supported phone service that needs Wi-Fi to operate.To offer wireless service, small players like Ting need a partner so he can operate as a \u2018mobile virtual network operator,\u2019 an intermediary between the customer and big telecom companies.The situation seems unlikely to change, after the CRTC ruled against a group of independent Internet providers who wanted access to the big wireless providers\u2019 networks.The Canadian Network Operators Consortium,\xa0which represented dozens of small Internet service providers including TekSavvy and Distributel, wanted access so they could offer their own wireless services using the networks of Bell, Telus and Rogers.Bell, Telus and Rogers had argued that the case for building new infrastructure would be undermined if third-party carriers could piggyback on the bigger networks without building any towers of their own.Canadians pay for\xa0some of the highest-priced wireless service in the industrialized world, a 2014 CRTC  showed.In the meantime, the ad-supported phone service is basic, but for some the price is right:\u201cThere\u2019s a huge segment of teens and tweens, who are using the service as their first cell phone service.

The hospital\u2019s IT department wiped each\xa0computer\u2019s\xa0drive in response, and no payments were made. A hospital in\xa0California  in bitcoin to restore access to its electronic medical record system.In another section\xa0of her testimony on Monday, Merchant explained that critical infrastructure organizations in Canada could include things like\xa0financial systems (banks, etc.), telecommunications companies and the\xa0energy sector.\xa0Patrick Clow, chief of Cyber Operations\xa0at CCIRC, confirmed that\xa0the number of ransomware attacks being reported to the government via CCIRC are increasing.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite prevalent in the number of incident reports we\u2019ve been receiving in the last little while.\u201dThe department \u2014\xa0which employs 43 people and coordinates\xa0prevention, mitigation,\xa0response and recovery linked to \u201ccyber events\u201d \u2014\xa0does not recommend that\xa0anyone\xa0pay a ransom to unlock their data. \xa0Ransoms are typically demanded in bitcoin, a digital payment system that is less traceable than cash.She was unable to provide precise numbers for how much money may have\xa0been handed over\xa0by Canadian entities (public or private) to liberate their data.According to Matthew Held, CEO and co-founder of IT consulting firm Manawa Networks, the Canadian government and large corporations may have an easier time defending against ransomware than the average small or medium-size business.Governments can often liberate their data themselves because they have the resources and expertise to break the encryptions, Held explained. In addition, not everyone in a government department has access to all of that department\u2019s\xa0important files, so if they click on a malicious email, only their own files are taken hostage.Government entities and big business also tend to keep better back-ups.\xa0If a ransomware attack occurs, Held\xa0said, they\xa0can simply \u201croll back\u201d to an earlier back-up version of the information.', u'Black Airbnb users speak out about \u2018widespread discrimination\u2019 on service promises its users the ability to \u201cbelong anywhere\u201d with its room-sharing service; but, according to a growing number of users, the service has a widespread racial discrimination problem that prevents some from booking accommodation at all.Last week, NPR encouraged users to use the hashtag \xa0on Twitter to report incidents of alleged discrimination from Airbnb hosts.As of Tuesday, the hashtag was still being used widely as hundreds of black users alleged they had been turned down for multiple booking requests because of the colour of their skin.While most of the reports do not include the use of racial slurs, or outright rejection due to the person\u2019s race, many users alleged their white friends had an easier time booking properties through the service.\u201cEveryone in Miami denied my messages #AirbnbWhileBlack then my friend who appears to be white sent the same requests and we finally booked,\u201d In an interview with Global News, a Toronto-area Airbnb user said she has been subject to the same type of racial discrimination while trying to book accommodation in the U.S. and even at home in Toronto.The user \u2013 who asked not to be named for privacy reasons \u2013 said she had three negative experiences using the app.\u201cI was told the dates selected were not available. This was not indicated in the host\u2019s calendar. When I pointed out his failure to change his calendar, I did not receive a response. The only time I received an approval on a booking request was from an African-American man based in Dallas,\u201d the user said.These online allegations are just the beginning. A recent Harvard study, titled  conducted an experiment to see if Airbnb hosts discriminated based on names alone.Researchers sent over 6,000 requests to real Airbnb properties in five major American cities using accounts with the exact same guest information, except for names. Ten of the accounts used \u201cdistinctively African-American names\u201d and the other 10\xa0\u201cdistinctively white names.\u201dThe report found requests from  than guests with white names.Incidents of discrimination aren\u2019t just limited to black Airbnb users \u2013 one user chimed in on the #AirbnbWhileBlack conversation, alleging she had a hard time booking a rental under her Indian name.Gay Airbnb users say they have also faced discrimination on the site.In April 2015,  The couple later discovered the listing was labelled as \u201cstraight friendly.\u201d that states \u201cfair housing laws often prohibit discrimination in the selling or renting of such housing based on race, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability.\u201dThe service also bans content that promotes discrimination of any kind.In a statement to Global News, Airbnb\u2019s head of diversity and belonging, David King, reiterated the company\u2019s stance on discrimination and said the company is taking steps to address concerns of widespread discrimination.\u201cWe welcome the opportunity to work with anyone that can help us reduce potential discrimination in the Airbnb community.\u201dAccording to a spokesperson for the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the hospitality industry falls under provincial jurisdiction \u2013 that means any complaints should be placed with the appropriate provincial human rights commission, based on where the rental property is located.Airbnb users can also flag a renter\u2019s profile, listing, or messages to report anything suspicious to Airbnb \u2013 Airbnb did not comment on whether users will be helped or refunded if they turn up at a property rental and are turned away, or feel they are treated unfairly.', u'Tesla tests \u2018bioweapon defense\u2019 filter designed to purify air that could kill you vehicles already boast a number of high-tech features like \u201cludicrous mode,\u201d which takes them from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds, and self-driving mode.But now, the luxury electric car maker is testing its ,\xa0designed to protect drivers from toxic air that, the company says, could\xa0kill them.Tesla\u2019s vehicles already feature high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters which filter air coming into the vehicle of pollen, bacteria, and pollution and \u201csystematically scrubs the air inside the cabin to eliminate any trace of these particles,\u201d according to Tesla. Bioweapon defense mode is built into that filter system.\u201cBioweapon Defense Mode is not a marketing statement, it is real,\u201d read a blog post about the post-apocalyptic sounding feature.To see if the feature could live up to such large claims, the company recently put bioweapon defense mode to the test.According to Tesla\u2019s blog,  \u2013 about 100 times more contaminated than what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies as \u201cgood.\u201dThey then closed the vehicle\u2019s doors and activated bioweapon defense mode \u2013 with people inside.\u201cIn less than two minutes, the HEPA filtration system had scrubbed the air in the Model X, bringing pollution levels from an extremely dangerous 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre, to levels so low as to be undetectable (below the noise floor) by our instruments, allowing us to remove our gas masks and breathe fresh air while sitting inside a bubble of pollution,\u201d Of course, it\u2019s unclear just how long someone would be able to survive inside the car with this system in the event of an actual bioweapon attack; however, there are primary and secondary filters within the system, according to Tesla.It\u2019s also unclear whether something as sophisticated as anthrax could be filtered through the system.But although Tesla\u2019s claims that a car could save you from a military-grade bioweapon attack seem extreme, the feature could be useful to those with health conditions and anyone living in highly polluted areas, like China.', u'Cross-bearing \u2018Jesus\u2019 arrested at Apple storePHILADELPHIA \u2013 A man who calls himself \u201cPhilly Jesus\u201d has a new cross to bear: He was arrested at a Philadelphia Apple store on a trespassing charge.Philly Jesus\u2019 real name is Michael Grant.

He also tweeted that Nepal Immigration said they planned to hold him overnight.According to his Twitter profile, Penner works as a scientist at Cloud Factory, a technology company with an office in Lalitpur.An official at the Department of Immigration said Penner had a valid work visa and has been living and working in Nepal for the past couple of years', u'Why everyone wants to know if Craig Wright really invented BitcoinLOS ANGELES \u2013 The mystery creator of the digital currency bitcoin has finally stepped forward. Or has he?Australian inventor Craig Steven Wright announced Monday that  the elusive, pseudonymous bitcoin founder.In interviews with the and a few bitcoin insiders, bolstered by a technical demonstration intended to prove that he and Nakamoto are one and the same, Wright tried to lay to rest one of the biggest mysteries in the tech world.But Wright, who first emerged as a leading Nakamoto contender last December , may not have closed the case.While some bitcoin experts accept  that Wright is indeed Nakamoto, others argue that his supposed proof \u2013 a series of complex mathematical operations listed in a blog post \u2013 doesn\u2019t prove anything.Bitcoin allows people a way to make payments without using banks or national currencies such as the dollar or the euro. Because bitcoin transactions are unregulated and anonymous, the currency has proved popular among libertarians, tech enthusiasts, speculators and criminals. Nakamoto, who founded the currency in 2009, dropped out of sight in 2010, but bitcoin has mostly chugged along without him.Knowing who actually founded bitcoin wouldn\u2019t have any immediate effect on the digital currency.But the founder might have standing to weigh in on a bitter technical dispute that threatens to hamper bitcoin\u2019s growth. And the real Nakamoto would be rich and able to disrupt bitcoin just by selling chunks of his holdings. Nakamoto possesses around 1 million bitcoins worth some $440 million; those coins have never been touched.Wright\u2019s announcement is the latest twist in the long search for the real Nakamoto, a pursuit that\u2019s become a cottage industry for journalists and online sleuths.In 2011,  focused speculation on cryptography researcher Michael Clear, who denied it. Newsweek fingered Japanese-American engineer Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto more than a year ago, though this Nakamoto quickly insisted in an AP interview that it was a clumsy case of mistaken identity.Gavin Andresen, an early bitcoin developer who had extensive dealings with Nakamoto before he vanished, says yes.  Andresen said Wright demonstrated that he holds the key associated with some of the earliest bitcoins created.Others are dubious, largely because Wright\u2019s public \u201cproof\u201d of his identify was totally different \u2013 and, to them, far less convincing \u2013 than his private demonstration to Andresen.\u201cTo me, he proved absolutely nothing,\u201d said , a computer science professor at Cornell University. Sirer and others said Wright\u2019s blog post mainly amounts to a little sleight of hand using publicly available data.Jerry Brito, executive director of the Washington-based cryptocurrency think-tank Coin Center, questioned why Wright provided the supposed proof only in private exchanges with Andresen and a few others.Wright claims he has come forward now because media speculation about his involvement with bitcoin has violated the privacy of his staff. He told the Economist that he wanted to \u201cset the record straight,\u201d and in the BBC report he said that he isn\u2019t seeking fame or money and just wants to be left alone.Those might not be the only reasons. Wright is being investigated by Australian tax authorities and might need money. Going public might make it easier for him to cash in Nakamoto\u2019s bitcoins.', u'Brazil has blocked WhatsApp for 72 hoursRIO DE JANEIRO \u2013 The popular messaging service  went down in Brazil on Monday as a state judge ordered it blocked nationwide for 72 hours amid a legal tussle over users\u2019 information.WhatsApp\u2019s estimated 100 million Brazilian users suddenly found they were unable to send or receive messages in the early afternoon after Marcel Maia Montalvao, a judge in the small, remote northeastern state of Sergipe, ordered the suspension.The outage marked the latest chapter in a dispute between Brazilian law enforcement and Facebook, which bought WhatsApp in 2014.In March,  in Sao Paulo and held overnight. Officials accused the company of repeatedly failing to turn over information on WhatsApp users for an investigation into drug trafficking and organized crime.At the time, a spokeswoman for federal police in Sergipe, Monica Horta, said investigators had requested content from a WhatsApp messaging group as well as other data, including geolocation. Investigators first contacted WhatsApp several months earlier but hadn\u2019t received a response, Horta said.In a statement widely cited in Brazilian media, WhatsApp said the company was disappointed by the judge\u2019s decision, saying it \u201cpunished more than 100 million Brazilians who depend on our service.\u201dThe statement also said it does not have the information that authorities are demanding in the case. WhatsApp has been rolling out a so-called end-to-end encryption system under which only the sender and recipient can access the content of messages.Brazilian authorities also clashed with Facebook in December,  over its alleged refusal to co-operate with a police inquiry.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the time said he was \u201cstunned\u201d by the \u201cextreme decision.\u201dThe website for the Sergipe state\u2019s court system was also down Monday.', u'Craig Wright says he is \u2018Satoshi Nakamoto,\u2019 creator of BitcoinLONDON \u2013 An Australian man long rumoured to be associated with the digital currency Bitcoin has publicly identified himself as its creator, a claim that would end one of the biggest mysteries in the tech world.BBC News said Monday that Craig Wright told the media outlet he is the man previously known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The computer scientist, inventor and academic said he launched the currency in 2009 with the help of others.Wright made similar claims to the Economist magazine, which said on its website it still has \u201cnagging\u201d questions about Wright\u2019s claim. He also asserted his role in a lengthy blog post.The founder\u2019s identity has been shrouded in uncertainty, and the media\u2019s inability to pinpoint the person responsible has led to a series of investigations. Last year, some reports claimed Wright was the founder and had used a false name to mask his identity.Wright told the BBC he had decided to make his identity known to stop the spread of \u201cmisinformation\u201d about Bitcoin.Wright said he believes that Bitcoin and blockchain, the technical innovation that makes the currency possible, \u201ccan change the world for the better.\u201dHe added that he would now be able to release his research and academic work to help people understand the potential of Bitcoin.Bitcoin is designed for secure financial transactions that require no central authority \u2013 no banks, no government regulators. That makes it attractive to off-the-grid types such as libertarians, people who want to evade tax authorities, and criminals, even though Bitcoin doesn\u2019t guarantee anonymity, since it documents every transaction in a public forum.According to the BBC, Wright supported his claim to being the founder by signing digital messages using cryptographic keys used during the early days of Bitcoin.If Wright is the founder, he is likely a very wealthy person. The person going by the pseudonym Nakamoto is believed to have amassed about 1 million Bitcoins, which would be worth about $450 million if converted to cash, the BBC says.Jon Matonis, one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, which says it helps support the use of the currency, told the BBC he is convinced that Wright is who he claims to be and is responsible for a brilliant achievement.The hunt for Bitcoin\u2019s founder had become a mission for some journalists. Attention focused for a time on a Finnish sociologist, a Japanese math whiz and a Japanese-American engineer.In December, the technology magazine Wired and the website Gizmodo both published lengthy investigations based on documents and emails that concluded Wright was probably the man behind the pseudonym. He was living in an upscale suburb of Sydney at the time.The reports were circumstantial and contained no proof. But Wright\u2019s new statements, and his use of Nakamoto\u2019s own encrypted signature, known as a PGP key, may have confirmed his role.He also spoke to GQ magazine and the London Review of Books.', u'Can technology really make guns safer?Daytona Beach, Florida-based  a firearm that uses a ring with a chip in it to send a signal to a circuit board embedded in the firearm so that only an authorized user can fire the gun.But this isn\u2019t the only technology that exists or is being developed.A look at other efforts to build a \u201csmart gun\u201d and earlier efforts at making firearms safer:Armatix GmbH of Unterfoehring, Germany, has developed a handgun that uses a watch that sends signals to the handgun. The iP1 is a .22-calibre pistol that carries a 10-round magazine. The accompanying watch must be within 10 inches of the handgun for it to fire.At least two gun dealers in the United States made it available to customers in 2014 \u2013 one in California, another in Maryland. Both ceased soon after, amid an outcry among gun-rights advocates. One concern is a New Jersey law that mandates that within three years of a smart gun being commercially available, only those types of guns could be bought and sold in the state.The cost also is considerably more than a standard handgun, which can generally run around $450. Instead, the iP1 costs more than $1,300 and the buyer also has to purchase the watch separately for an additional several hundred dollars.Among those exploring the use of biometrics \u2013 similar to what is used to unlock some iPhones \u2013 is a teenager from Colorado. Kai Kloepfer received a grant from the Smart Tech Challenges Foundation to develop the technology, which would fire the handgun only when it recognized a finger placed on the grip.Kloepfer was partly inspired by the shooting at a theatre in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, which is about an hour from his home in Boulder. He has since founded Aegen Technologies, a startup company devoted to developing firearms using biometrics and other smart-gun technologies.He will be attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this fall after taking a year off after high school to spend more time developing his technology.Efforts to make guns safer with technology are not new.Many firearms include \u201ctrigger guards,\u201d the casing that loops under the trigger, and a \u201csafety\u201d switch that, when engaged, prevents the gun from firing, for example.In the 1880s, Smith & Wesson made a revolver it called \u201cchild-proof.\u201d It had what is known as a grip safety that must be squeezed at the same time the trigger is pulled for the gun to discharge. The company stopped making firearms with that feature in the 1940s.Other companies still use a grip safety, including the iGun Technology shotgun that also includes a programmable ring that sends a signal to the firearm to discharge. Springfield Armory produces a line of handguns with a grip safety, including the XD Compact model. It was involved in an accidental shooting in March. Authorities said a 4-year-old boy in Florida was in the back seat when he shot his mother, who was driving, with the .45-calibre handgun.The gun lobby is wary of the smart-gun technologies and questions their reliability.In a crisis, the gun owner needs to have confidence that it\u2019s a reliable weapon of defence \u2013 that it works and works instantaneously.While the gun lobby has reservations about the reliability of the technology, it contends it is not opposed to people looking to develop a smart gun. It is concerned that if a smart gun were successfully brought to market, it would propel the government to then mandate that all firearms have that technology.\u201cWe, the industry, are not opposed to R&D and development of this technology. We\u2019re only opposed to mandates,\u201d said Larry Keane, senior vice-president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents manufacturers. \u201cNot everybody wants or needs that feature.\u201d', u'Can smart thermostats really help save money on your energy bill?Energy bills are often a sore point for many homeowners. Whether it\u2019s the middle of a sweltering summer or the dead of winter, it seems our heating and cooling costs increase year after year.But more Canadians are turning to  to make their homes more efficient and eco-friendly.According to , one of the greatest perceived benefits of living in a \u201csmarter\u201d home includes saving money and being greener. Of those who currently own a smart home gadget, 36 per cent have invested in a smart thermostat.Just like regular old thermostats, smart thermostats are responsible for controlling your home\u2019s heating and air conditioning. The difference is, smart thermostats can learn from your behaviours to automatically adjust the temperature in your home, allow you to adjust your settings remotely and show you energy consumption statistics in real time.But do smart thermostats really help save money on your energy bill?Of course, smart thermostat manufacturers flaunt energy savings as a big selling point for their devices.The  is perhaps one of the most talked about models on the market.This particular model not only learns your schedule and helps to automatically adjust the temperature in your home throughout the day, it can adjust its settings depending on changes in the weather and learn specifics about your house and its energy consumption \u2013 whether it\u2019s drafty or takes a while to warm up.According to two independent studies and one internal study, the Google-owned company claims on average the Nest Learning Thermostat  also learns about your schedule to automatically adjust its settings. The Ecobee3 also uses remote sensors throughout your home to get the temperature right and uses geo-fencing to detect when you are leaving or returning home.According to Ecobee\u2019s research, customers in the U.S.  in 2013 \u2013 its most recent research.Nest and Honeywell have savings calculators on their websites that allow you to see how much you might be able to save with the thermostats, depending on where you live, the size of your home and what type of heating you use.According to , a 500 to 1,000 square foot home in North York, Ont., that has air conditioning and gas heating could see a savings of $35 to $94 per year. for a home in the same area estimated a savings of $88 per year, based on average cooling and heating usage.However, Nest\u2019s thermostat will cost you $329 and Honeywell\u2019s choices range from about $229 to $299, depending on the model.That means you might not see a return on investment for a few years.Did you know that for every degree Celsius (1.8 F)\xa0you lower your thermostat at night or while you\u2019re away \u2013 for a minimum of eight hours \u2013 you can save up to two per cent on your heating bill?If you have a programmable thermostat already and you already follow this advice, you are likely seeing a savings on your energy bill. If so, you might not benefit from a smart thermostat as much as someone who doesn\u2019t adjust their settings.Newsham stressed that research into the effectiveness of smart thermostats is still lacking and noted that the research that has been done does not include how people were adjusting their thermostats before getting the technology. \u2013 which rates consumer products based on their energy efficiency \u2013 does not currently rate smart thermostats on their efficiency.However; according to a spokesperson from Natural Resources Canada, Energy Star is in the process of creating a new product category in order to rate the devices.But \u2013  \u2013 nearly 90 per cent of people with programmable thermostats don\u2019t program them properly or at all because of their frustrating user interfaces.If that\u2019s still true, installing a smart thermostat could come in handy for those who don\u2019t know how or forget to pre-set their temperature settings.\u201cSmart technology is enabling automatic savings,\u201d said Shuchi Roy, innovation director at Direct Energy. \u201cLife happens \u2013 but you now have temperature control at your fingerprints, encouraging those savings.\u201dRoy added that smart thermostats can also promote greener living and added savings by offering visual cues and daily goals that tell users they are reaching their energy saving goals. Think of it like a fitness tracker for your home \u2013 positive reinforcement does work.The federal government does not currently offer any incentives for homeowners who install a smart home thermostat.However, . The company will provide customers with a free Nest thermostat when they sign up for a three year \u201cComfort and Control Plan.\u201d if they install a Nest Learning Thermostat between April 15, 2016 and December 31, 2016.', u'Drones plague Canadian airports. But are promised rules the solution?The dry language of a federal aviation database can\u2019t conceal the drama of the incidents they describe.In October of 2014, the pilot of a floatplane on its way to Squamish, B.C. from Vancouver encountered a drone at 1,400 feet, \u2018barely missing his wing.\u2019Months later, another drone whizzed 10 feet from a startled pilot as he tried to land in Vancouver.Two weeks later, a drone flying over a forest fire in the B.C. interior  of 13 aircraft helping fight the fire, which spread for four hours until they could fly again.In 2014 Toronto\u2019s Pearson airport had to a runway, and in 2015 the Vancouver control tower had to two aircraft taking off, because of drones. There are several reports in Transport Canada\u2019s incident of pilots changing course to avoid drones.Drones are increasingly causing problems for traditional aviation \u2013\xa0a fact that could pose real dangers for pilots and passengers.In 2015,\xa0there were 77 complaints, mostly from pilots, to Transport Canada about the gadgets. (In 2014, there were only 28.) Four of them describe\xa0truly close calls, where drones barely missed aircraft.Air traffic controllers asked local police for help with the problem 31 times in 2015. But across the country, only five drone operators were fined.The federal government promises new regulations\xa0\u2013 like requiring training and registration for drone operators, or specific\xa0markings of the drones themselves.\xa0But it\u2019s hard to see how this problem can be regulated away.If you can\u2019t find a drone\u2019s operator, how can you penalize them? If drones were never registered, how do you enforce registration after the fact?\u201cIf there\u2019s a collision with an aircraft, it can cause substantial damage to the aircraft,\u201d warns\xa0Ed Benoza of the Air Canada Pilots Association.The worst-case scenario involves a drone being sucked into a jet engine.\u201cIf you ever look at a jet engine, the tolerance, when it spins around, is very, very little. You throw one of those blades out of sync, or [rub something]\xa0against another metal part at thousands of RPM, it comes apart quickly\u2026\xa0it\u2019s a big emergency.\u201dRegistration seems to be coming, but nobody, including the federal government, knows how many drones are actually out there.\u201cRight now we don\u2019t keep track of how many drones are sold in Canada, or are used,\u201d Transport Canada spokesperson Natasha Gauthier says. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have any way to track that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s estimated that there were about 300,000 sold at Christmas last year,\u201d says drone flying instructor Sterling Cripps. \xa0\u201cThey end up under the Christmas tree, then on Christmas Day there are 300,000 drones in the air.\u201d(About 431,000 drone owners have registered with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration since late December, after the FAA started requiring owners to register themselves and mark their drones, but it\u2019s impossible to know what the compliance rate is.)With so many drones in the air, it can be difficult to identify one that\u2019s gone rogue.Startled pilots do their best to describe a problem\xa0drone, but the results are sketchy at best. To this day, all we know about the drone that interrupted the B.C. firefighting, for example, is that it was \u201cfluorescent orange coloured from above.\u201dIn 53 cases since early 2014 where airports asked local police for help finding a rogue drone operator, there\u2019s no evidence in the data that they ever succeeded.In most cases, rogue drone operators may not have set out to cause problems.\u201cWe believe that most drone users aren\u2019t out to do malicious things,\u201d Gauthier says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack, usually, of familiarity or knowledge with the rules.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s usually young adolescent males that are flying these things,\u201d Cripps says. \u201cI see about five per cent women in my training courses, and I\u2019m up to about 1,300, 1,400 students now\u2026\xa0The demographics are young men who go to Best Buy and just buy their equipment and go flying.\u201dOne\xa0strategy for dealing with problem drones at airports involves\xa0electronics rather than rules \u2013\xa0blocking drones\u2019 radio controller frequencies in areas where they\u2019re not wanted, or programming them to be\xa0unusable near airports.

The best thing is vigilance and socialization,\u201d he says.\u201cPeople who buy these things have to be responsible.

Other videos show Tesla owners recording flaws in how the car\u2019s autopilot system reacts to changes in road markings.\t\t\t\n\t\tTesla did not respond to requests for an interview, but the company makes clear that its autopilot feature gives cars only partial autonomy in order to make the car significantly more safe than those driven by humans alone.Transport Canada hadn\u2019t tested the Tesla, but had taken other semi-autonomous vehicles out for a spin, including the Mercedes C-Class and the Infiniti Q50, the documents show.Current Canada motor vehicle safety standards don\u2019t prohibit driverless vehicles on the country\u2019s roadways.But last month\u2019s federal budget included money for Transport Canada to develop regulations around automated vehicle design.Those regulations, at least initially, would require that the vehicles are equipped with a \u201cfailsafe mechanism that can respond to situations when the driver is not available,\u201d said the briefing notes.Ontario also set out some regulations, including a requirement that an expert in autonomous vehicles be in the driver\u2019s seat and able to assume full control at a moment\u2019s notice.But vehicles such as the Tesla don\u2019t fall under the province\u2019s autonomous vehicle pilot program, which hit the road in January, because its autopilot feature is already covered under regulations that govern the use of such technologies as self-parallel parking and brake assist.Ensuring that a driver who may not have been paying attention to his or her surroundings can suddenly control a vehicle may be easier said than done, said Kirk.\u201cPeople will not be able to respond in time.\u201dFederal officials also suggest autonomous vehicles be equipped with so-called \u201cblack box\u201d data recorders, similar to devices found in larger aircraft.\xa0", u'The story of the NFL\u2019s top draft pick, and how a tweet cost him millions in just a few hoursThere are usually some surprises in the annual National Football League draft, at least from a sports perspective: for the players being drafted, their friends and families, and for fans of the 32 teams who are all hoping their team will be the one to pick football\u2019s next star player.But in Thursday\u2019s NFL Draft, the biggest surprise didn\u2019t come in the draft room.Instead, it came on social media, after a series of bizarre and incriminating posts by the draft\u2019s top prospect, Laremy Tunsil, ended up costing him millions of dollars and could lead to an investigation of his alma matter \u2013 all in a matter of a few hours.Here\u2019s how it went down. One hour until the draft begins. At 6\u20195, weighing 310 lbs, 21-year-old University of Mississippi offensive lineman Laremy Tunsil is widely considered to be the top prospect in the draft. Draft pundits predict he will go in the draft\u2019s top three picks. A video is posted to Tunsil\u2019s Twitter account showing him appearing to smoke what looks like a gas mask bong. It is deleted a few minutes later. The 2016 NFL Entry draft gets underway. With the first pick in the draft, the L.A. Rams select quarterback Jared Goff, as some had predicted. A short time later, the Philadelphia Eagles draft another quarterback, Carson Wentz, at #2. Prior to the draft, Tunsil is projected as the top pick once these quarterbacks are off the board. With the #3 pick, the San Diego Chargers selected defensive tackle Joey Bosa, and Tunsil\u2019s draft day slide commences. The first offensive tackle, Ronnie Stanley, is taken at pick #6 by the Baltimore Ravens. Tunsil continues to sit. A bizarre statement, allegedly from Tunsil\u2019s agent Jimmy Sexton, makes the rounds on social media. In it, Sexton claims Tunsil\u2019s choice of gas mask bong was intended to \u201cshield his teammates from the emissions of hazardous and potentially intoxicating fumes\u201d and lays blame for the incident on Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201crefusal to reign in open source hacking.\u201dThe post is later revealed to be a fake.\xa0The Miami Dolphins halt Tunsil\u2019s draft day slide and select him at #13 overall.\xa0 Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said the team had been aware of the video\u2019s existence well before the draft, and said it was two years old.\t\t\t\n\t\tBecause of the NFL\u2019s rookie wage scale, what pick you\u2019re drafted at plays a huge role in how much you\u2019re capable of earning in your first contract. Had Tunsil been selected #1 overall, he would have been offered a contract worth $28.65 million over four years. His current deal, as the number 13 overall pick, has him making $12.76 million over that same time span.With a single tweet, Tunsil (or whoever hacked his account) may have lost over $16 million. Tunsil tells the Associated Press that he wasn\u2019t behind the video on his Twitter account.\u201cSomebody hacked my account, man,\u201d Tunsil said. \u201cYou know I made that mistake several years ago. Somehow, somebody got in my photos and hacked my Twitter account and somebody hacked my Instagram account, so it\u2019s crazy. I can\u2019t control that, man. I can control what I control.\u201d While he was addressing the media as the newest member of the Miami Dolphins, an image was posted to Tunsil\u2019s Instagram account showing what appeared to be text conversations between him and a member of his old coaching staff at the University of Mississippi.In these conversations, Tunsil is seen asking for money to help cover his rent and pay his bills, a request the staffer seemingly grants \u2013 a violation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules governing amateur athletes, who are forbidden from being paid or compensated monetarily (beyond the parameters of a scholarship) during their university career. When asked about the Instagram post and its allegations by a reporter in his press conference, Tunsil admits they are true.\u201cI\u2019d have to say yeah,\u201d Tunsil replied when a reporter asked him about the Instagram post, prompting a panicked assistant to his agent to hastily call off the press conference. The University of Mississippi acknowledged that an investigation into the school is likely following the incriminating Instagram post \u2013 and Tunsil\u2019s acknowledgement of its veracity.The university said in a statement it is \u201caware of the reports from the NFL Draft regarding Laremy Tunsil and potential NCAA violations during his time at Ole Miss\u201d and \u201cwill aggressively investigate and fully co-operate with the NCAA and the South Eastern Conference (SEC).\u201d', u'Carl Icahn sells Apple stake, citing China worriesBillionaire investor Carl Icahn has sold his stake in Apple, citing concerns about the giant tech company\u2019s prospects in China.Apple\u2019s stock fell 9 per cent this week after it reported a sizeable drop in iPhone sales. Icahn, a longtime booster, told CNBC he still thinks Apple is a \u201cgreat company.\u201d But he said he worries about Chinese regulators, who recently blocked Apple\u2019s online services. Apple has been hoping to expand in China.Icahn last year called it a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to invest in Apple, predicting the company could be worth $1 trillion. At that point, he owned 53 million shares, valued then at $6.5 billion, nearly 1 per cent of the company. The stock has fallen 20 per cent since then, but Icahn said he still made $2 billion from selling his shares.', u'SFU professor creates water from thin airSFU professor  has created a machine that turns air into water.\u201cPeople are really struggling with water so water has become a major issue,\u201d says Bahrami, who explains the prototype took three years to create after\xa0years of research.Unlike air conditioners, which can also similarly create condensation, he explains this prototype can create water under any weather conditions.The prototype works by enhancing the humidity in the air, and it can create between 19 to 40 liters a day.He explains he built it with a goal in mind: to make drinking water more available to those who need it the most.\u201cThere is no secret that water has become a scarce commodity, especially fresh water,\u201d he adds.He says this is not only true in places like North Africa, but also in the Canadian prairies that suffer from water shortages.Bahrami says the technology is scalable, and in the future, machines can be as small as a coffee maker or as large as necessary.He explains a few large corporations have approached him about his invention, but he says his main goal is to give this technology to the people who need it the most.\u201cI personally think we need to focus more on the humanitarian and sustainable aspect of it.\u201dSo what\u2019s next? He says his next project involves solar energy to help reduce electricity consumption.', u'\u2018It\u2019s the future\u2019: Brain-powered drones race for the first time in historyImagine you could use your brain beyond telling yourself to walk forward or sideways or perhaps pick up that cup of coffee.It was a test of concentration, but a group of students at the University of Florida used their brainpower to fly drones.For what is believed to be the first mind-controlled drone race, students wearing special headsets measuring the electrical activity of their brains were able to send drones down a 10-metre course to the finish line.The students used a technology called brain-computer interface, which allows a person to use brainwaves to control a computer.Professor Juan Gilbert, chairman of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department at the University of Florida said he hopes the competition will inspire others to continue to build upon brain-controlled technology.Brain-computer interface could be used to assist paralysed patients and those using prosthetic limbs.', u'Delta deal\u2019s signed, but Bombardier still wants federal cashIf you thought Bombardier\u2019s signing a multi-billion-dollar deal with Delta Airlines let Canada\u2019s federal government off the hook, you would be incorrect.The Quebec-based aerospace manufacturer still very much wants that cash.The Quebec government, which has already given Bombardier $1 billion, wants the feds to pitch in, too.Both\xa0 and \xa0politicians argue the pressure\u2019s mounting on the federal Liberals\xa0to provide financial assistance for .\xa0announced Thursday it\u2019s\xa0ordered 75 C100 aircraft from Bombardier, with options for an additional 50.\xa0The deal is valued at US$5.6 billion.Bombardier already owes Canadians hundreds of millions of dollars.

And this financial flexibility is something\xa0that is good to\xa0have when you operate in a very complex technological environment.\u201dThat continued push for public cash will no doubt disappoint the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, which released a statement Thursday morning congratulating Bombardier\xa0on the deal.\xa0and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have both said they\u2019re considering Bombardier\u2019s request for money.Pushing for a federal cash infusion, Couillard said Thursday that\xa0aerospace is currently the most innovative sector in the Canadian economy.Couillard argues it\u2019s\xa0\u201cparadoxical\u201d that Ottawa provided billions of dollars in loans to Ontario\u2019s auto industry during the 2008 financial crisis but appears to be dragging its feet with respect to Quebec\u2019s key sector.Couillard said he\u2019s not worried about Bombardier\u2019s financial situation, noting the CSeries order book is filled until 2020. Its first commercial flight is scheduled for July in Europe. called on Ottawa to invest in the aerospace sector as a whole, including Bombardier. He argued the CSeries needs a capital base to really \u201ctake off\u201d \u2014 and that the cash should\xa0come from the federal government.Even the federal Conservatives haven\u2019t come out against government handouts to Bombardier.\u201cConservatives are thrilled that Bombardier has secured a new purchase order for the C Series jet,\u201d reads a statement attributed to innovation critic Diane Finley.\u201cConservatives have repeatedly asked the Liberal Government to disclose details about the bailout.

Rather than build the apps itself, the tech giant developed a set of software tools and templates, called \u201cCareKit,\u201d that Apple says it wanted to help developers build easy-to-use apps for patients to record symptoms, get useful information, track their progress and even send reports to a doctor. Experts say the CareKit program could help bring standards to a relatively new and unruly industry, while giving Apple a toehold in the growing health-tech market.CareKit apps hitting the Apple online store this week include One Drop for diabetics; Start for people taking anti-depression drugs; and two apps from health startup Glow, aimed at women who are pregnant or caring for newborns.Apple says larger organizations, including the University of Rochester and hospitals at the Texas Medical Center, are working on CareKit apps for people with Parkinson\u2019s disease and patients who\u2019ve undergone heart or lung operations.\u201cThese mobile tools can help people reach their health goals,\u201d said Thomas Goetz of Iodine, a startup that used CareKit in the latest version of its Start app.Along with providing information about side-effects to depression medications, the app asks patients to record their symptoms and answer standardized questions to track how they\u2019re doing. Start uses a CareKit feature that lets patients send reports to their doctors; eventually, Goetz said, doctors will be able to respond by adjusting their instructions for medication, diet or exercise.Data stored on iPhones is encrypted, and Iodine\u2019s app provides cautions to make sure patients understand they\u2019re sending sensitive information to their doctors. Goetz said his company is also developing back-end software for medical offices that will comply with federal confidentiality rules.Apple\u2019s software could help validate new apps, he said, by letting developers build on a standardized template from a well-known company whose products are used by large numbers of people.Apple says it isn\u2019t making money directly from CareKit, which grew from tools the company previously developed for researchers to create apps that collect iPhone users\u2019 data for health studies. But Apple could benefit if the apps gain wide adoption, making the iPhone an even more useful tool for millions of people with medical conditions.\u201cEven if you can\u2019t point to a revenue stream today, being the hub of an ecosystem related to health care could have great value in the future,\u201d said analyst Jeff Cribbs, who studies health technology for the Gartner research firm.Apple CEO Tim Cook has signalled he believes the iPhone and Apple smartwatch can play a bigger role in health care. But the industry is heavily regulated and Apple has not ventured into making specialized devices that would be subject to federal oversight. Instead, the company leaves it to the developers who use Apple\u2019s software to determine if an individual app meets any health regulations.', u'Facebook earnings crush estimates, as mobile ads boost revenueMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2013  posted stronger-than-expected results for its first quarter, helped by a growing number of users and higher advertising revenue, especially on mobile devices.The social media giant on Wednesday reported earnings of $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, up from $512 million, or 18 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were 77 cents per share in the latest quarter, well above the 62 cents that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting.Revenue was $5.38 billion, up from $3.54 billion. Analysts had forecast $5.26 billion.Facebook had 1.65 billion monthly users as of March 31, an increase of 15 per cent from a year earlier. Of these, 1.51 billion signed on using mobile devices at least once a month, an increase of 21 per cent.Separately, Facebook also announced that it will create a new class of non-voting stock, known as \u201cClass C capital stock,\u201d  keep tight reins on the company even as it issues more shares to compensate employees and investors.Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said that a \u201cbig part of Facebook\u2019s success is due to Mark\u2019s leadership.\u201d The proposal, which must still be approved by shareholders, is intended to keep Zuckerberg in an active leadership role at Facebook, the company said.As in previous quarters, Facebook attributed its success to its mobile advertising strength. Sandberg said that as customers have shifted to mobile, businesses have followed.Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook\u2019s shares jumped $9.82, or 9 per cent, to $118.31 in after-hours trading.

Some game fans had expected the machine might be shown at the annual E3 electronics show in Los Angeles in June.Quarterly sales fell 26 per cent on-year to 78.8 billion yen ($708 million) as overseas revenues were hurt by a stronger yen. Nintendo racked up a nearly 18 billion yen quarterly loss the previous year.The Kyoto-based company behind Pokemon and Super Mario games said Wednesday it expects to recover to a 35 billion yen ($314 million) profit for the fiscal year ending in March 2017.For the fiscal year just ended, it earned 16.5 billion yen ($148 million), down 61 per cent from the previous fiscal year.Recent sales of Nintendo\u2019s Wii U machine have lagged rivals Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation 4 console and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Xbox One, including the key year-end holiday shopping season.After years of scoffing at the threat from smartphones, Nintendo did an about face last year and entered an alliance with Japanese mobile game company DeNA Co. to develop games for mobile devices.It said its first app for smartphones called Miitomo was doing well since its release in March. The app features customizable avatars called Miis, created using a smartphone camera and then outfitted with virtual fashions.The momentum of Nintendo\u2019s 3DS hand-held game machine has dwindled amid competition from other mobile devices and a lack of hit game software for the 3DS.Nintendo said it will release a major Pokemon software game for the 3DS called \u201cPokemon Sun/Pokemon Moon\u201d globally ahead of the holidays later this year.', u'YouTube Space opens Toronto studio: How budding creators can turn YouTube into a career new Toronto-based  is undoubtedly Canadian.A ceramic moose head, a pair of snow shoes and even a vintage tabletop hockey game adorn the wall of Studio 1. In an ode to the city picked for the first Canadian YouTube collaboration space, there are two CN tower replicas that will one day make a cameo in a creator\u2019s video. Tuesday at the George Brown School of Design.The 3,500 square foot facility will act as a place for YouTube personalities, and those getting started on the platform, to collaborate and create content.The collaborative facility will be available to YouTubers at no cost. YouTubers who are just starting their channels will be able to attend events and workshops that will share tips and tricks to get the most out of YouTube.The studio will also play host to well-known Canadian YouTube personalities who already boast millions of subscribers.YouTubers with over 10,000 subscribers will have access to two\xa0studio spaces\xa0\u2013 a ready set and one set up for virtual reality and 360 degree video \u2013 and loaner production equipment including lights, microphones and rotating sets.YouTube Space Toronto is the ninth of its kind in the world \u2013 joining studios in Tokyo, Los Angeles, London, Paris, New York, Brazil, Mumbai, and Berlin \u2013 and the first in Canada.\u201cToronto itself is such a diverse fabric of creators and we really wanted to capture that. Each space really takes on the personality of the city it\u2019s located in and Toronto is just this very exciting city with a great creative history to it,\u201d said Chris D\u2019Angelo, global head of production and programming for YouTube Spaces.According to D\u2019Angelo, the goal of YouTube Spaces is to help create better storytellers and allow YouTubers to make the most out of the video-sharing platform, which garners over 25 million unique video views per month in Canada alone.Of course, by helping content creators produce better videos, YouTube will also see a return on investment.Let\u2019s not forget, Google benefits from content creators who create millions of dollars in advertising revenue. The company is also pushing for more original content as it tries to grow subscriptions to its YouTube Red service \u2013 not currently available in Canada \u2013 which allows ad-free and offline viewing.But a growing number of people have managed to turn YouTube into a full-time career \u2013 and make good money doing it.For example, in 2015 YouTube star Felix Kjellberg \u2014 aka \u201cPewDiePie\u201d \u2014 made headlines after it was revealed  and various merchandise ventures.Canada is already home to many YouTube success stories, including  (5.1 million subscribers),  (4.3 million subscribers) and  (522,000 subscribers).And for those who have always wondered how to be successful on the platform, YouTube Space Toronto may be the place to learn.\u201cWhile you may be reaching millions, [making videos] is really a personal thing \u2013 it\u2019s just you and a camera. You don\u2019t often meet a lot of other people who do it, so it\u2019s a great chance to meet people,\u201d said Becky Wright, one half of the \u201cThis would actually be the best [thing] for people just starting out, because you can actually meet people and get real time advice. When we started we didn\u2019t know anyone doing it and we just kind of had to figure it out, but this is great for anyone starting,\u201d added fellow Sorry Girl, Kelsey MacDermaid.Wright and MacDermaid made their first DIY video back in 2010 and have been creating ever since, growing their audience to just over half a million subscribers to date.When The Sorry Girls first started out, they applied to be a part of YouTube\u2019s Partner Program which allows creators to monetize their content on the platform by way of advertisements, paid subscriptions and merchandise.Within their first year, the Sorry Girls began to grow a substantial user base, allowing them to see more advertising revenue. In September 2015, the girls committed themselves to going full time with the project and making YouTube their career.So how exactly do people make a career out of making YouTube videos?Once you have gained a large enough subscriber base and your videos are racking up a good number of views, YouTubers make money through ads that run on their videos.Every monetized YouTube channel has a CPM, which stands for \u201ccost per thousand\u201d \u2013 a dollar figure that fluctuates depending on what type of ads play on your videos. For example, if you had a $2 CPM, you would make $2 for every 1,000 video views.However, YouTube takes a cut of that revenue. That means the average YouTuber with modest views won\u2019t make a living off \xa0views alone.But personalities also make money by doing brand deals \u2013  to a brand.Once they gain a big enough following, they might launch a line of merchandise, or be featured at events that fans buy tickets to see.', u'\u2018Like the whore you are\u2019: Video highlights abuse females face onlineWould you say to someone\u2019s face\xa0the things you would post\xa0about them on the Internet?Sarah Spain and Julie DiCaro are women working in the sports industry. A new video provides a jarring look at some of the feedback they receive online, with men reading to their faces online comments\xa0about them.The men reading the tweets out loud are not the ones who wrote and sent them; they\xa0were simply told\xa0they\u2019d be reading \u201cmean\u201d comments to the women\u2019s faces.The messages get dark very quickly.\u201cThis is why we don\u2019t hire any females unless we need our c**ks sucked or our food cooked,\u201d one man reads out hesitantly, appearing uncomfortable.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of C-word,\u201d another\xa0man says, as he looks through the messages.The women involved, who the messages were originally\xa0directed toward online, had read the messages before filming began.\u201cHopefully this skank Julie DiCaro is Bill Cosby\u2019s next victim, that would be classic,\u201d says one message.

As a result, Apple on Tuesday reported its first drop in quarterly revenue in 13 years \u2013 and the first-ever year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.The slide is putting more pressure on Apple and CEO Tim Cook to come up with its next big product.Cook, of course, has problems many corporate bosses would kill to have. Despite the decline in sales, Apple managed to rack up $10.5 billion in profit for the quarter.\u201cThe future of Apple is very bright,\u201d Cook told analysts on a conference call Tuesday.But Apple is battling perceptions that its latest iPhones aren\u2019t that different from previous models, at a time when overall smartphone sales are slowing around the world. Apple also sells iPads, Mac computers and other gadgets, but nearly two-thirds of its $50.6 billion in quarterly revenue came from iPhones.\u201cThey need to come out with that next great product,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a financial analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence. Zino said that while he is optimistic about the company\u2019s future,Apple hasn\u2019t reported a year-over-year sales decline since 2003, when the iPod was still relatively new and the iPhone didn\u2019t exist.Despite the decline, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri defended the iPhone business in an interview with The Associated Press.\u201cWe think we can continue to bring a lot of innovation to the market,\u201d he said of future models, but added that Apple is working to expand its other lines of business.Apple\u2019s revenue for the quarter included $6 billion from online services, apps and other software, he noted. That\u2019s up 20 per cent from a year earlier. Analysts agree the figure could rise further, given that there are more than 500 million iPhones in use.Many were hoping the Apple Watch would be the company\u2019s next big hit when it went on sale a year ago. Apple hasn\u2019t revealed sales figures for the watch, but most analysts estimate the company has sold 12 million or more, producing well over $5 billion in revenue. That\u2019s more than twice the number of iPhones sold in the first year after the product\u2019s introduction in 2007.While some owners say they\u2019re delighted with the Apple Watch, others have voiced disappointment that it doesn\u2019t do more. And critics say it hasn\u2019t ignited consumer passions in the way the iPhone became a must-have product.Apple said iPad and Mac sales both fell in the quarter. Meanwhile, the company is also widely believed to be working on other new products, such as virtual reality headsets and even electric cars.But Apple hasn\u2019t officially confirmed any plans, and Cook recently signalled that a car isn\u2019t coming soon.\u201cDo you remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting \u2013 you weren\u2019t sure what was going to be downstairs? Well, it\u2019s going to be Christmas Eve for a while,\u201d he cautioned when asked about an Apple car in February.Analysts are expecting Apple\u2019s performance to improve in the fall, when it\u2019s expected to release the next generation of iPhones with as-yet undisclosed new features.For now, Apple is finding it difficult to match the blockbuster sales it racked up last year, when shoppers flocked to buy the first iPhones with larger screens \u2013 similar to the 5- and 6-inch models that Samsung and other competitors were already selling.\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing here is those tough comparisons\u201d to last year\u2019s sales figures, Zino said. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing a lot of consumers holding onto their old phones, until the iPhone 7 launch this fall.\u201dColin Gillis, an investment analyst with BGC Financial, said smartphone sales are likely to level off rather than grow. As with PCs and tablets in recent years, he said, it\u2019s becoming more difficult for manufacturers to come up with dramatic improvements that get shoppers excited.', u'Alberta sees big spike in sexually transmitted infections, blames dating appsEDMONTON \u2013 The Alberta government says anonymous hook-ups arranged on social media are the major reason for a dramatic spike in sexually transmitted infections in the province.Cases of gonorrhea last year were up 80 per cent from 2014 and are the highest since the late 1980s.The number of cases of infectious syphilis doubled in 2015 from 2014.Dr. Karen Grimsrud, chief medical officer of health, says social media tools are helping people communicate quickly to arrange anonymous sexual encounters.\u201cNew social media tools enable people to communicate quickly to arrange anonymous sexual encounters, resulting in increased difficulty in tracking STIs,\u201d she said.Health officials say the province will step up awareness campaigns that focus on the danger of anonymous hook-ups, encourage STI testing and for people to use condoms.\u201cAHS has and will continue to step up its awareness and outreach efforts to ensure the public, especially at-risk groups, know the risks, know how to protect themselves and know the importance of getting tested for STIs,\u201d Dr. Gerry Predy, AHS Medical Officer of Health, said.\u201cThe effects of untreated STIs can extend to other sexual partners or babies of infected pregnant women. Although many STIs can be treated and cured, if left untreated they can result in serious health impacts and long-term implications.\u201dSyphilis rates have risen most notably in men who have sex with men and gonorrhea rates have increased in young indigenous females, the province said.AHS has expanded STI clinic hours in Edmonton and Calgary, increased outreach testing in Edmonton in collaboration with agencies serving those two\xa0populations, and reached out to physicians to increase STI testing for clients that are sexually active.For more information on STIs, visit .', u'Not brave enough to enter Chernobyl exclusion zone? Visit in virtual realityThirty\xa0years ago the town of Pripyat, Ukraine \u2013 about 15 kilometres outside of  \u2013 was home to roughly 45,000 people. Today it remains largely abandoned; except for the daily influx of tourists who come from all over the world to see the aftermath of the worst nuclear accident in history.All of the residents of Pripyat were forced to abandon their homes within 24 hours of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion. The area is now known as the \u201cexclusion zone,\u201d where radiation levels still remain slightly higher than normal.Yet thousands of tourists still visit the town and its eerie post-apocalyptic buildings each year \u2013 a trend often referred to as \u201ctoxic tourism.\u201dBut for those who aren\u2019t brave enough to enter the exclusion zone, or aren\u2019t able to make the journey to Ukraine, you can now visit the abandoned buildings of Pripyat in 360 degrees from the comfort of your own home.Polish virtual reality firm The Farm 51 unveiled the  Tuesday, in remembrance of the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.The virtual reality experience \u2013  \u2013 will take users on a tour of the abandoned city and offer interactive features designed to teach users about the disaster. Think of it as a virtual reality documentary.\u201cChernobyl VR Project is an edutainment application that will allow users to take a virtual trip around the disaster\u2019s site using a VR headset. The Farm 51 team plans on staying true to reality when recreating the power plant grounds and parts of the city of Pripyat,\u201d reads the company\u2019s website.In order to create the documentary, the team took footage of Pripyat\u2019s buildings and surroundings using drones, cameras and 3D scanning devices.To do so, they needed to be classified as a research team by\xa0the government and military in order to\xa0bring drones and equipment like generators, because there is no power, into the exclusion zone. Because the team was granted this access, they were also able to capture footage of areas off limits to tourists, like the Chernobyl nuclear plant itself.The final product will be released to Oculus Rift users in June. Global News contacted The Farm 51 to find out whether the team has plans to bring the experience to a more accessible virtual reality platform like Google Cardboard; however, a request for comment was not returned.According to the company\u2019s Facebook page, proceeds\xa0from each sale of \xa0the Chernobyl VR Project will be donated to organizations that help victims of the Chernobyl tragedy.\u201cIn association with the Polish-Ukrainian Open Dialog Foundation, we will select organizations to provide support to (10, 30, or 60 percent of sales profit, depending on the application version). In the meantime, please check our brand new 360-degree video released today,\u201d read the post.\u201cWe believe that Virtual Reality (VR) is not only about entertainment. It is a fast developing technology which can serve as an excellent tool also when it comes to addressing important social issues.\u201d', u'2nd security firm raises concerns about Ted Cruz, John Kasich appsWASHINGTON \u2013 Another computer-security firm raised concerns Monday about the potential for hackers to glean users\u2019 personal data from phone apps released by the campaigns of Republican presidential contenders Ted Cruz and John Kasich.An independent analysis by Symantec determined that the \u201cCruz Crew\u201d phone app could allow third parties to capture a phone\u2019s unique identifying number and other personal information. The company said the Kasich 2016 app could expose users\u2019 location data and information about other apps installed on the phones.Symantec\u2019s analysis used a test that collects unencrypted data being transmitted from phones running the campaigns\u2019 apps.READ MORE:Cruz data director Chris Wilson said Monday that Symantec\u2019s analysis was flawed and denied that the campaign\u2019s app leaks data.\u201cIf Symantec had looked more carefully, they would see that the app requests the device info but this info is never sent anywhere,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe Cruz Crew app is the most secure, popular and effective app of any 2016 presidential candidate, and our supporters are doing amazing things with it to help Senator Cruz win.\u201dThe Associated Press first reported on potential vulnerabilities with the Cruz and Kasich in March after the computer-security firm Veracode performed detailed reviews of phone apps released by presidential campaigns from both parties.Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols did not respond to messages Monday seeking comment about Symantec\u2019s report. After Veracode\u2019s analysis last month, Nichols said the security experts didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.Neither firm found suspect code in the app released by the campaign of Democrat Bernie Sanders. The campaigns of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton have not released their own apps.The AP previously reported that the Cruz Crew app is designed to gather detailed information from users\u2019 phones \u2014 potentially tracking their physical movements and harvesting the names and contact information of friends. That information and more is then fed into a vast database containing intimate details about nearly every adult in the United States to build psychological profiles that target individual voters determined to be likely Cruz supporters.The Cruz campaign has said the app\u2019s users voluntarily share their personal data, and how that information is collected and shared is detailed in legal disclosures available online.\xa0', u'Snapchat accounts re-post debauchery at universities for all to seeHALIFAX \u2013 They are images of dormitory drug use, drunken debauchery and naked selfies \u2013 captured by self-destructing photo .But social media images intended to be fleeting, and for a limited group of friends, are taking on a longer life and a much larger audience through unsanctioned accounts that collect posts from students and repost them to anyone who subscribes.The accounts raise questions about child pornography, revenge porn and invasions of privacy, because people in the background of photos and videos featured in these rogue accounts may not have consented to the post being shown to a wider audience. These accounts have cropped up at at least 26 universities and colleges across the country, according to an analysis by The Canadian Press.Students send in photos and videos to the unauthorized Snapchat account about their school. The unsanctioned account then re-posts the information for all its followers to see \u2014 without identifying the users who submitted them.That means Snapchat images and videos that were meant to automatically delete after 10 seconds are instead compiled into \u201cstories,\u201d short vignettes that can be viewed by thousands of followers within their daylong lifespan.Each story cycles through crowd-sourced clips, such as study-break selfies, keg parties, bongs, public slut-shaming and young people in various stages of undress.MacKay voiced concerns about whether all the naked subjects of these photos were of age and had consented to their distribution.\u201cThe law and policy has not kept pace with the development of technology and social media,\u201d said MacKay, who chaired Nova Scotia\u2019s cyberbullying task force.Images on Snapchat expire after 24 hours, only to be replaced by a fresh supply of photos. These accounts often feature risque content.\u201cLook how big our mouths are,\u201d one photo reads in pink letters, punctuated by a winky face. Two girls smile wide for the camera, jaws agape.\u201cWhere are the (breasts)?\u201d a user asks, and a few clips later, he had an answer.Snapchat did not respond to multiple requests for comment on how they monitor accounts for questionable content.Its community guidelines dictate that the app is not to be used \u201cfor any illegal shenanigans\u201d including pornography, nudity involving minors, invasions of privacy, threats, harassment or impersonation.\u201cSnapchat is about sharing moments and having fun,\u201d . \u201cWe will do our best to enforce (the rules) consistently and fairly, and ultimately we\u2019ll try to do what we think is best in each situation, at our discretion.\u201dSnapchat has 100 million daily users with eight billion videos viewed on the app per day. The fear of being shut down for breaking the community guidelines is omnipresent, leading proprietors of these rogue accounts to find creative ways of eluding detection, such as constantly changing usernames.\u201cThis account WILL get banned,\u201d an account featuring clips from University of Toronto students warns, suggesting followers add another account as backup for when it does.This whack-a-mole has given rise to Snapchat knock-off mobile apps that offer many of the same services as Snapchat, with even less oversight., based on their location. Submissions are anonymous, and anyone who downloads the app can see them.\u201cYour Unofficial Campus Story that WON\u2019T GET BANNED,\u201d the iTunes description reads. \u201cYou have all the power, not Snapchat.\u201dUnlike Snapchat, which is approved for children 12 and older, Mojo \u2013 College Stories recommends that its users be at least 17.The app\u2019s terms of service prohibits \u201cunauthorized activities\u201d including submissions that incite illegal activity, exploit minors or violate the legal rights of others, but the app also states that it does not necessarily police postsNeither Mojo \u2013 College Stories nor its developer, Squid\u2019s Inc., could be reached for comment.On Mojo \u2013 College Stories, The Canadian Press found channels about 26 universities and colleges, with a following of more than 25,000 total users. This could be a fraction of the true audience.The app is most popular in Halifax with nearly 6,000 users, and Dalhousie University topped the list of schools with more than 3,000 online.Universities in Winnipeg took second place, followed by Toronto.Dalhousie spokesperson Brian Leadbetter said the university contacted Snapchat to request that the institution\u2019s name be removed from the \u201cdalhousie.snap\u201d account, but he says Snapchat declined to take action. The Canadian Press contacted the owner of \u201cdalhousie.snap\u201d but did not receive a response.Leadbetter said the university has not received any complaints about the account.MacKay said that despite Snapchat\u2019s self-destructing posts feature, everyone knows a screen capture can make it permanent \u2013 and once something is on the internet, it may never disappear.Nova Scotia is drafting legislation to replace its far reaching cyberbullying law inspired by the death of Rehtaeh Parsons. The original law was passed in May 2013, weeks after the 17-year-old was taken off life-support.Parsons attempted suicide after a digital photo of what her family says was a sexual assault was circulated among students at her school.', u'Justice Department drops another iPhone hacking caseNEW YORK \u2013 The U.S. Justice Department said Friday it has withdrawn a request to  linked to a New York drug case after someone provided federal investigators with the phone\u2019s passcode.Federal prosecutors said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie that investigators were able to access the iPhone late Thursday night after using the passcode.The government said it no longer needs Apple\u2019s assistance to unlock the iPhone and is withdrawing its request for an order requiring Apple\u2019s co-operation in the drug case.The Justice Department had sought to compel the Cupertino, California-based Apple to co-operate in the drug case, even though it had recently dropped a fight to  that killed 14 people. In that case, a still-unidentified third-party came forward with a technique that managed to open the phone. That entity has not been named, and the Justice Department has not revealed the method used.Representatives for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night.The tech giant had been fighting the Justice Department\u2019s attempts and said in court papers last week the government\u2019s request was extraordinary because there is likely minimal evidentiary value of any data on the phone and that Congress never authorized it to pursue such requests through the 1789 All Writs Act. It also said there is no proof Apple\u2019s assistance was necessary and that the same technique the FBI was using to get information from the phone in California might work with the drug case phone.But prosecutors had argued that the government needed Apple\u2019s assistance to access the data, which they contended was \u201cauthorized to search by warrant.\u201dOn Thursday, several law enforcement groups filed arguments in Brooklyn federal court saying they feared the public will stop aiding police if Apple is allowed to refuse to give up information from the phone in the drug case. The groups said they supported the government\u2019s efforts to try to reverse a magistrate judge\u2019s ruling earlier this year for Apple.', u'Solar plane on around-the-world trip reaches CaliforniaSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A solar-powered airplane reached the San Francisco Bay area and performed a fly-by over the Golden Gate Bridge on Saturday afternoon following 56 hours of flight over the Pacific Ocean as part of its journey around the world.\u201cI crossed the bridge. I am officially in America,\u201d pilot Bertrand Piccard declared as he flew over the iconic span as spectators watched the narrow aircraft with extra wide wings from below.The aircraft will loiter aloft until about midnight, when winds will decrease for landing at Moffett Airfield in Mountain View. Piccard said stopping in Silicon Valley, where the airfield is located, will help link the daring project to the pioneering spirit of the area.\u201cCan you imagine crossing the Golden Gate Bridge on a solar-powered plane just like ships did in past centuries? But the plane doesn\u2019t make noise and doesn\u2019t pollute,\u201d Piccard said a live video feed on the website documenting the journey.\u201cIt\u2019s a priority to link the project we have with the pioneering spirit in Silicon Valley,\u201d he added.The aircraft started its around-the-world journey in March 2015 from Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and made stops in Oman, Myanmar, China and Japan. It\u2019s on the ninth leg of its circumnavigation.The trans-Pacific leg of his journey is the riskiest part of the solar plane\u2019s global travels because of the lack of emergency landing sites.After uncertainty about winds, the plane took off from Hawaii on Thursday morning. The crew that helped it take off was clearing out of its Hawaiian hangar and headed for the mainland for the weekend arrival.At one point passengers on a Hawaiian Air jet caught a glimpse of the Solar Impulse 2 before the airliner sped past the slow-moving aircraft.The Solar Impulse 2 landed in Hawaii in July and was forced to stay in the islands after the plane\u2019s battery system sustained heat damage on its trip from Japan.Piccard\u2019s co-pilot Andre Borschberg flew the leg from Japan to Hawaii. He was aboard a helicopter to welcome Piccard as he approached the Bay Area.The team was delayed in Asia, as well. When first attempting to fly from Nanjing, China, to Hawaii, the crew had to divert to Japan because of unfavorable weather and a damaged wing.A month later, when weather conditions were right, the plane departed from Nagoya in central Japan for Hawaii.The plane\u2019s ideal flight speed is about 45 kph, or 28 mph, though that can double during the day when the sun\u2019s rays are strongest. The carbon-fiber aircraft weighs more than 5,000 pounds, or about as much as a midsize truck.The wings of Solar Impulse 2, which stretch wider than those of a Boeing 747, are equipped with 17,000 solar cells that power propellers and charge batteries. The plane runs on stored energy at night.\xa0', u'\u2018The Internet\u2019s completely over\u2019: Prince\u2019s disdain for the web may have been a legendary musician, famous for his eclectic work and innovative musical ideas; but for someone who was praised for having such a modern take on entertainment, the artist\xa0had many apprehensions about the Internet.As fans take to the web\xa0to mourn the loss of Prince, who died Thursday at age 57, they\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find much of his music on YouTube \u2013 and for good reason. Prince\xa0was adamant about protecting his copyrights; he owned the song publishing rights to his music and vigorously pursued online outlets and users that used it without permission.In early 2014, he filed a lawsuit against 22 fans who shared unauthorized concert recordings on various websites \u2014 including dedicated Prince fan forums and Facebook.\xa0The musician sought $1 million in damages from each of the accused, for a total of $22 million. However, he ultimately .Years before,\xa0he faced off with another internet user Stephanie Lenz, who uploaded a video of her toddler bopping out to his song \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201dAccording to , only 28 people had viewed Lenz\u2019s video by the time YouTube sent her a notification that the video had been taken down due to a Universal Music Group request.For more than a decade, Prince was quite vocal about keeping his music off of services like iTunes. He complained that the services didn\u2019t\xa0pay advances for music, comparing\xa0the Internet to a passing fad like MTV.\u201cAnyway, all these computers and digital gadgets are no good. They just fill your head with numbers and that can\u2019t be good for you.\u201dEventually, some of his music was made available to some streaming services. But that ended in July 2015 when he pulled his music from all streaming sites except rapper Jay Z\u2019s platform Tidal.In a tweet sent in December 2015, Prince thanked Tidal for giving him a place where he felt comfortable releasing his music.He also stayed off social media until joining Twitter in 2013. Eventually he would start an Instagram account too. His first Instagram \u2013 posted just 26 weeks ago \u2013 shows the musician in a purple silhouette.Prince also wasn\u2019t a fan of gadgets. In a \xa0with , Prince said\xa0he can\u2019t stand digital music, nor the cacophony of ringtones it enables.\u201cHave you ever been in a room where there\u2019s 17 ringtones going off at once,\u201d he said.Further to his hatred for ringtones, the artist also claimed to stay away from smartphones. In\xa0July 2013, when asked if he used an iPhone, he told\xa0\xa0\u201cAre you serious? Hell, no.\u201dIn January, he also held a \u201csmartphone free\u201d concert in\xa0Minnesota. No phones were allowed inside the venue, ensuring no one could share pictures or videos from the show.\u2013\t\n\t', u'Snapchat honours Prince with \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 filter\u201cPurple rain, purple rain. I only wanted to see you bathing in the purple rain.\u201dSnapchat users are sharing\xa0images of themselves bathed in purple raindrops in celebration of legendary musician Prince, who died Thursday at the age of 57.The photo and video sharing app added the filter shortly after news of the musician\u2019s death broke.His publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, told the  the music icon died at his home in Chanhassen, Minn., about 32 kilometres southwest of Minneapolis. No details were immediately released. An autopsy is scheduled to take place Friday.Snapchat also featured a live story titled \u201cWe love Prince,\u201d While the \u201cPurple Rain\u201d filter was a hit with users, Snapchat is still facing controversy for its 4/20-themed Bob Marley filter that many users said looked like blackface.The filter\xa0was\xa0designed to make users look like the iconic musician \u2013 dreadlocks and all.\xa0However, it also superimposes Marley\u2019s face over the users.', u'Microsoft reports weak results despite turnaround effortSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Microsoft reported a surprise drop in sales and profit for the first three months of the year, a sign the tech giant is still trying to find its way in the post-PC era.Wall Street was expecting the company to show positive results from a series of changes that CEO Satya Nadella has been making. Instead, revenue for the January-March quarter fell 6 per cent to $20.5 billion, while profit plunged 25 per cent to $3.76 billion.Thursday\u2019s report came as other industry stalwarts reported their own struggles with seismic shifts in the way people use technology.On Monday, IBM reported its 16th consecutive quarter of revenue decline, as commercial customers abandon the once-standard model of buying programs to install on their own computers, and instead use more software online. A day later, Intel said it\u2019s cutting 12,000 jobs as fewer people buy PCs that run on Intel processors, opting instead for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.But many analysts were expecting Microsoft to do better. While sales of personal computers have been sliding for the past four years, Nadella has been working to make Microsoft less dependent on revenue from its flagship Windows operating system, used mostly on PCs.Microsoft said revenue from Windows software licenses declined 2 per cent during the quarter, after adjusting for currency fluctuations. That\u2019s better than the overall drop in PC shipments, which analysts at the Gartner research firm estimated at nearly 10 per cent.But revenue from business software and Internet-based services, known as cloud computing, didn\u2019t grow as much as analysts expected. In particular, Microsoft saw only a 3 per cent increase in revenue from its \u201cIntelligent Cloud\u201d business, where the company has invested heavily to help business customers run their operations on Microsoft\u2019s servers. The division\u2019s operating profit fell by 14 per cent.In a few bright spots, the company said sales of its Surface tablet computers rose 56 per cent to $1.1 billion, while revenue from ads shown with results from its Bing search engine grew 55 per cent to $1.5 billion. After spending billions of dollars to develop Bing as a rival for Google\u2019s highly lucrative search business, Microsoft said the service started showing a profit last fall.Some of that growth can be credited to Windows 10, which comes with a redesigned Web browser and Cortana, a Siri-like digital assistant. Both are designed to encourage more use of Bing.Microsoft says Windows 10 is now running on more than 270 million machines, a healthy figure for software that was released only nine months ago. But some of that is the result of free upgrades offered to users of older Windows versions, rather than as software sales to PC manufacturers.Under Nadella, the company has also released free versions of programs like Word and Excel for smartphones and tablets that run competing operating systems from Apple and Google. The company hopes to make money by charging users for extra features, and for related services like Skype messaging and online file storage.Microsoft is also nudging users to change how they buy software. Subscriptions to its Office 365 service are growing rapidly. And because Microsoft delivers regular updates over the Internet, analysts say that should help the company sell extra features, particularly to business users.But the turnaround is taking time to materialize. Microsoft said it earned 47 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter, or 62 cents after adjusting for one-time charges. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting adjusted earnings of 64 cents a share and revenue of $22.1 billion.Microsoft Corp. executives blamed higher-than-expected taxes for cutting into its profit for the quarter.\u201cOverall, we had a solid quarter,\u201d Nadella said during a conference call Thursday.Some analysts were inclined to accept that report. In an email, Mark Moerdler of Bernstein Research said Microsoft\u2019s earnings per share would have met Wall Street expectations if not for a \u201ctax technicality.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s stock price has been rising in recent months, as investors have generally supported Nadella\u2019s turnaround effort.

Twitter rarely gets paid directly by the brands.Examples include monitoring consumer reactions to a new product, the demographics of users or complaints about what\u2019s not in stock at a store. All that can be tracked by Tweets, Almond said.Twitter says it deals properly with people\u2019s privacy concerns, and the strength of Twitter is that the information is immediate, and all public, unlike private messages or email.\u201cThat is something we take very seriously at Twitter,\u201d Almond said of security issues. \u201cwe don\u2019t surprise the user because, if we do that, then that means that you as a user may not want to use Twitter.\u201dMaking money off online services is a challenge, and data analysis sales are one way Twitter is tackling that problem. The company, based in San Francisco, does not break down revenue for data marketing.In the U.S., for instance, a coffee retailer began to offer baristas college scholarships to retain them as employees after finding out through Twitter data that loyal companies fled after their favourite baristas quit.In Japan, tweets from regular people are getting splashed in attractive ways at huge displays at events and baseball games, using special curation technology, according to Twitter.The number of Twitter users in Japan has grown fivefold since 2011. Japanese was the first language Twitter was offered in after English, and Japanese is the most frequently used non-English language on Twitter.', u'City of Vaughan to start drone delivery pilot project may soon take to the skies north of Toronto in the City of Vaughan to deliver packages from local businesses. they are developing a drone delivery service pilot project for the area\u2019s local business network. While the drone delivery service is still merely a concept, the pilot project is believed to be the first of its kind in Canada.\u201cWe will look to develop and build, and when ready and able, implement a fleet of delivery drones within the central business district in the City of Vaughan that will deliver mail, books, and parcels, in a clean, green, environmental friendly way,\u201d said \xa0CEO of Drone Delivery Canada Tony Di Benedetto in a press release.The city will help DDC facilitate testing of its drone delivery technology through the , which provides assistance to small businesses and startups.\u201cAs an innovation and research based city we welcome this opportunity to collaborate with Drone Delivery Canada through our Test City program at the Vaughan International Commercialization Centre. We believe that this cooperation will bring about successful results,\u201d said Vaughan Mayor Maurizio Bevilacqua.According to DDC, package carrying drones could take to the skies as early as 2018, depending on government regulations.Transport Canada plans to have new rules for regulating drones by 2017.Right now Canada\u2019s rules are very different depending on whether your drone is \u201crecreational\u201d or \u201ccommercial\u201d \u2013 depending essentially on whether you\u2019re using it for fun, or to make money. Commercial drones tend to be more tightly-regulated.In 2013,\xa0Amazon announced the development of its drone delivery system called Prime Air. The company has been\xa0testing its package delivering drones in Canada over the last year.', u'Apple delays earnings report for Bill Campbell\u2019s memorialSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Apple will announce quarterly financial results one day later than planned next week, to avoid reporting on the day of a memorial service for Silicon Valley business leader Bill Campbell, a mentor to former Apple chief Steve Jobs and other tech leaders.The world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company was scheduled to report Monday on its performance for the first three months of the year.

He created SpyEye, which prosecutor Steven Grimberg said was a pre-eminent malware from 2010 to 2012 and was used to infect more than 50 million computers and cause nearly $1 billion in damage to individuals and financial institutions around the world.A second man, Hamza Bendelladj, a 27-year-old Algerian known online as \u201cBx1,\u201d will be sentenced Wednesday afternoon. Prosecutors said he sold versions of SpyEye online and used the malware to steal financial information.SpyEye was a type of Trojan virus that secretly implanted itself on victims\u2019 computers to steal sensitive information, including bank account credentials, credit card information, passwords and PIN numbers. Once it took over a computer, it allowed hackers to trick victims into surrendering personal information \u2013 including data grabbing and fake bank account pages. The information was relayed to a command and control server to be used to access victim accounts.Panin conspired with others to advertise SpyEye in online cybercrime forums and sold versions of the software for prices ranging from $500 to $10,000, FBI Special Agent Mark Ray testified.SpyEye was more user-friendly than its predecessors, functioning like \u201ca Swiss army knife of hacking\u201d and allowing users to customize it to choose specific methods of gathering personal information, Ray said. Panin is believed to have sold it to at least 150 clients.Jon Clay with IT security firm Trend Micro, which helped the FBI investigate SpyEye, said the program wasn\u2019t the most sophisticated but had good code and was reasonably priced.FBI agents in February 2011 searched and seized a SpyEye server they said Bendelladj operated in the Atlanta area. That server controlled more than 200 infected computers and contained information from many financial institutions, authorities said.In June and July 2011, covert FBI sources communicated directly with Panin, who used his online nicknames, and bought a version of SpyEye.Panin, whose real name wasn\u2019t known at the time, and Bendelladj were indicted in December 2011.Bendelladj was travelling from Malaysia to Egypt when he was arrested Jan. 5, 2013 during a layover at Bangkok\u2019s airport. Police seized laptops and external hard drives.Panin was arrested the following July, when he flew through Atlanta\u2019s airport.Ray\u2019s testimony offered a glimpse into the world of online marketplaces where cybercriminals advertise, buy and sell malicious software, using aliases to avoid arrest.Panin advertised SpyEye as early as June 2010 on Darkode.com, a cybercrime forum dismantled by the FBI last July. Before it was taken down, Darkode.com was the most sophisticated of the cybercrime forums, frequented by the cybercrime elite with access limited to those with a trusted connection, Ray said.With the cover of anonymity and payments made through online currency servers, reputation is extremely important on cybercrime forums, Ray said. After Panin\u2019s June 2010 posting as Gribodemon, Bendelladj \u2013 posting as Bx1 \u2013 wrote a comment saying he\u2019d worked with him before and vouched for him.The use of aliases can be frustrating to those who track them, said Willis McDonald, a senior threat researcher at security firm Damballa. Frequently, a cybercriminal \u201cwill disappear into the background and come up with a new alias and a new piece of malware so that trail you\u2019ve been trying to follow to track them down vanishes and they pop up under a new name and you have to start all over again trying to figure out who they are,\u201d he said.That\u2019s why disabling the infrastructure for a cybercrime network isn\u2019t nearly as effective for stopping the spread of a particular malware as catching the creator, McDonald and Clay said. Both said SpyEye infections had dwindled to negligible numbers within about a year after Panin\u2019s arrest.', u'How Chevrolet\u2019s new Malibu is using tech to keep teenage drivers safe, making the family sedan look more modern and giving it more safety and technology features, including software that helps keep teen-agers safe and parents in the know.The 2016 Malibu also ranks as the fifth-best mid-size sedan in fuel mileage in the U.S., tying the Honda Accord four-door and beating the Toyota Camry.While Consumer Reports gave the new Malibu an average reliability rating, the federal government said the 2016 Malibu earned five out of five stars in frontal and side crash tests.All this comes in a roomy car whose starting manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, including destination charge, is on the low end \u2013 just $22,500 for a five-seat model with the base, fuel-sipping engine and six-speed automatic transmission.This 1.5-litre, double overhead cam, turbocharged four-cylinder generates only 163 horsepower, which is the lowest base horsepower in a Malibu since 2008. It\u2019s also less than what most competitors offer in their base models.But the Malibu with this engine is rated by the government at 27 mpg in city driving and 37 mpg on highways.Note that the base price doesn\u2019t include the rearview camera or power-adjustable driver\u2019s seat that are standard on the base 178-horsepower 2016 Camry, which starts at $23,905. A rearview camera with moving guidelines that show where the car is headed as it backs up is also standard on the 185-horsepower 2016 Honda Accord, which has a starting retail price of $23,840.The 2016 Malibu offers a second turbo four-cylinder \u2013 a larger, 2-litre unit that generates a V-6-like 250 horsepower. Mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, this higher output four-cylinder comes with a starting price of $29,495.This was the engine in the test-driven Malibu Premier, and it did a good job of moving the 3,388-pound sedan in city and highway travel. There was especially good get up and go, as torque peaked at 258 foot-pounds at a low 1,700 rpm.This engine doesn\u2019t include the automatic stop/start system that helps save gas on the base model. And, aggressive driving of the test-driven model put the average combined city/highway mileage at 24 mpg, rather than the government\u2019s estimate of 26 mpg.More disconcerting was that the gas tank held only 13 gallons of fuel, which is far below the 17- or 18-gallon tanks that are typical of this class. So, the test-driven Malibu had to stop for gas after 300 miles, which isn\u2019t a great travel range.The Malibu drove easily, with steering that was comfortably responsive. And its 19-inch wheels and suspension provided a firm ride.Some consumers might not recognize the new Malibu. It\u2019s longer than its predecessor and has modern styling, and the back end reminds some of an Audi.The Malibu\u2019s interior is also bigger. Rear-seat legroom now measures 38.1 inches, which is an increase of 1.3 inches. This is still less than the 38.5 inches in the back seat of the Accord and the 38.9 inches in the Camry, though. The Accord\u2019s 42.5 inches of front-seat legroom also is more than the Malibu\u2019s 42 inches.The Malibu also offers more safety features now, though many, such as the forward collision alert system, are optional and will cost extra.The 2016 Malibu also is , which is software that lets parents review how a teenager drove, including the highest speed attained, distance driven and the number of times safety equipment was engaged.Teen Driver also keeps the stereo and connected devices muted until front-seat passengers buckle up.The 2016 Malibu has been the subject of three U.S. safety recalls. Two involved air bags that might deploy improperly. The third was for an intermittent defect that may not alert a driver when a seat belt is unfastened or a door is opened and the key is still in the ignition.', u"Netflix VPN crackdown: Unblock-US goes dark as Canadian users cry foulThe\xa0 has all but vanished from social media after Canadian users began reporting they were no longer able to access  while using it.Over the weekend, many Unblock-US customers took to social media to complain that they were unable to access the U.S. Netflix website, which offers a much larger catalogue of TV shows and movies than Canada\u2019s.At first, the company appeared to be responding to customer complaints on Facebook and Twitter \u2013 then their\xa0social media pages went silent about two days ago.\xa0of all its content. Its Twitter account now .Oddly, the account was interacting with users intermittently on Wednesday.What\u2019s likely happening is that Unblock-US is the latest service to be blocked by Netflix. The company has begun taking aggressive action against those using \xa0services to access content from other countries.People around the world commonly use VPN services to access Netflix content that isn\u2019t available in their market. But this violates the company\u2019s distribution deals with major studios and content providers, which are negotiated on a regional basis.In February, , stating that the company\u2019s services are against PayPal\u2019s policies because they help users get around copyright restrictions. .VPN services around the world have since been blocked by Netflix.Global News contacted Unblock-US for comment regarding whether or not Netflix has taken action against its services; the\xa0request for comment was not returned.Other VPN services are fighting back. According to a spokesperson with , the company\u2019s services still work with Netflix and they are working to ensure that doesn\u2019t change.\u201cWe are preparing and simulating a number of other workaround options in case the crackdown becomes more aggressive. We just hope the conversation shifts to address the fact that people are discouraged from securing their data online by being forced to choose between privacy and Netflix,\u201d read a statement sent to Global News.A quick search for \u201cCanadian Netflix\u201d on Twitter reveals pages of user complaints from those who appear to be growing tired of the Netflix VPN crackdown.A petition by Canadian digital rights organization Open Media,\xa0.\u201cMillions of people across Canada and the world use VPNs because they are probably the simplest, most user-friendly way to safeguard the privacy of their online activities. Given that such a huge percentage of the population uses Netflix, if they were all forced to stop using VPNs to access the shows they want, that would represent a major setback for privacy,\u201d said Open Media communications director David Christopher.\u201cIt\u2019s simply not good enough for Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to describe his pro-privacy customers as \u2018inconsequential.'\u201dIt also seems even Canadians who don\u2019t use VPN services are growing increasingly frustrated with Netflix\u2019s content catalogue.The Canadian version of Netflix currently offers around 4,000 movies and TV shows. The U.S. version offers about 7,000 for the same price. It\u2019s also known to feature more recent Hollywood blockbusters and recent seasons of popular TV shows.Netflix declined to comment on the ongoing controversy surrounding its VPN crackdown; however, the company did issue a statement to Global News regarding its ongoing promises to bring more content to Canada.The company also said it plans to add over 600 hours of original programming this year.", u'Messaging app Viber turns on end-to-end encryption for its 700 million usersMessaging app Viber has turned on end-to-end encryption\xa0for over 700 million users, as the  continues to evolve.According to a company blog post, end-to-end encryption is now available for users running the latest version of its iOS, Android, desktop and Windows 10 app.\u201cThis upgrade brings an additional layer of protection to reassure all users that Viber provides safety from third parties at the highest possible standards,\u201d End-to-end encryption\xa0means\xa0the only person who can read your messages are you and the person you send them to (and maybe the person looking over your shoulder during your commute). Simply put, your\xa0messages are scrambled into unreadable codes that requires a specific key to unscramble; only the people on each end of the conversation have the key to unscramble the messages. That includes text messages, photos, videos, voice and video calls.The move comes two weeks after messaging app giant  that use its service.While Viber has a much smaller user base than Facebook-owned WhatsApp, its announcement is significant for other reasons.Viber is owned by Japanese company Rakuten \u2013\xa0which means it will not be subject to U.S. laws.  that would effectively prohibit unbreakable encryption and require companies to help the government access data on a computer or mobile device when a warrant is issued.To use end-to-end encryption, Viber users must update their app to version 6.0 or later. .\xa0For example, a grey lock icon means\xa0\xa0the conversation is\xa0encrypted using end-to-end encryption and a green lock icon means the conversation is encrypted and both users have verified each other through an identification process.', u'Snapchat users outraged over Bob Marley \u20184/20\u2019 filter that looks like blackfaceSnapchat is facing major backlash online\xa0for its\xa04/20-themed Bob Marley filter \u2013\xa0it appears to give users blackface.4/20 \u2013 otherwise known as April 20 \u2013 marks the worldwide celebration of marijuana culture, something Marley was quite involved in.\xa0The filter, which users can apply to any of their photo or video messages, is designed to make users look like the iconic musician \u2013 dreadlocks and all.However, it also superimposes Marley\u2019s face over the users, which some users allege looks like \u201cdigital blackface.\u201dBlackface \u2013 painting your face in an apparent attempt to pretend to be African American \u2013 is widely considered racist, a relic of 19th Century American minstrelsy, in which white people blackened their faces and portrayed a dehumanized caricature of black people.Aaisha Dadi Patel, , said \u201cthe filter is a form of blackface, cultural appropriation, and totally problematic.

A Snapchat spokesperson responded with a statement that read, \u201cThe lens we launched today was created in partnership with the Bob Marley Estate, and gives people a new way to share their appreciation for Bob Marley and his music.\xa0Millions of Snapchatters have enjoyed Bob Marley\u2019s music, and we respect his life and achievements.\u201dAt time of publishing, the filter remained active within Snapchat.', u'FBI: Using third parties to break encryption not only answerWASHINGTON \u2013 The FBI is facing an increasing struggle to access readable information and evidence from digital devices because of , a senior FBI official told members of Congress at a hearing Tuesday.Amy Hess said that of the cellphones the FBI seized in the last six months as part of investigations, officials encountered passwords about 30 per cent of the time and had \u201cno capability\u201d to access information \u201caround 13 per cent of that time.\u201d\u201cWe have seen those numbers continue to increase, and clearly that presents us with a challenge,\u201d said Hess, the executive assistant director of the FBI\u2019s science and technology branch.In her testimony to a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Hess defended the Justice Department\u2019s use of a  But she said the reliance on an outside entity represented just \u201cone potential solution\u201d and that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach for recovering evidence off a locked device. She said she did not think that path should be the sole solution for breaking open phones.\u201cThese solutions are very case-by-case specific,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may not work in all instances. They\u2019re very dependent upon the fragility of the systems, the vulnerabilities we might find,\u201d she said, adding that co-operation between the government, academia and private industry was needed to come up with more solutions.Asked about the FBI\u2019s reliance on a third party to get into the phone, and its inability to access the device on its own, Hess said the work requires \u201ca lot of highly skilled specialized resources that we may not have immediately available to us.\u201dRepresentatives from local law enforcement agencies echoed Hess\u2019s concerns. Thomas Galati, chief of the intelligence bureau at the New York Police Department, said officials there have been unable to break open 67 Apple devices for investigations in 44 different violent crimes \u2013 including 10 homicide cases.Still, despite anxieties over \u201cgoing dark,\u201d a February report from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University said the situation was not as dire as law enforcement had been warning about and that investigators were not \u201cheaded to a future in which our ability to effectively surveil criminals and bad actors is impossible.\u201dThe hearing comes amid an ongoing dispute between law enforcement and Silicon Valley about how to balance consumer privacy against the desire by police and federal agents to recover communications and eavesdrop on suspected terrorists and criminals. It also comes as the Senate considers a bill that would effectively prohibit unbreakable encryption and require companies to help the government access data on a computer or mobile device when a warrant is issued.Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel who also testified, touted the importance of encryption particularly in light of devastating breaches of sensitive government information \u2013 including at the IRS and the Office of Personnel Management.\u201cThe best way that we, and the technology industry, know how to protect your information is through the use of strong encryption. Strong encryption is a good thing, it is a necessary thing. And the government agrees,\u201d Sewell testified.In response to questions raised at the hearing, Sewell said that the Chinese government had asked Apple for its source code within the last two years \u2013 and that Apple declined.The long-simmering dispute escalated in February after a judge in California directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino on Dec. 2 before dying in a shootout with police. The Justice Department last month said a third party had approached it with a way into the phone, effectively ending that court case.Another legal fight over a phone in a separate drug case is still pending in Brooklyn.', u'EU charges Google over Android antitrust battleBRUSSELS \u2013 , alleging that the technology giant rigs the global market for mobile apps by making sure its Android operating system gives preferential treatment to its own products.EU Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager  that \u201cGoogle\u2019s behaviour denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and standings in the way of innovation.\u201dVestager kicked off what is likely to be a protracted legal battle with a so-called Statement of Objections accusing  it uses its high market share in mobile operating software to force its own apps on customers.The Android operating system is designed to automatically feature Google\u2019s search engine, maps, Gmail, YouTube video service and other products that give the company more opportunities to sell digital ads. Device makers don\u2019t have to use Android as Google wants it to be, but European regulators are looking into complaints that the company penalizes those that deviate from its Google-centric design.The 28-nation EU also has other investigations against Google, with the biggest centring on its search services.As an indication how massive the latest issue is, four out of every five smartphones and tablets globally, and in the European market, use Android. Google has stormed the market since it began eight years ago to give away its Android software for free to manufacturers try to counter the runaway success of Apple\u2019s iPhone.Now, Android powers billions of mobile devices, largely because it doesn\u2019t cost phone and tablet makers anything to use the software.Google is based in Mountain View, California, and is owned by Alphabet Inc.', u'WATCH: 11 year old interview shows Mark Zuckerberg as a beer drinking college kid\u201cShould I put the beer down?\u201d is not a question you would expect to hear from Mark Zuckerberg at the beginning of an interview \u2013 but the  CEO was living quite a different lifestyle 11 years ago.A video interview from 2005 started\xa0making the rounds online Tuesday, featuring the young, beer chugging, barefoot icon discussing the future of his company \u201cthefacebook.com.\u201dAt the time, it was really only an online directory for college campuses.In the spot there\xa0is also a brief tour around Facebook\u2019s first office in Palo Alto, Calif., where employees are seen doing keg stands and a fridge appears to be stocked with nothing but beer (no joke).What\u2019s interesting about the interview is it shows Zuckerberg wasn\u2019t thinking beyond the scope of college students using\xa0Facebook.

The Internet video service isn\u2019t slowing down, either, even if it risks losing subscribers to price increases that will help pay for more exclusive shows.Since its push into original shows kicked off in earnest with the  Netflix has hit the fast-forward button.Last year, it put out 450 hours of original programming, compared to 401 from Time Warner\u2019s HBO. This year, both companies say they expect to release roughly 600 hours of original material.HBO, of course, is the network Netflix CEO Reed Hastings set out to emulate when his service began charting a course away from streaming TV reruns and previously released movies. Ted Sarandos, the company\u2019s head of programming, famously told GQ back in 2013 that Netflix\u2019s goal was \u201cto become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201dNetflix is aiming to put itself into \u201can entirely different and supreme league\u201d from its rivals, says Tom Numan, a former TV network and studio executive who now lectures at UCLA\u2019s graduate school of theatre, film and television. The company\u2019s goal, he says, is to become the first global network for original shows and movies.With Netflix now available in 190 countries, Hastings expects Netflix to surpass 100 million subscribers next year. During a review of Netflix\u2019s results on Monday, Hastings declared the company \u201creally excited\u201d about the boost it expects from its growing library of exclusive programs.Amazon.com, Hulu and other services are scrambling to catch up with their own moves into original programming. Although its own original slate is only a quarter the size of Netflix\u2019s, Amazon.com can boast that its shows won more Emmy awards last year than its rival.Netflix is counting on a vast library of original programming to help keep subscribers on board as it faces tougher competition.Amazon, for instance, ; previously, you had to sign up for the company\u2019s $100-a-year Prime service, which includes free shipping from its e-commerce site and other goodies.Amazon is undercutting Netflix\u2019s $10 monthly price for its most popular video-streaming plan, as is Hulu, which charges $8. HBO charges $15 per month for a video-streaming service it launched last year to compete against Netflix.Netflix will test the loyalty of its long-time subscribers next month when it starts to hike their prices 25 per cent, following a two-year freeze that kept rates at $8 per month. The increase will hit 17 million to 22 million U.S. subscribers, based on analyst estimates.Original programming doesn\u2019t come cheap. The Los Gatos, California, company ended March with $12.3 billion committed to Internet streaming rights, nearly double the $5.6 billion it spend at the end of 2012. Netflix hasn\u2019t disclosed how much of that spending has gone toward original series and exclusive movies, but the percentage has been steadily increasing.The cost of licensing and overseas expansion has whittled Netflix\u2019s profit margins. In its first-quarter results released late Monday, the company said it earned $28 million, or 6 cents per share, on revenue of nearly $2 billion. Investors, though, are far more focused the company\u2019s subscriber growth.So far, the company has delivered. Netflix picked up an additional 6.74 million customers in the first quarter to boost its worldwide audience to 81.5 million subscribers \u2013 up from 33 million before the first season of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Such gains helped propel Netflix\u2019s share price, which has more than quadrupled since then, creating about $36 billion in shareholder wealth.But Netflix\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 8 per cent in extended trading late Monday after the company predicted it would only add 2.5 million subscribers in the second quarter, including a gain of 500,000 customers in the U.S. The conservative forecast reflected the anticipated loss of some longtime subscribers due to the price increase.There\u2019s a worrisome history here. In 2011, subscribers fled when Netflix split off its DVD-by-mail operation from its burgeoning streaming business, a shift that hiked prices as much as 60 per cent for some subscribers.Netflix lost 3 per cent of its U.S. subscribers at the time. A similar reaction to next month\u2019s price increase might cost it 510,000 to 660,000 subscribers in the second quarter.Analysts think a repeat is unlikely. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are going to see a lot of people bailing out and running for the exits,\u201d said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen \u2013 largely because Netflix now has so many shows you can\u2019t find anywhere else.That original programming appears to be a major draw for many subscribers. In a recent online survey of 2,500 U.S. adults conducted by Morgan Stanley, 45 per cent cited it as a reason to subscribe to Netflix.HBO, however, still has a huge advantage over Netflix in terms of prestige. Last year, HBO won 43 Emmys, more than any other TV network, while Netflix\u2019s original programs garnered just four \u2013 one less than Amazon.com.', u'Tech companies have a duty to co-operate with police: BlackBerry CEOWATERLOO, Ont. \u2013 The head of  says tech companies have a duty to be \u201cgood corporate citizens\u201d who co-operate with reasonable lawful requests from the police.The comments were in response to a story last week by ,  as part of an investigation between 2010 and 2012.The probe, dubbed \u201cProject Clemenza,\u201d involved the killing of a Mafia crime family member.In a blog post Monday, BlackBerry chief executive John Chen said  apprehend criminals.Chen wrote that the world is a \u201cdark place\u201d when companies put their reputations above the greater good.He noted that the case resulted in a major criminal organization being dismantled.', u'Here are the worst toxins Apple removed from the iPhoneOne of Apple\u2019s main objectives, besides increasing iPhone sales, is improving its environmental sustainability \u2013 from finding new ways to recycle iPhone parts, to ensuring its data centres run on renewable energy.But Apple has also been busy making sure its products contain fewer toxins than its competitors.In its  the company identified some of the worst toxins found in its products and when they were removed.For example, did you know arsenic is traditionally used in display glass?According to Apple, its display glass has been arsenic-free since 2008.Apple also eliminated the use of mercury \u2013 usually found in LED smartphone displays \u2013 in 2009.Apple\u2019s environmental responsibility report also revealed some interesting numbers about its recycling efforts.The report states that Apple recovered 2,204 pounds of gold and 6,612 pounds of silver, worth millions of dollars, from old devices recycled by users.During its media event in March, the company announced the addition of a new iPhone disabling robot named \u201cLiam,\u201d which will take iPhones apart piece by piece in order to reuse some of the materials inside.', u'Fan sues Kanye West for tricking him into subscribing to TidalLOS ANGELES \u2013 A  fan is suing over the rapper\u2019s claim that his latest album would only be available to subscribers of the music streaming service Tidal.The proposed class action lawsuit filed Monday in a federal court in San Francisco by Justin Baker-Rhett states that he was duped into subscribing to Tidal based on West\u2019s promises that his  would only be available there and not anywhere else. The album is now available on Apple Music and Spotify.An email sent to Tidal seeking comment was not immediately returned.The lawsuit alleges the promise of exclusive access to West\u2019s latest album led to an influx of new Tidal subscribers and allowed the service to collect users\u2019 personal information.', u'Windows users: Uninstall Apple\u2019s QuickTime from your computer immediatelyIf you still use  QuickTime for Windows video player, you should uninstall it as soon as possible., the software contains two critical security vulnerabilities that puts users at risk of viruses and security threats.However, Apple will no longer be providing security updates for QuickTime for Windows, which means the vulnerabilities won\u2019t be fixed. to Windows users last week, urging them to uninstall the software, after learning about the security concerns.\u201cComputers running QuickTime for Windows will continue to work after support ends.

I couldn\u2019t argue with them anymore.\u201dBell\u2019s experience is far from rare. Daily complaints on Facebook and Twitter suggest lockdowns in so-called \u201cFacebook jail\u201d have been a regular occurrence for years, and often for unclear reasons.Technology lawyer David Fewer questions why the social media giant can\u2019t verify users through other means.

And by and large, organizations like Facebook generally don\u2019t want to store such data since it increases their liabilities, with Fewer likening them to \u201cticking time bombs\u201d waiting for a security breach.Bell says she initially tried to regain access to her account by sending other documents proving her identity, including a trading card, links to articles with her name, and links to website bios.That initially permitted her to re-enter her account, but she was locked out again when another administrator said she needed more proof.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to advertise it.\u201dIn her case, she says using her real name actually limited her social circle.

[u'Haida Gwaii caught in the midst of world plastic pollutionBritish Columbia\u2019s Haida Gwaii islands, with their\xa0long, rugged coastlines, temperate rainforest and unique wildlife, attract people from around the world to an area often referred to as \u2018the\xa0Galapagos of the North.\u2019But what most travellers don\u2019t expect to see on their visit to Haida Gwaii is the amount of plastic waste that washes up on the islands\u2019 supposedly immaculate\xa0shores.Because of their geographical location in\xa0the Pacific Ocean, far from the B.C. mainland, the islands of Haida Gwaii have always been hit by a steady influx of marine debris.But in recent years, the amount of plastic items drifting ashore has been growing, raising concern for local residents.The beaches of Haida Gwaii that are accessible to the general public get the benefit of beachcombers\xa0cleaning up some of\xa0the debris. But some of the more remote locations, only accessible by boat or air, nearly never get cleaned up, leaving debris to pile up.Taking a stroll down the remote,\xa0sandy\xa0East Beach, on the northeastern tip of Haida Gwaii, you can go for miles without seeing another human-being.But the signs of civilization can be seen\xa0everywhere.Poking out of the sand and jammed between beach logs, are\xa0plastic bottles, containers, marine buoys, fishing baskets and gear, pieces of Styrofoam, used tires, and even\xa0toothbrushes\xa0and rubber\xa0shoes.But it\u2019s what you don\u2019t immediately\xa0see that shows the true\xa0extent of the problem.Tiny pieces of\xa0broken-up\xa0plastic, sometimes only a few millimetres\xa0in diameter, are so numerous they often mix in with the sand \u2014 making it virtually impossible for even some of the more experienced beachcombers to see and pick up.\u201cSometimes you cruise by in a boat and it looks like the beach is clean, but then you look\xa0under the\xa0logs\xa0and\xa0there are tiny pieces of plastic everywhere,\u201d says Trent Moraes, a local resident whose company, Highlander Marine Services Ltd., helps\xa0clean up the debris.Plastic is used in many aspects of our daily lives because of\xa0how cheap and durable it is.A \xa0released in January suggests plastic production has surged over the past 50 years, from 15 million tonnes in 1964 to 311 million tonnes in 2014.The number is expected to double again over the next 20 years.But, the report also suggests that if our plastic consumption habits stay the way they are, oceans are expected to contain more plastics than fish by year 2050., including some\xa0,\xa0and at least  leak into the ocean every year.The tiny pieces of plastic that Moraes and other island residents have been noticing in recent years are the result of plastic debris getting weathered and pulverized by the force of the ocean.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says plastic will\xa0 until you can\u2019t see it anymore, but it never really fully goes away.Instead, it\xa0breaks\xa0down into smaller and smaller pieces, a process that\u2019s exacerbated by UV radiation, saltwater and the force of the surf.That means every single piece of plastic ever created still exists today.In fact,  a single one-litre plastic bottle could break down into enough small fragments to put one on every mile of beach in the entire world.NOAA says plastic debris can accumulate\xa0 up to 100,000 to 1,000,000 times the levels found in seawater. While it\u2019s still unclear whether these pollutants can seep from plastic debris into the organisms that happen to eat the debris, there is a serious concern that these contaminants may transfer through the food chain and all the way up to human consumption.Researchers have found small pieces of plastic\xa0found in the stomachs of many marine organisms, from plankton to whales. When fish and other marine life ingest small pieces of plastic, it could cause irritation or do damage to their digestive system,\xa0leading\xa0to malnutrition or starvation. plastic debris causes the deaths of more than a million seabirds every year, as well as more than 100,000 marine mammals.In Haida Gwaii, the problem is further exacerbated by powerful storms pushing deteriorated plastic along with other debris all the way up into the\xa0tree line, where it becomes part of the\xa0forest ecosystem, buried in the greenery and covered by moss \u2013 a\xa0disturbing\xa0sight for\xa0locals and tourists alike.The trick is to remove plastic debris from local\xa0beaches before it gets churned by the sea and pushed into the tree line, where it starts\xa0disintegrating to the point where removal is virtually impossible.After the , it was expected that Haida Gwaii would be hit with an increased volume of marine debris.So, in 2013, after the Japanese government offered Canada $1 million to help support the tsunami clean-up effort, community members joined forces to take things into their own hands and formed the Haida Gwaii Tsunami Debris Committee.The committee\xa0received a chunk of the Japanese funding \u2014 about $139,000. That allowed the group to hire contractors from around Haida Gwaii to\xa0clean up nearly 40 kilometers of local beaches and remove some 630 cubic meters of debris.Some of the debris is undoubtedly from Japan, but a substantial amount is what they just call \u201cworld garbage.\u201d\u201cMost of the plastic is not from a source that we can control,\u201d said marine ecologist Lynn Lee, a member of the Haida Gwaii Tsunami Debris Committee.\xa0\u201cIt comes from the Great Pacific garbage patch, industrial waste, fishing vessels.\u201cThese things happen outside of the boundaries of Haida Gwaii,\xa0but they are affecting\xa0the region.\u201dContractors have to use specialized trucks and boats to remove the debris from the remote beaches around Haida Gwaii \u2014 and\xa0they\u2019re usually filled up to capacity.\u201cWe can fill a boat within hours sometimes,\u201d said Moraes.The committee is also experimenting with using a helicopter to lift the debris out of very remote areas, but that would require substantially more money. The committee got an additional $115,000 from Japanese debris clean-up money this year. But this is\xa0the final round of funding, which officially runs out\xa0in March\xa02017.The committee is also looking into the possibility of chartering a barge to remove a larger amount of the debris all at one time. While\xa0it may not be economically feasible at this point, the debris collected on\xa0a barge could be shipped to a recycling facility.Currently, a great deal\xa0of\xa0the collected marine garbage\xa0ends up at a local landfill. A few\xa0items\xa0get recycled\xa0by local fishermen and a small portion goes into a smaller local recycling operation, but the majority of the debris, including deteriorated plastics, are left to rot in the ground.Moraes and others are looking into bringing in technology that could potentially convert marine garbage into biofuel.James Cowpar,\xa0the operator of local tour company called Haida Styles, said guides often take guests to areas heavily impacted by plastic pollution.The reaction is nearly always the same \u2013 people are stunned by what they see\xa0and want\xa0to help.\u201cYou can imagine going to an ancient village site in Gwaii Haanas and the first thing you are going to see is garbage,\u201d said Cowpar. \u201cWe have actually taken guests out to participate [in the clean-ups] and we found it very rewarding.\xa0While on tour, we try to grab as much [garbage] as we can.\u201dHe said educating visitors and talking about\xa0the bigger picture is part of their company\u2019s mandate.Part of their effort to help mitigate the situation involves not\xa0carrying plastic water bottles for their clients on\xa0their tour boats and using\xa0water containers with reusable cups instead.So far, he said, the reaction from their guests\xa0has been nothing but positive.\u201cGlobal pollution is a huge problem,\u201d said Cowpar. \u201cPeople believe that national parks and protected areas are free of pollution and that\u2019s\xa0simply\xa0not the case. It tends to be an indirect dumping ground.\u201dWith the Japanese funding drying up, Moraes\xa0said\xa0he wants to see more support from all levels of Canadian government.He\xa0said there should also be a feasibility study done on how to handle the amount of the debris coming in the\xa0future.\u201cThere is so much work to be done. We have been going strong for the last few years, but we are still not even close to getting it all collected,\u201d\xa0said Moraes. \u201cWe really need to figure something out for the long-term: find some dedicated money for this. The province and the federal government really should step up and address this huge issue.\u201dThe B.C. Ministry of Environment told Global News\xa0there are no immediate plans to fund the non-tsunami debris clean-up. The ministry said\xa0further resources will be allocated as necessary\xa0if a\xa0major increase in tsunami debris is experienced.But Lucy Stefanyk, the Haida Gwaii supervisor with BC Parks and a member of the committee, said marine debris, including plastics, will\xa0always be\xa0something that they\xa0will continue to grapple with.Lee said raising awareness about marine garbage in Haida Gwaii\xa0is also an opportunity to show the world\xa0how its actions somewhere far away are having an impact on\xa0a place like\xa0the islands.\u201cThere is no easy solution aside from minimizing plastic production and use,\u201d Lee said.Canada produces about  of the total world volume of plastic products. Canadian and worldwide demand for plastic products are expected to continue growing faster than the economy as a whole.Currently, Canadians take home an estimated , for a total of 2.86 billion bags per year.Canadians also consume more than , and globally, we consume about 190 billion litres a year.\u201cReduce what you are consuming, reduce the overusing,\u201d said Lee, adding plastic pollution is just a symptom of a larger\xa0problem.', u'SpaceX attempts to launch satellite into orbit, land another rocketSpaceX will attempt to launch another rocket into space Friday\xa0from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.The private spacecraft company will then try to land the rocket at sea for the third time in two months.The Falcon 9 rocket will be sending communication satellite Thaicom 8 into a distant orbit. The extra-long trip means the rocket will be travelling at a faster speed towards earth when it attempts to land on one of SpaceX\u2019s spaceport drone ships. earlier in the month after delivering a Japanese communications satellite into orbit. In April, \xa0on a sea platform\xa0after delivering cargo to the International Space Station.SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk has said that developing reusable rockets is key to saving launch costs and making space travel more accessible.', u'WATCH: Proposed bus in China allows cars to drive underneath itDrivers who get frustrated being stuck behind stop-and-go buses on busy streets, causing a back-up of traffic, might appreciate this newly proposed bus unveiled in China.The Transit Elevated Bus (TEB)\xa0that\xa0straddles the street, was unveiled at the  in Beijing last weekend.The bus could carry more than a thousand passengers and take up no space on the road, allowing traffic to flow smoothly beneath it. In a country with about 20 million new drivers hitting the road each year, and one that is battling intensive air pollution,\xa0the proposal is one that appears to be quite inviting.The bus could ease traffic congestion, as well as become more inviting for commuters.However, it\u2019s unclear as to how feasible it will be as the model only used cars and didn\u2019t include trucks and other large\xa0vehicles. As well, no safety barriers were in place in the model, which could raise safety concerns.', u'NASA inflates expandable room on the space stationCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2013 It\u2019s pump-it-up day at the International Space Station.NASA is releasing air into an inflatable room delivered last month by SpaceX. If all goes well, the pod will swell four times in volume and demonstrate a new way of living for astronauts. The hour-long process began Thursday morning 250 miles above Earth.Astronaut Jeffrey Williams opened a valve that allowed air to slowly flow into the inflatable chamber, called BEAM. That stands for Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. It\u2019s the creation of Bigelow Aerospace, founded by hotel entrepreneur Robert Bigelow. NASA paid the North Las Vegas company $17.8 million to test the inflatable-habitat concept at the space station.Williams and his crewmates won\u2019t venture inside BEAM \u2013 the world\u2019s first inflatable room for astronauts \u2013 until next week.', u'Alberta Oilsands are one of the largest contributors to aerosol air pollution: studyOTTAWA \u2013 A new study in the journal Nature finds that  are one of the largest sources of organic aerosol air pollution in North America.Data from airborne measurements over the bitumen-producing region found that oilsands production contributes at least 45 to 84 tonnes a day of the tiny particulate matter \u2013 comparable to mega-cities such as Paris and Mexico City.The study, whose lead co-author is an Environment Canada scientist, says secondary organic aerosol production should be taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impact of current and planned oilsands development.And it suggests heavy-oil extraction projects around the globe are likely large sources of this type of air pollution.Secondary organic aerosols are produced when volatile organic compounds interact with sunlight and other airborne chemicals to create tiny particles, which have been found to cause lung and heart problems and other health effects.The Nature study found that low-volatility organic vapours from mined oilsands material is directly responsible for the majority of the observed secondary organic aerosols downwind from oilsands projects.', u'Provinces slow to cover new drugs after approval, makers complainProvinces can take up to 15 months to cover new drugs in their drug plans after they\u2019re approved by Health Canada, a group of drug makers announced today.The delays hurt \u201cvulnerable populations in Canada, such as seniors or those fighting cancer, who are generally covered by public drug plans,\u201d said Isabelle Robillard of , a group of Canadian pharmaceutical companies.The group presented their  at a news conference Tuesday in Ottawa.Private drug plans are \u201cbetter, more generous and faster than what we see in the (public) drug plans in Canada,\u201d said Brett Skinner, the group\u2019s executive director.The group said that it normally took 449 days from Health Canada approving a new drug as safe and effective to provincial plans starting to cover it, a delay that it said placed Canada 15th on a list of 20 industrialized countries.Provincial health ministries are also stingy about covering new medicines at all, the study showed \u2013 only 37 per cent of new medicines ended up being covered by provincial drug plans. The group said that placed Canada 18th out of 20 countries.Provinces make their own decisions about what drugs to cover, to what extent, and what conditions to apply. Provincial drug benefit programs largely cover the poor, disabled and elderly. Eleven million people are eligible for provincial and territorial drug plans, Skinner said.The study looked at larger-population provinces, which between them make up about 80 per cent of Canada\u2019s population, to compare with other countries\u2019 systems.Health Minister Jane Philpott says that adopting a pharmacare policy may be achievable in the future but right now the Liberals are focusing on bringing down prescription costs for big government purchasers.An official from British Colombia\u2019s health ministry says they are aware of the study and are reviewing it.\u201cWe base our drug-coverage decisions on a rigorous review of clinical evidence to ensure we are consistently covering the most beneficial drugs for our patients,\u201d Stephen May told Global News in an email.', u"Thieves in Ohio make off with deaf four-year-old\u2019s cochlear implantPolice in Columbus, Ohio are investigating a routine smash-and-grab robbery that was anything but routine for one little boy.Four-year-old Sora Coate, who is deaf in both ears, received a cochlear implant in his left ear on May 17.

He said the United States and some other countries have abandoned the use of winged reusable spacecraft, but India hopes to bring down the cost of access to space by 90 per cent by using reusable vehicles.\u201cIn this flight, critical technologies such as autonomous navigation, guidance and control, reusable thermal protection system and re-entry mission management have been successfully validated,\u201d the space agency said in a statement.India hopes to become a player in the multi-billion-dollar space launch market, and has successfully placed light satellites into orbit in recent years.It hopes eventually to send astronauts into space.In September 2014, it successfully guided a .

By early morning, it had moved through suburban Inglewood. Crews trimmed a few trees and unbolted a stoplight pole and turned it so the arm wouldn\u2019t hit the towering tank.Freeway drivers got a shock as the tank rolled by on a bridge over Interstate 405, an artery west of downtown that was busy even on Saturday morning.The shuttle was escorted by police, a fire truck and a crew of city officials as it passed through south Los Angeles taco shops, car washes and strip malls. Many people stood with their cellphones, trying to capture the perfect shot \u2013 and a selfie.\u201cWhen you look at the people who are out here, it\u2019s little kids, it\u2019s older folks, it\u2019s white folks, it\u2019s black folks, it\u2019s Latino folks,\u201d said Shelly Arsneault, 49, of Whittier. \u201cIt\u2019s everybody. It\u2019s cool. It\u2019s LA.\u201dChildren, a few wearing home-made space helmets, were enthralled.Cindy Hernandez, 11, of Inglewood, said the tank was \u201camazing.\u201d\u201cIt will be a memory for me,\u201d she said.\t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s this next generation of explorers. These kids are going to remember today their whole lives. And they\u2019re going to think about it when they choose their career paths. They\u2019re going to study harder in school. And it\u2019s going to make us happy,\u201d astronaut Mike Fincke, who flew on the Endeavour\u2019s final flight in 2011, told the Los Angeles Times.\u201cIt really makes me feel that a lot of people appreciate what our space program is doing,\u201d said Sandy Magnus, another astronaut. \u201cDays like this I think are days that bring us all together.\u201dThe tank will be displayed upright along with the shuttle and two solid-rocket boosters, as if ready for takeoff.The journey was expected to take 13 to 18 hours to squeeze down 16 1/2 miles of streets, avenues and boulevards to Exposition Park near downtown.The trek drew smaller crowds than the journey of the 122-foot-long Endeavour. With a wingspan of 78 feet, the orbiter was similarly hauled 12 miles to the centre from Los Angeles International Airport. Extensive preparations for Endeavour\u2019s trek included removing trees, street posts and other obstacles, but that journey still took about 17 hours longer than planned.Although longer, the external tank is much narrower than the shuttle, with a diameter of 27.5 feet.The tank was shipped to California by barge from a NASA facility in Louisiana. The tank travelled through the Panama Canal to the Pacific and arrived at Marina del Rey, a yacht harbour on the Los Angeles County coast where it was offloaded to await the weekend move.The move Saturday began with a bit of fanfare. A New Orleans-style jazz band played \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In,\u201d and some people waved handkerchiefs to wish the tank bon voyage.Known as ET-94, it was NASA\u2019s last flight-qualified external tank, but it was never used before the shuttle program came to an end.External tanks not only carried propellant for space shuttles\u2019 main engines, they were the backbone of the launch system. An orbiter and two solid rocket boosters would be attached to the tank for the fiery ascent into space.Inside ET-94 are two internal tanks for millions of pounds of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen as well as other equipment.The tank\u2019s surface is covered with a layer of foam to keep the propellants at the proper temperature, reduce the formation of ice and to provide protection from heat as it sped through the atmosphere.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tExternal tanks used on shuttle missions would be destroyed, burning up as they fell back through the atmosphere after being discarded by the orbiter.ET-94 was built for use by the shuttle Columbia, which disintegrated over Texas as it was returning from a mission. The investigation found that foam fell off that mission\u2019s external tank during launch and punched a hole into a wing, allowing hot gases of the fiery re-entry inside the structure. Investigators used many pieces of foam from ET-94 in tests to come to the conclusion.', u'El Ni\xf1o forces carbon dioxide levels to jump record amounts in AprilWASHINGTON \u2013 The amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air jumped by the biggest amount on record last month, a rise amplified by El Ni\xf1o, scientists say.Carbon dioxide levels increased by 4.16 parts per million in April compared to a year earlier, according to readings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Until this year, the biggest increase was 3.7 ppm. Records go back to 1950.April\u2019s carbon dioxide level of 407.42 was a record 2.59 ppm rise from March. Carbon dioxide levels are cyclical, peaking in May and then dropping until fall. That\u2019s on top of a steady 2.5 to 3 ppm yearly increase from the burning of fossil fuels, which means each year the world sets new record for levels of heat-trapping gas in the air.The increase \u201cis the biggest we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said NOAA global atmospheric monitoring director Jim Butler .El Ni\xf1o is a natural warming of part of the Pacific that changes weather worldwide and warms the globe a bit. In many places El Ni\xf1o means more drought and fires, which release more carbon dioxide into the air and decreases carbon dioxide sucked up by plants, said NOAA senior scientist Pieter Tans, who keeps track of greenhouse gases.\t\t\t\n\t\tButler said scientists need to watch measurements over the next several months or even a year to see how much of this large increase is an El Ni\xf1o-driven blip that will go away as the weather phenomenon fades and is replaced by its cool flip side, La Nina.It\u2019s not just that carbon dioxide levels are growing, but that they\u2019ve been growing at a record faster pace over the past four years, even without El Ni\xf1o, Tans said.A recent study shows a slowing and even levelling of carbon dioxide spewed by the burning of fossil fuels. There\u2019s a five-to-10 year lag before those changes are noticeable in the atmosphere, so emissions are a better indicator of progress \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 in fighting global warming, said Corinne Le Quere who monitors emissions at the University of East Anglia in England.The trouble is, even if emissions stop growing and plateau at the current amount, carbon', u'Unlock the hidden FM radio locked in smartphones, broadcasters urge providersFort McMurray\u2019s ferocious wildfire\xa0ignited a\xa0hungry need for information among the people fleeing it.People shared video on Facebook, evacuees tried to keep track of family members \xa0and officials updated residents on Twitter.In a disaster, however, mobile devices have two vulnerabilities \u2014 the ever-dwindling battery and their dependence on a complex, fragile wireless system that thousands of other people are also frantically using.Cell towers are just as vulnerable to a disaster like a wildfire as any other piece of infrastructure.But when the battery winks out, or your phone can\u2019t connect to a network, there\u2019s always radio.Perhaps surprisingly, your phone may be able to switch roles and work as a traditional FM radio \u2014 if its maker, or your wireless company, allows it. (In that case, the phone is literally a radio, not a mobile device streaming audio.)To work, the device needs headphones, to work as an antenna. You don\u2019t have to listen on the headphones \u2014 they just have to be attached.\u201cThe FM radio chip is just like a regular receiver that you have in your car, or on your home stereo,\u201d explains\xa0Barry Rooke of the\xa0National Campus and Community Radio Association.The organization is to have wireless carriers allow the capability.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s already in most Android phones, already on Blackberry phones. \xa0It\u2019s something that\u2019s just not accessible to people right now because either the telecom provider or the manufacturer hasn\u2019t enabled it for the public to use.\u201dIn radio mode, a smartphone uses very little battery power and doesn\u2019t need connectivity, Rooke explains.Radio is a traditional way for governments to with people during a disaster \u2014 radios are cheap, very common and use little electricity, and communication is instant.What phones have an FM radio chip? The makers of the app say that it works on 67 devices made by 10 manufacturers. The list includes 21 Samsung phones.Apple Iphones are sold with an FM chip that isn\u2019t activated, says a\xa0\xa0released by the U.S. National Association of Broadcasters.\xa0(Apple did not respond to a request for comment.)Nearly all smartphones sold in the U.S. have a radio chip, but only about a quarter have one that\u2019s activated or easily activated.Apple is a \u201ctough nut to crack,\u201d says\xa0B.C. Association of Broadcasters president Kevin Gemmell.\u201cBlackberry \u2014 the chip is generally available, certain platforms of Android \u2014 the chips are widely available at this point in time. So, it\u2019s really iPhone, but iPhone is also a huge piece of the market share.\u201dFor your phone to work as a radio, it has to have an FM chip installed and your provider has to be on board.Carriers are reluctant to allow the technology because they don\u2019t want to lose the bandwith used for streaming audio, Gemmell says.\u201cIt\u2019s not that they have a hate on for radio, or for our technology, or for what we do. I think they were just trying to monetize as best they can.\u201d\u201cWe have a lot of devices that have that chip enabled. And it\u2019s the manufacturer\u2019s choice whether the functionality is available,\u201d said Telus spokesperson Luiza Staniec. \u201cSome have it enabled and some are not.\u201dTelus does offer devices that can be used as radios,\xa0Staniec says.\u201cThe decision to enable FM chips on devices lies solely with the manufacturers,\u201d Rogers spokesperson Andrew Garas said. \u201cSelect devices already have FM chips enabled, and we anticipate there will be more in the future.\u201dBell and Shaw Communications did not respond to a request for comment.The technology would have a crucial role in an emergency when \u201cyour smartphone becomes a brick,\u201d says\xa0Craig Fugate, head of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Administration.\u201cThere\u2019s this tendency to think that things that work in our everyday lives are going to work the same way in a disaster,\u201d he \xa0in a Youtube video.\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to reach any of my friends,\u201d remembers Fort McMurray evacuee Vishal Shukla, who spoke to Global News reporter Jill Croteau Thursday. \u201cThe telephone was not working. The tower fell down, or something. I think the FM radio stuff is a good and brilliant idea, and if it was in place I would have for sure used that.\u201d', u'Long awaited tidal power turbine heading to Bay of Fundy next monthThe first of two towering turbines designed by Cape Sharp Tidal to harness the immense power of the Bay of Fundy will be installed next month off the coast of Nova Scotia, an company official announced Thursday.Sarah Dawson, the community relations manager for the project, said one of the five-storey high, two-megawatt turbines built in Pictou by Aecon Atlantic Industrial Inc., will be loaded on a barge during the first week of June and travel around the province until it reaches the test site near Parrsboro.That trip will take a couple of weeks.\u201cOur project aims to deploy two two-megawatt hydro devices at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) site, just west of Parrsboro, and we\u2019re aiming to put both of those turbines in the water this year,\u201d Dawson said.The turbine, which is 16-metres in diameter and weighs 1,000 tonnes, was originally scheduled for deployment last year, but Dawson said it was delayed by weather.Cape Sharp Tidal \u2013 which is a partnership of OpenHydro and Emera \u2013 has not revealed the total cost of the project, but Dawson said the company has committed to spend 70 per cent of the overall cost in Nova Scotia.She said once connected to the power grid, the turbines will provide enough electricity for about 1,000 homes.The new turbines are a bigger and more robust version of a turbine tested by OpenHydro and Nova Scotia Power in 2009 that was heavily damaged by the Bay of Fundy\u2019s powerful currents.Meanwhile, Black Rock Tidal Power Inc., has announced that its tidal power platform will also be built by Aecon and installed at the same test site near Parrsboro in 2017.Their TRITON S40 uses 40 smaller turbines, each about four metres in diameter, and is expected to generate 2.5 megawatts.\u201cBecause the TRITON can be easily brought to the surface it allows for easy maintenance access. The use of multiple small turbines together with TRITON\u2019s maintenance approach reduces both capital and maintenance costs,\u201d said Nils Hirsch, general manager of Black Rock Tidal Power.He said a lot has been learned from the failed project in 2009, and his company\u2019s unique design has been successful under simulation tests.A total of five companies from around the world have been awarded a demonstration site at the FORCE test facility.It is considered Canada\u2019s leading research centre for tidal energy.', u'Toronto paleontologist claims Tyrannosaurus Rex had lipsTORONTO \u2013 One of the world\u2019s most famous predators, the fearsome Tyrannosaurus Rex is typically shown baring dozens of sharp, jagged teeth \u2013 but a Toronto researcher says the carnivore likely had lips to cover them.Robert Reisz, a professor at the University of Toronto who specializes in vertebrate paleontology, says that contrary to what\u2019s shown in movies and even museums, T. Rex and his fellow theropods would not have teeth that stick out even when their mouths are closed.His research is set to be presented Friday at a conference of the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology conference, held at the university\u2019s Mississauga campus. The two-day conference begins Thursday.Reisz says only a few land animals, such as elephants and wild boars, have exposed teeth and these have no enamel.Meanwhile, the only animal with bared teeth that have enamel is the crocodile, which is aquatic.Reisz says theropods, which include other well-known dinosaurs such as velociraptors and Albertosaurus, were land animals whose teeth had enamel, making it far more likely they had lips.Though more work needs to be done to reconstruct what the ancient creatures would have looked like, \u201call the evidence right now points to the likelihood that they actually had their teeth covered by essentially scaly lips,\u201d he said.In reconstructing what dinosaurs looked like, scientists rely on preserved anatomy \u2013 typically bones, but sometimes skin and feathers \u2013 and comparisons with modern animals, said Caleb Brown, a paleontologist working at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alta.\u201cAnd then a lot of it is artistic licence,\u201d said Brown, who has not seen Reisz\u2019s research.\u201cYou have to estimate somewhere. One of the big ones we don\u2019t know about is colour. We\u2019re getting some details about colour from feathered dinosaurs but when we just have skin preserved we don\u2019t know what colour they are.\u201dWhether or not theropods had lips has yet to be determined, and that debate plays out in popular culture as well as scientific circles, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an ongoing joke in that when you draw a dinosaur, particularly a theropod, one of the meat-eating dinosaurs, you always portray it with the mouth open and with these teeth being shown,\u201d he said.But it\u2019s also because for some dinosaurs, the teeth are the part that paleontologists know best, since more are available, and it seems counterintuitive to hide them in displays, he said.If if turns out that theropods did have lips, there would be scientific implications for how they chewed and processed food, Brown said.Still, \u201cthe biggest change that you would see would be in how these are portrayed to the public in what we call paleo art, or artists\u2019 reconstructions of these animals,\u201d which then trickles down to movies and museum exhibits, he said.Reisz said the popular depiction in movies such as the \u201cJurassic Park\u201d franchise has annoyed him \u201cfor a very long time because there is no real biology behind it.\u201dAside from their lack of lips, theropods are shown in movies without feathers and \u201clooking emaciated,\u201d which he said is also incorrect.Though the issue has been a longtime frustration, Reisz said he began researching it a year ago and plans to turn his presentation into a paper to be submitted for peer review.', u'WATCH: Close-up view of Mercury transit seen from spaceOn May 9, telescopes around the world were turned toward the sun to witness a rare event: Mercury passing in front of the sun. Space telescopes also had their eyes aimed on our nearest star, and one of them has provided us with a close-up view of the event.The video shows a composite image of NASA\u2019s Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) together with NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).When a planet passes in front of a star, or a moon passes in front of a planet, it\u2019s called a transit.Transits of Mercury occur, on average, every 13 years. The next one will be in 2019.Rarer still are transits of Venus, which occur once every eight years and then once every 105 years. The last transit of Venus was in 2012.', u'Video surfaces of Texas students skipping rope with cat\u2019s intestines during classA newly surfaced video is causing outrage for one\xa0animal rights groups after it shows students at a Texas high school appearing to play jump rope \u2014 with a cat\u2019s intestines.The school board says the unconventional choice of classroom activity was simply a lesson on biology and anatomy.The videos went viral late Tuesday night after they were sent to the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) by what the organization calls a \u201cconcerned whistleblower.\u201dRecorded inside a classroom at Winston Churchill High School in San Antonio, Texas, the amateur video shows students skipping rope with what is allegedly a length of cat intestine during a dissection.\u201cChurchill [High School] officials have an obligation to make sure this never happens again,\u201d PETA said in According to local media reports, the class is a mix of junior (Grade 11) and senior (Grade 12) students.While the video went viral Tuesday night, it appears to have been posted on May 12 to the  by San Antonio resident Nikky Alie.\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough animals are being killed for this, but using their organs as toys is unethical,\u201d Alie wrote in her original post. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let Churchill students and faculty continue to believe this is acceptable.\u201dIt appears Alie was contacted about her story some days later by either PETA or local media as she posted a follow-up on Tuesday afternoon.\u201cThank you to all the supporters and even the haters who helped spread awareness through the activity on this post,\u201d she wrote  \u201cI was contacted by the media and this post will soon be on the news!\u201dIn response to the anger generated by the video\u2019s release, the Northeast Independent School District\xa0is defending the choice of classroom activity as helping to teach the fundamentals of anatomy.\u201cThis exercise was not meant to be degrading or disrespectful,\u201d NEISD executive director of communications, Aubrey Chancellor, told Global News.Chancellor said the teacher who organized the activity did the same thing during her time as a student at Texas A&M University.\u201cIt does looks bad,\u201d 18-year-old Winston Churchill student Ashlei Walsh  \u201cIt\u2019s really educational. It wasn\u2019t just for fun or any of that.\u201dAccording to , a cat\u2019s small intestines are about two-and-a-half times the length of the animal, so a two-foot-long cat would have a small intestine of over 60\xa0inches.The school board says they have no plans to cancel dissections in their schools but are planning to look into alternatives such as digital or online dissection simulations.\u201cWe do understand that best practices change over time, and we are planning on moving forward and find a different, more appropriate lesson\xa0to demonstrate [tensile strength],\u201d Chancellor told Global NewsChancellor says\xa0the school board has no plans to discipline either the teacher or the student as there was \u201cno ill intent\u201d in the lesson.', u'WATCH: Weather observers battle 175 km/h wind gusts on top of Mount WashingtonWeather observers stationed at the Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire took a \u201cbrief break\u201d earlier this week to \u201cenjoy\u201d wintry conditions that saw winds top out at 175 kilometres an hour.The observatory released a video Monday showing weather observers Mike Dorfman and Tom Padham battling insane winds that nearly lifted them off their feet.The video shows Dorfman on the snow-covered summit being lifted by the wind and blown backwards, sending the man rolling on the ground.\u201cWind on the summit is an experience that you can\u2019t just describe to understand,\u201d Dorfman said in a  accompanying the video. \u201cIt makes you fully appreciate that air is in fact a fluid and not empty space.\u201cIt is really impossible to safely face down hundred-mile-per-hour winds almost anywhere else; you\u2019d either be risking your life trying to hike into them (I was exhausted after several minutes of playing in the wind) or risking your life in a hurricane, where flying debris and shrapnel poses a huge threat,\u201d Dorfman wrote.Mount Washington is the highest point in the northeastern United States, topping out at 6,288 feet above sea level.

While most are tiny and cause small flashes in the sky, every so often a larger piece enters our atmosphere, burning up and illuminating the sky, sometimes far brighter than the moon. These types of meteors are referred to as bolides.We are currently in the midst of a meteor shower, the Eta Aquarids. However,\xa0it is unclear as to whether or not the fireball was associated with it.', u'Reality check: How do you know the fish you buy is sustainable?Is \u201csustainable seafood\u201d really sustainable?In a 2011 survey, the World Wildlife Fund found that 91 per cent of Canadians want sustainable seafood. But only eight per cent feel like they have enough information on where the seafood they buy comes from.That\u2019s a huge gap in knowledge.So how do you know if the fish you buy is sustainable?The same survey found 65 per cent look to the grocery store or the packaging to find out whether the seafood they buy is sustainable, so it\u2019s extremely important to make sure the labels are correct.But a new study from researchers in Denmark questions whether a label should really be the standard for \u201csustainable.\u201dThe study, titled \xa0was based on a European Union funded research project called MYFISH and raises questions about the process it takes to label a product.In Canada and around the world, various organizations will provide certification on a fishery\u2019s sustainability (i.e. how well they sustain fish stocks and minimize environmental impacts).The most recognized label is the Marine Stewardship Council, a not-for-profit company that is known as a global standard for sustainable fishing.This label is used as a market tool to open up new places to sell a company\u2019s fish and give customers an incentive to buy the product.The study claims using the label as a market tool is leading to a decrease of standards \u201cin order to satisfy the increased demand in certified products.\u201dThe MSC outsources the certification process to accredited firms, and the cost is set by the third-party accreditor.The cost for certification, which would allow a fishery to brand itself with the MSC label, can be anywhere from US$15,000-US$120,000, according to the study. (A representative from MSC Canada could not confirm pricing information because it is not done by them.)With the cost being so high, and with an increased demand for a sustainable product, \u201ccapitalist globalization [has] led certification schemes to make unfounded claims in order to create accountability for themselves and hold onto their market position,\u201d the study reads.\u201cThis means that fisheries which can afford to apply for certification will have access to the label and not necessarily those which are fishing in the most sustainable way,\u201d study author Maria Hadjimicheal explained to Global News.She said she spoke to fisherman in Scotland who (at the time) could not afford to apply for certification even though they considered themselves very sustainable.They were \u201cfinding difficulties to sell their fish,\u201d because they weren\u2019t certified.The study also shows examples where a large-scale fishery certification process was contested by environmental groups (including the World Wildlife Fund), but was awarded the label anyway.MSC and labeling isn\u2019t all bad, Hadjimicheal clarifies, but\xa0she hopes the study furthers the debate on labels and sustainable seafood.\u201cThough I of course appreciate the at least short-term potential of such labels, particularly in today\u2019s globalized markets,\u201d she explained, \u201c [it means] that smaller producers / operators are thrown out of the game.\u201dMSC Canada representative Celine Rouzaud says the company is currently trying\xa0to make certification more accessible, including adding tools, funding and training initiatives.\u201cThe MSC [\u2026] is currently working on developing a simplified assessment process (again through an open consultation process) that is designed to bring improvements to help all fisheries access our program,\u201d she writes in an email to Global News.Despite any pitfalls, a representative from WWF Canada says the MSC certification is still considered \u201cbest in class\u201d of all wild-caught fisheries certification scheme.But that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t get better.\u201c[We are] committed to continued work with the MSC on improving their standard,\u201d Bettina Saier, fisheries expert at WWF, said.MSC Canada agrees.\u201cImproving the MSC program so that barriers felt by some fisheries can be overcome is a distinct, sincere intent of the MSC,\u201d she writes in an email to Global News.\u201cIt will take some time, but having only recently demonstrated the concept of a market-based seafood sustainability program, MSC can now work to significantly improve accessibility.\u201dAccording to statistics provided by MSC Canada, 41 Canadian fisheries are certified and four are currently in the process.

It\u2019s tempting to want a Nemo of your own, swimming around in a fish tank in your living room.Apparently, according to marine biologists, that lovely image is actually horrifying in reality: the world\u2019s population of clownfish \u2014 Nemo\u2019s orange-and-white species \u2014 has dwindled to the point where it has disappeared in some places where it formerly flourished. In others, its numbers are drastically lower than they were before 2003.University of Queensland PhD candidate Carmen da Silva, who attends the school of biological sciences, says that  after  was released.\u201cClownfish sales skyrocketed,\u201d da Silva told .\xa0\u201cI think a lot of people fell in love with the character Nemo and they wanted one for their aquarium.\xa0There\u2019s nothing wrong with owning a marine fish in an aquarium but I think a lot of people didn\u2019t realize 90 per cent of clownfish sold are taken from the wild.\u201dNow, the already threatened species is at the brink in many spots, even extinct in certain \u201ccollection locales\u201d in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and parts of the Great Barrier Reef.  claim, however, that the fall in numbers isn\u2019t that severe, and the legal farming for aquariums barely makes a dent in the overall population: the biggest impacts on the clownfish are from coral bleaching and warming sea temperatures.Despite that assurance, , a group dedicated solely to supplying aquarium stores with nursery-bred clownfish, is working overtime to help protect the species, especially with sequel  on the horizon in mid-June.\u201cThe surprising thing is that clownfish are actually very easy to breed in captivity,\u201d Saving Nemo director Karen Burke da Silva (no relation)  on the official site.\u201cClownfish are impacted by coral bleaching and warming sea temperatures\xa0because anemones become bleached in pretty much the same way as corals,\u201d she continued. \u201cThen there\u2019s new research that shows ocean acidification also affects clownfish larvae.\xa0It stops them from being able to smell an anemone, which they need to settle into once they become juveniles.\u201dSaving\xa0Nemo\u2019s initiative, called \u201c#FishKiss4Nemo,\u201d is asking social media audiences to make a \u201cfish kiss\u201d face and post it to whatever medium they want, using the hashtag. is to reach a million kisses, and have Ellen DeGeneres share her own kissy-face photo. As of this posting DeGeneres has not mentioned the campaign, but Saving Nemo is dedicated to getting her to join and eventually become the ambassador of the initiative.DeGeneres voices the lovable, forgetful Dory, who will be the star of the upcoming .So are blue tangs (Dory\u2019s species) as susceptible to harm as clownfish? They might be in an even tougher spot, since it is .\u201cBlue tangs are a fascinating species and they\u2019re gorgeous big fish to have in aquariums, but they release their eggs into the ocean,\u201d Burke da Silva said.\xa0\u201cClownfish glue their eggs down,\xa0but blue tang eggs are more complicated.\xa0First you\u2019d have to get a blue tang to spawn, and know when it spawned into the water, then collect those fertilized eggs and raise them in the right situation \u2014\xa0it\u2019s very difficult.\u201dFor now, biologists encourage people who insist on having aquarium fish to seek out sustainable, non-wild fish as pets.', u'Movie captures supernova remnant expanding at speeds up to 19,000 km/hWhen we look up at the stars or see stunning photographs of nebulae, they are snapshots in time. But a new movie from NASA is showing how stellar gases have been moving through space over the past 15 years.In 1572, a bright star lit up the sky, so bright that it could even be seen during the day. Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe would later write a book on the phenomenon, a supernova explosion.When a large star reaches the end of its life, it exhausts its nuclear fuel, collapses and then explodes.Another type of supernova occurs in a binary star system where a white dwarf star\xa0steals matter from the second star, accumulates too much material and explodes. This is\xa0what astronomers believed caused the supernova in 1572.That supernova ejected material that has been heated by resulting shock waves.\xa0Using data from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory from 200o to 2015, NASA has created the longest movie of the expanding gases, which is now called the Tycho supernova remnant.Astronomers have been measuring the speed of the shockwave and found that, though it looks relatively circular, different parts are moving at different speeds. They calculated the top speed at roughly 19,000 km/h.These types of supernovas, called Type Ia, help astronomers track the expansion\xa0of the universe.', u'IN PHOTOS: Rare Roman relics unearthed in Rome subway constructionIn a country as old as Italy, you never know what you\u2019ll find while digging beneath the streets of Rome.Workers upgrading Rome\u2019s subway system uncovered the ruins of a Roman barracks and much more earlier this month.The barracks were uncovered about nine metres below street level and cover about 900 square metres. Archaeologists said that the entire barracks consisted of 39 rooms.Rome\u2019s rich history has made digging and upgrading their subway system a bit of a challenge as they continually encounter ancient artifacts and ruins. The same situation occurred in Athens while the country prepared for the 2004 Olympics.Included are a long hallway, decorated floors and frescoed walls. Remains of about 13 adults were also uncovered along with a bronze bracelet and coin.\u201cIt\u2019s exceptional, not only for its good state of conservation\xa0but because it is part of a neighbourhood which already included\xa0four barracks,\u201d said Rossella Rea of the Culture Ministry. \u201cAnd\xa0therefore, we can characterize this area as a military\xa0neighbourhood.\u201d\u2014', u'IN PHOTOS: Israeli divers find trove of sunken treasureCAESAREA, Israel \u2013 Israeli archeologists say two divers have made the country\u2019s biggest discovery of Roman-era artifacts in three decades.The Roman-era treasures, discovered last month by divers Ran Feinstein and Ofer Raanan, were showcased for the first time Monday.The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) sent down its divers to investigate further and recover the precious Roman-era cargo, which includes bronze statues, lamps, jars, animal-shaped objects, anchors and thousands of coins featuring images of Roman emperors Constantine and Licinius.Jacob Sharvit, director of marine archaeology at the IAA, says some of the objects date back to the fourth century, while others are from the first and second century.Diver Ofer Raanan says \u201cIt was amazing, I dive here every other weekend and I never found anything like that ever.\u201d', u'David Saint-Jacques to be next Canadian astronaut in spaceOTTAWA \u2014 Quebec engineer and doctor David Saint-Jacques will be the next Canadian to work in space aboard the International Space Station.Saint-Jacques, 46, is scheduled to travel to space aboard the Russian Soyuz rocket for a six-month mission in November 2018.\u201cI promise to live up to your expectations,\u201d Saint-Jacques told a group of schoolchildren gathered Monday at an Ottawa museum, where Minister of Science and Innovation Navdeep Bains announced his assignment.Training for Saint-Jacques, who is a medical, engineering and astrophysics specialist, begins this summer in Canada, Russia, Japan and the United States.Saint-Jacques says he was inspired to be an astronaut by the many Canadians who preceded him.He\u2019ll become the ninth Canadian to travel to space, six of whom worked at the International Space Station. In all, Canadians have made 16 space flights to date.\u201cThese men and women have captured our imagination, motivated us to work and study harder, and inspired us to be our best,\u201d said Bains.Chris Hadfield, who was commander of the International Space Station in 2013, was the most recent Canadian in space.Last year, the federal government announced that two Canadian astronauts would be going to the space station by 2024 \u2013 one by 2019 and one by 2024 \u2013 but didn\u2019t specify who would be next.Saint-Jacques and Jeremy Hansen are only two active members of the Canadian Astronaut Corps.', u'Thousands of tiny red crabs stranded on California beachNEWPORT BEACH, Calif. \u2013 Thousands of tiny red crabs are carpeting beaches in Orange County and creating an amazing spectacle for swimmers and surfers.Lifeguards estimate that hundreds of thousands of the tiny crustaceans washed up Friday on beaches in Newport Beach.Others were spotted in Laguna Beach.The  that pelagic red crabs are usually found off Baja California, but currents that are part of the El Nino weather pattern are sweeping them north.The 1- to 3-inch-long crabs have washed up for several years along the Orange County coastline.Before that, they hadn\u2019t been seen in the area for decades.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Search these high-resolution satellite maps of the damageFort McMurray is still too dangerous, damaged and chaotic for anyone but emergency workers to even enter, the better part of a week after apocalyptic wildfires destroyed parts of the city and forced nearly 100,000 to flee with not much but the clothes on their backs.Over 2,400 homes and other buildings were destroyed, and more damaged by heavy smoke.Slowly, however, a detailed picture of the damage is emerging, as seen from space.Satellite images taken May 6 were released to Global News on Friday by , a Montreal-based geospatial information company.

But now, researchers have determined that not only do they use it to navigate, but they also take a snapshot for reference.While other animals, such as birds, are known to use the celestial heavens in their migration patterns or as a way of navigation, this is the first instance where researchers found that an insect or animal essentially takes a mental image and stores it in its memory.\u201cOther animals and insects also use the position of celestial bodies to navigate, but the dung beetles are unique \u2014 they are the only ones to take a snapshot where they gather information about how various celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon and stars, are positioned,\u201d said Basil el Jundi, researcher at Lund University in Sweden.The beetle takes the snapshot when it does a dance, storing the image in its brain and continuing to navigate in a straight line to its destination. This makes the beetle extremely efficient.The researchers from\xa0Lund University conducted experiments in South Africa. They used an artificial sky, changing the position of the celestial bodies and watched as the beetles oriented themselves.El Jundi said that he hopes to use the study to assist in improving navigation systems in driverless cars.', u'Animated graphic details spiralling global temperature changeIn the past century, our planet has warmed by about 1 C, due in large part to increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions in our atmosphere.

SpaceX reported a good splashdown, with three red-and-white striped parachutes slowing the final descent.The Dragon had been at the station for a month, dropping off supplies as well as an experimental, inflatable room that will pop open in two weeks. It was set free by the station\u2019s big robot arm.British astronaut Timothy Peake bid farewell to Dragon on behalf of the station\u2019s entire six-man crew.\u201cDragon spacecraft has served us well, and it\u2019s good to see it departing full of science,\u201d Peake radioed from 250 miles up. \u201cWe wish it a safe recovery back to Planet Earth.\u201dNearly 4,000 pounds of items fill the Dragon, including blood and urine samples from astronaut Scott Kelly\u2019s .

It\u2019s going to change our lives,\u201d CEO Rob Lloyd said a day earlier.\xa0It\u2019s real. It\u2019s happening now.\u201dExecutives with the Los Angeles-based company said the system could whisk people the 350 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 30 minutes.They described a future where there\u2019s no such thing as a long-distance relationship, and it doesn\u2019t matter where you live because the commute to work would be so quick.They say the tubes could run underground \u2013 a safe alternative to highway crossings and inclement weather.The propulsion technology involves levitating pods that use electricity and magnets to move through a low-friction environment at more than 700 mph.The idea was first articulated in a paper by Tesla co-founder Elon Musk in 2013. Musk was busy building his electric car and rooftop solar companies at the time, and offered the idea to whoever wanted to try it out.The idea has skeptics, including professor James Moore II, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Transportation Engineering Program.\t\t\t\n\t\tHe credited Musk for the new idea on how to move objects through tubes but said backers would face myriad public policy issues before it\u2019s installed on a large scale, including questions about safety, financing and land ownership.Such roadblocks are keeping self-driving vehicles off the road decades after the idea was born, he said.\u201cI would certainly not say nothing will come of hyperloop technology,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut I doubt this specific piece of technology will have a dramatic effect on how we move people and goods in the near term.\u201dHyperloop One hopes to start moving cargo by 2019 and people by 2021. It announced Tuesday that it had completed another $80 million round of financing and was partnering with firms including GE and SNCF, the French national railway company.Hyperloop One secured land in December in North Las Vegas to test the technology in a desert industrial park and will receive $9 million in state tax breaks for its investments in the state.Company officials hope to combine the separate components later this year for a test it\u2019s calling its \u201cKitty Hawk moment\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Wright Brothers\u2019 inaugural airplane flight.', u'\u2018Bizarre\u2019 star may not be so mysterious after allA \u201cbizarre\u201d star that had astronomers talking about alien civilizations might not be as strange as first thought., commonly referred to as \u201cTabby\u2019s star\u201d after the astronomer Tabetha Boyajian\xa0who studied the star\u2019s odd behaviour, puzzled astronomers when it was first called to their attention.Using data from the Kepler Space Telescope, citizen scientists analyzed the light curve of this star. Light curves are used to determine whether or not a planet orbits around a star. As a planet passes in front of a star \u2014 such as Mercury did on Monday \u2014 the light from the star dips ever so minutely.But what observers analyzing the data noticed from this somewhat average star was that it dipped by a lot. Instead of dipping somewhere near one\xa0per cent, it was closer to 20 per cent. As well, if a planet is orbiting a star, the dips would occur at regular intervals. However, this was not the case. Many catalogued it as \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cstrange.\u201dSome theories included a swarm of comets orbiting around the star, causing the large and irregular dips.However, another theory was that it was a large\xa0alien structure similar to something called a Dyson sphere.In the 1960s, Freeman Dyson theorized that alien civilizations will one day have need for a massive energy source. One of the most effective ways of obtaining such energy could result in the construction of a massive structure around a star \u2014 think of it as giant solar panels \u2014 that would gather all the star\u2019s energy output. This came to be known as the Dyson sphere or Dyson swarm. If one of these giant structures was observed from afar, the observer would see large dips in a star\u2019s brightness.Then, in January, a\xa0\xa0made the star even stranger: an astronomer found that between 1890 to 1989, the star dipped by 20 per cent. The star is an F-type, main sequence star. It is about one to one-and-a-half times the mass of our own sun and slightly hotter. A change of 20 per cent should take place over millions of years, not 100.But new data suggests that the star didn\u2019t dip at all during that time.Astronomers using the  analyzed more than 500,000 photographic glass plates by astronomers from 1885 to 1993. The new analysis found that in the 1960s other stars experienced similar drops in brightness. This, they concluded, suggests that the drop in Tabby\u2019s star, among others, was a result of a change in instrumentation.Still, even if there wasn\u2019t an actual 20 per cent dip in Tabby\u2019s star, considering the fact that it experiences irregular and often large dips in brightness over short intervals certainly makes this star one that needs further study. Though there\u2019s still hope out there that it is an alien civilization, the , an organization searching for intelligent alien life, hasn\u2019t found any indications of signals emanating from that region.', u'World\u2019s oldest axe found in AustraliaArchaeologists from the Australian National University and the University of Sydney made a surprising discovery when they found axe fragments that date back tens of thousands of years.The fragments were found in the Kimberly region of Western Australia and date back somewhere between 45,000 and 49,000 years ago, a time when the first humans arrived on the continent.The axe fragments were initially found in the early 1990s at a site at a shelter believed to be one of the oldest occupied by modern humans. But in 2014, an archaeology team re-examined a small fragment of a polished axe.The newly analyzed fragment is believed to have come from an axe that was shaped from basalt which was polished by grinding it on another rock. It likely came off the whole axe when it was being resharpened. The axe itself was likely carried off to be used elsewhere.\u201cPolished stone axes were crucial tools in hunter-gatherer societies and were once the defining characteristic of the Neolithic phase of human life. But when were axes invented? This question has been pursued for decades, since archaeologists discovered that in Australia axes were older than in many other places. Now we have a discovery that appears to answer the question,\u201d said the University of Sydney\u2019s Peter\xa0Hiscock, the lead author of the analysis.Archaeologists believe that the technology of axes was developed in Australia, as no other axes have been uncovered in islands to the north of Australia.', 'WATCH: NASA space telescope captures Mercury transitOn Monday, Mercury slipped quietly across the face of the sun. While telescopes here on Earth were turned toward the rare event, so were space telescopes.NASA released a beautiful video of the event as witnessed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a telescope that keeps a constant eye on the sun.The telescope captured the rare event using different filters that block out specific wavelengths.The whole transit, which took more than seven hours to complete, allowed astronomers and planetary scientists to study Mercury from afar, including its atmosphere and its motion through space.The next time Mercury will transit the sun will be on Nov. 11, 2019.', u'NASA finds 1,284 worlds orbiting stars outside our solar systemCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2013 The Milky Way just got a lot more crowded \u2013 with planets.NASA on Tuesday announced 1,284 new planets orbiting stars outside our solar system, called exoplanets. That\u2019s on top of the approximately 1,000 previously authenticated exoplanets detected by the Kepler Space Telescope since its launch in 2009.Scientists taking part in the news conference were ecstatic \u2013 it\u2019s the biggest planetary collection ever verified in a single swoop.\u201cOne of the great questions of all time, and one of NASA\u2019s science objectives in our journey to the solar system and beyond, is whether we are alone in the universe,\u201d said Paul Hertz, director of astrophysics for NASA. \u201cThe first step in answering this question is to detect and understand the population of planets around other stars.\u201dAccording to NASA, more than 3,200 exoplanets have now been confirmed, out of nearly 5,000 candidates discovered to date from all sources, including ground observatories. Kepler has accounted for the vast majority.The old process for confirming planets among the Kepler-identified candidates involved slow and laborious follow-up observations by ground telescopes.This new batch of planets comes from a statistical analysis led by Princeton University researcher Timothy Morton. And there are sure to be more \u2013 possibly as many as 1,327 more from among the Kepler-detected candidates listed in the telescope catalogue as of last July.Princeton\u2019s method \u2013 using a fast and automated software system called Vespa \u2013 puts the likelihood of true planethood for each confirmed planet at more than 99 per cent. Vespa relies on thousands of incoming signals from Kepler\u2019s candidate planets. A periodic dip in a star\u2019s brightness is the telescope\u2019s tip-off of a potential planet.The Princeton technique verified 984 previously confirmed planets spotted by Kepler, which spent four years peering continuously at 150,000 stars in a particular swath of sky. This new method also concluded that slightly more than 700 other candidate planets detected by Kepler are likely impostors, possibly small companion stars.Of the 1,284 newly verified planets, nearly 550 of them are thought to be Earth- or super Earth-sized and quite possibly rocky, according to NASA. This includes more than 100 new planets estimated to be 1.2 times the radius of Earth or smaller.Nine of these close-to-Earth-sized planets appear to orbit in the habitable zone of their stars. The tally for this Goldilocks zone of not too hot and not too cold, allowing for liquid water, now stands at 21 exoplanets following Tuesday\u2019s announcement.Natalie Batalha, Kepler mission scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, calls this exclusive list the \u201chall of fame.\u201dKepler is, by far, the keenest spy when it comes to exoplanets. It had a close call last month when it went into emergency mode, 75 million miles away. Flight controllers managed to resuscitate the craft.Mission manager Charlie Sobeck assured reporters Tuesday that the problem, while still unidentified, appears to have been transient and the telescope is performing just as well as before the episode. It\u2019s on an extended mission, having completed its primary objectives in 2012.NASA plans to launch another planet-hunter next year. Scientists said the Princeton method will be directly applicable to future missions as well.All this is going to change the way we see the universe, Batalha said.\u201cWhen you look up in the sky, you\u2019re not just going to see pinpoints of lights and see them as stars. You\u2019re going to see pinpoints of lights and see them as planetary systems,\u201d she said.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire: Will parts of city stay abandoned? Depends on oil pricesAbout\xa02,400 buildings were\xa0\xa0in Fort McMurray last week by devastating wildfires, officials said Monday.Will all of them be rebuilt, or will the northern Alberta city stay partly in ruins for years? It depends on oil prices, a University of Alberta urban planning professor explains.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that that would happen,\u201d Leith Deacon says. \u201cOf course, if oil stayed at $20 a barrel, and it\u2019s not financially feasible, then there would be trouble.\u201dAs Global News reporter Brian Hill last week, Fort McMurray homeowners who find themselves with badly damaged or destroyed houses face a stressful decision about what to do with their insurance claims.Typically, home insurance policies cover either the cost of a new house in the same location or compensation for the value of the house as it existed.With job losses in the oil patch that devastated Alberta\u2019s economy even before the fires, some families whose Fort McMurray homes are smoking ruins may cash the insurance cheque and move on. (A \xa0in April said that significant numbers of people were migrating from Alberta to B.C. in search of work.)Building a new house typically results in a larger payout, all other things being equal. But a new house in an isolated city\xa0with spiking unemployment may not be useful to a resident who was thinking of moving in search of work in any case. And if you were thinking of leaving anyway, a new house in Fort McMurray is only going to be worth what somebody is willing to pay for it.Real estate prices in Fort McMurray have fallen about 20 per cent over the last year, along with oil prices. Homeowners who bought at the top of the local market and had their homes incinerated\xa0at the bottom might have little or nothing left after paying off the bank, if they chose to walk away.\u201cA lot of these people, probably, have mortgages on their properties \u2014 it\u2019s not as simple as just cutting your ties,\u201d Deacon says. \u201cA lot of people who moved there probably paid very high values for the lots and the house.\u201dIt\u2019s a strong incentive to stay and rebuild \u2014 assuming there\u2019s a job.However, capital spending on oil and gas in Alberta this year is expected to be less than half of what it was in 2014,\xa0a released by Statistics Canada today reported.On the other hand, a rebuilding effort may stimulate an otherwise weak local economy.\u201cI understand that the price of oil currently is low, but unless something happens tomorrow that we suddenly don\u2019t need petroleum products, I think there\u2019s a future for Fort McMurray.\u201d\u201cIt might not rebuild as fast as it would have five years ago, when oil was at $100 a barrel, but I do think that what has happened will give them the opportunity to take a bit of a step back to figure out what is the best way to rebuild, and how you deal with the potential for future fires and the potential for future hard times.\u201dAs the wildfire situation in Fort McMurray, Alta., appeared to stabilize Sunday, insurance companies across Canada have already begun deploying mobile response units and are flying in personnel to the province from across the country to prepare to assess the damage.', u'Leopards losing ground in battle against extinction: studyLAGOS, Nigeria \u2013 Leopards have lost 75 per cent of their historic range across Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with three Asian subspecies in danger of eradication, a new study says.A three-year review of data published in the scientific journal PeerJ this week challenges the conventional assumption that the iconic and famously elusive spotted cats are thriving in the wild.It finds leopards have almost disappeared from vast ranges in China, Southeast Asia and the Arabian peninsula while African leopards confront mounting challenges in the north and west.The big cats are threatened by spreading farmlands, declining prey, conflict with livestock owners, trophy hunting and illegal trade in their skins and teeth. Their skins are sometimes worn as a symbol of power by African chiefs, including South Africa\u2019s President Jacob Zuma.Their rangelands have shrunk from 35 million square kilometres in 1750 \u2013 before the colonization of Africa and the spread of firearms \u2013 to about 8.5 million square kilometres, the study estimates.It will be used to update the endangered species list curated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, among several groups that conducted the study. Others include the National Geographic Society\u2019s Big Cats Initiative, the wild cat conservation organization Panthera and the Zoological Society of London.It is \u201cthe single most authoritative and exhaustive review of this kind,\u201d said Guillaume Chapron, associate professor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Science. Its findings are \u201ca shock as leopards were often believed to be more adaptable to human impacts \u2026 than other species such as tigers and lions.\u201d', u'How the Fort McMurray fire is creating its own weatherThe wildfires raging in Fort McMurray have been so intense, they\u2019ve created their own weather system.\u201cIt was creating its own high winds yesterday and even lightning was coming from the smoke clouds it created,\u201d Chad Morrison of\xa0Alberta Forestry told a briefing in Edmonton on Thursday.While it may seem incredible that a fire can create its own weather, it\u2019s not unusual. The same effects can be seen around volcanic eruptions.It works much in the same way any cloud forms. It\u2019s just extremely localized.Intense heat from the ground rises up, carries water vapour and \u2014 in the case of fires \u2014 ash, and forms a cloud, similar to the type\xa0of cloud you might see on a summer day. Those puffy cotton ball-like clouds are called cumulus. A cumulus cloud born out of fire is called a pyrocumulus cloud (\u201cpyro\u201d coming from Greek, which means fire).If convective forces \u2014 the transfer of heat at different altitudes \u2014 are strong enough, you might notice an anvil-shaped cloud. On normal stormy days, these clouds\xa0are\xa0called cumulonimbus. In the case of severe fires, they are\xa0called\xa0pyrocumulonimbus. These clouds can reach altitudes of about 30,000 feet or higher.Though they don\u2019t produce any significant rain, they can produce lightning, which, of course, can exacerbate the situation in wildfires.In a thunderstorm, particles of dust, rain, and sometimes even snow,\xa0can\xa0create an imbalance of electrical charges in the atmosphere.\xa0Positive charges gather at the top of a cloud, while negative charges gather at its base and spread out. But then positive charges build close to the ground as well. In order to fix this imbalance, a current passes between the two \u2014 lightning.\xa0The same can occur in the case of intense wildfires.As well as creating lightning, fires can produce high winds, as updrafts of wind (and downdrafts) occur.Both lightning and gusts of wind can make fighting these fires a challenge for crews trying to gain control of a blaze.', u'SpaceX launches satellite, lands rocket at sea for second timeCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2013 For the second month in a row, the aerospace upstart landed a rocket on an ocean platform early Friday, this time following the successful launch of a Japanese communications satellite.A live web broadcast showed the first-stage booster touching down vertically in the pre-dawn darkness atop a barge in the Atlantic, just off the Florida coast. The same thing occurred April 8 during a space station supply run for NASA. That was the first successful landing at sea for SpaceX, which expects to start reusing its unmanned Falcon rockets as early as this summer to save money and lower costs.Because of the high altitude needed for this mission, SpaceX did not expect a successful landing. But it was wrong. As the launch commentator happily declared, \u201cThe Falcon has landed.\u201dSpaceX founder and chief executive\xa0Elon Musk was even more exuberant.Musk said this was a three-engine burn for the booster\u2019s return, \u201cso triple deceleration from the last flight.\u201d Before liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida, he put the chances of a successful touchdown at \u201cmaybe even\u201d because the rocket was coming in faster and hotter than last time.Musk contends rocket reusability is key to shaving launch costs and making space more accessible.SpaceX is the only company to recover a rocket following an orbital launch. It achieved its first booster landing \u2014\xa0on solid ground at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station \u2014\xa0back in December. A landing at sea proved more elusive and required several tries., led by another wealthy high-tech entrepreneur, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, has landed and even reflown its booster rockets, but those did not put anything into orbit.Following last month\u2019s landing, Musk said he plans to refly that booster, possibly as soon as June. The first recovered booster, from December, will grace the entrance of SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.Already in the delivery business for NASA, SpaceX hopes to start transporting U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station by the end of next year in the company\u2019s next-generation Dragon capsules. But its ultimate goal is Mars.In a groundbreaking announcement last week, Musk said his company will attempt to send a Red Dragon to Mars in 2018 \u2014\xa0and actually land on the red planet. His ambition is to establish a human city on Mars.\xa0', u'What\u2019s killing off Chile\u2019s marine life?Thousands of sea creatures are washing ashore dead on Chile\u2019s Pacific beaches.Earlier this month, around 8,000 dead sardines washed up on the mouth of the Queule River. On the coast of Chiloe Island, it was thousands of dead clams.At the beginning of 2016, over 36,000 tonnes of salmon in Los Lagos washed up dead and 10,000 dead cuttlefish were found on the island of Santa Maria. In 2015, the bodies of more than 300 whales washed up on the remote beaches in the south of Chile.But scientists aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s killing the animals.Marine biologists in the region say a possible cause is the increase of algae due to El Nino. The \u201cred tide\u201d of algae kills other species by \u201cconsuming oxygen in the water or filling it with toxins,\u201d .\u201cWe have red tides every year in southern Chile, but this time it reached further north,\u201d Jorge Navarro, a researcher at the marine institute IDEAL, told AFP.\u201cIt affected bivalve populations (such as clams) that had never before been exposed like this.\u201dThe algae may come every year, but the warmer water from this year\u2019s record-breaking  means it\u2019s coming in quantities higher than before.Another reason for the deaths could be human-made fish farms.Laura Farias, an oceanographer at Concepcion University, told AFP that there\u2019s \u201cno ecological, oceanographic or climatic explanation\u201d linking the whales\u2019 death in 2015 to the other mass deaths.\u201cThere are studies indicating that in Patagonia the greater occurrence of toxic blooms could be a consequence of aquaculture,\u201d she said.Chilean fishermen staged a protest demanding better government compensation after the fish started washing up dead.Chile is especially vulnerable to the effects of the ocean because of its large coastline, which spans over 4,000 kilometres.It\u2019s the second largest producer of salmon in the world, according to AFP. The amount of dead fish found in Los Lagos is equal to around 12 per cent of their annual production.Chilean authorities have banned fishing in the region, and declared it an emergency zone.The economic impact of the die-off on local fishing operations has yet to be determined but the emergency decree signed by President Michelle Bachelet is designed to subsidise the local population until the algae is gone.But fishermen in the area say the US$150 offered by Bachelet isn\u2019t enough to cover the basic needs after their livelihoods were put at risk.The fishermen blocked roads and set up flaming barricades in several cities in Chile\u2019s south this week to pressure her to provide more. They also blocked boat access from the mainland to the Chiloe archipelago.About 6,500 fishermen are in line for payments.', u'Before and after: Wildfire engulfs Fort McMurray\t\tBefore-and-after satellite images show fire-ravaged Fort McMurray engulfed in smoke Wednesday as over 80,000 residents fled and 1,600 homes were destroyed.The space\xa0image was taken Wednesday by\xa0, a subsidiary of Google that operates satellites.

(For a high-resolution image, click .)In the image, the fires are the brightest parts, while the light grey represents the smoke from the fires.The high winds, which appear to be blowing south-southeast of the blaze, exacerbated the fire on Tuesday and Wednesday forcing the city to issue a mandatory evacuation order.', u'Genetically modified mosquitoes to help fight the spread of Zika virusMIAMI \u2013 British biotech company Oxitec and the Cayman Islands government announced plans Thursday to release millions of genetically modified mosquitoes in the fight against a species that spreads and other diseases.Deployment of the mosquitoes against the Aedes aegypti species in the Cayman Islands is a major advance for Oxitec, which has promoted the method heavily as an environmentally safe way to combat the vectors of mosquito-borne illnesses while confronting public concerns about the technology.The company has deployed its mosquitoes to fight Zika in Brazil following initial trials there and previously conducted tests in the Cayman Islands and Panama. Oxitec and officials in the Florida Keys have proposed testing there as well and are awaiting U.S. regulatory approval.The Cayman government approved the full deployment after what they called a successful, peer-reviewed trial in 2010, Bill Petrie, the director of the British territory\u2019s Mosquito Research and Control Unit, said in a statement.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u201cWe have wanted to remove this invasive pest for a long time but this has proven very difficult using currently available tools on an island the size of Grand Cayman, so we have been looking for new approaches,\u201d Petrie said.Male mosquitoes don\u2019t bite. The company says its modified males will mate with females and produce offspring that will not survive to adulthood, which should dramatically reduce the population of the non-native, disease-spreading Aedes aegypti species in the territory.Oxitec will begin releasing hundreds of thousands of modified mosquitoes per week on the island of Grand Cayman, home to about 50,000 people, starting in June and continue for at least nine months, said Glen Slade, the company\u2019s head of business development.The mosquitoes will not be used on the two smaller islands of the British territory, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, which do not have the Aedes aegypti. The company insists it\u2019s not possible for the mosquitoes to fly to other islands or to survive long in the environment if they were to be inadvertently transferred elsewhere. They predict a massive drop in the number of the targeted species on Grand Cayman.The company has started outreach on Grand Cayman to address any public concerns. In Key West, Florida, public meetings about Oxitec\u2019s proposed trial there became so contentious that mosquito control officials requested law enforcement protection at an April meeting to discuss the issue.Phil Goodman, chairman of the five-member Florida Keys Mosquito Control District board of commissioners, said the decision to use Oxitec\u2019s mosquitoes on Grand Cayman was good news for the prospects of a similar trial in Florida if it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\u201cIf everything continues to look good with this and we do get approval and the citizens agree to this, it\u2019s what would work here in the Keys,\u201d he said.In February, the World Health Organization said it is encouraging countries to conduct further trials of genetically modified mosquitoes to help tackle emerging illnesses such as Zika. The virus has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly and to a temporary paralysis condition known as Guillain-Barre.\xa0', u'Fort McMurray fire interactive map: NASA data shows fire invading town (Updated)Satellite data released today by NASA paints a detailed and sinister portrait of wildfires closing in on Fort McMurray early this morning.The NASA shows the wildfire closing in on Fort McMurray from the south and west,\xa0invading the Abasand, Beacon Hill and Waterways neighbourhoods. (Updated May 6.)\xa0Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said roughly 1,600 structures in Fort McMurray have destroyed or damaged by a\xa0wildfire that raged through Fort McMurray Tuesday night, Global News .In a news conference Wednesday morning, Notley said depending on the wind, the fire likely will spread into the Thickwood and Timberlea neighbourhoods. The fire is expected to be even worse than on Tuesday, thanks to a third day of high temperatures and low humidity. The current size is between 7,500 and 10,000 hectares.About 88,000 people have fled the fire.\xa0Click on any point in the interactive map below\xa0for details.

NASA gathers data on wildfires across the world through a system of Chad Morrison, Senior Manager of Wildfire Prevention with the Government of Alberta, says the wildfire in and near Fort McMurray is expected to be even worse Wednesday than it was Tuesday, when it swept into the Alberta community and laid waste to multiple neighbourhoods.', u'Earth\u2019s lightning capital: NASA data points to this South American lakeNew NASA data has concluded that the lightning capital of Earth is Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, knocking Africa\u2019s Congo Basin from the top spot.The researchers used satellite data from the past 16 years, finding that Lake Maracaibo receives an average rate of 233 lightning flashes per square kilometre each year.The high lightning activity at Lake Maracaibo isn\u2019t new to scientists: it is the largest lake in South America\xa0and, together with the breezes from nearby mountains, it helps to create plenty of thunderstorms annually \u2014 297 nighttime storms on average, with September being the peak month.It may seem hard to imagine, but each second there are about 100 lightning strikes across the globe, with each bolt producing about one billion volts of electricity.Though the Congo Basin didn\u2019t take the No. 1\xa0position, Africa as a whole is the top continent for the most lightning hot spots, holding six of the top 10.In Canada, the lightning capital is Windsor, Ont.', u'Fort McMurray wildfire and the smoke-trapping inversion which made the fire look calmFort McMurray residents, all 70,000 of them, were  threatening\xa0the northeastern Alberta community.But to many on Tuesday morning, it appeared\xa0the fires had died down from Monday night. Fire officials, however, warned it was largely an illusion due to an inversion.\t\t\u201cWe wake up this morning and we don\u2019t see anything. And people think it\u2019s fine and it\u2019s all gone away\u2026 Don\u2019t get into a false sense of security,\u201dwarned Regional Fire Chief of Wood Buffalo Darby Allen.A few hours later, what Fort McMurray-area residents saw when they peered out the window\xa0quickly changed. The inversion had broken, allowing the smoke trapped close to the ground to rise, revealing a resurgent fire.Generally, nights and mornings are cool, along with the surface of the earth. And often, warmer air is sitting on top of that cooler air that\u2019s close to the ground, acting much like a lid.\u201cAs you go up in the atmosphere from the surface, temperatures usually decrease with height,\u201d says Mike Flannigan, University of Alberta professor\xa0and .\u201cBut at times temperatures increase with height above ground, and that\u2019s called an inversion because it\u2019s inverted from the normal position of it being cooler as you go higher.\u201dThis is common; and\xa0as the day heats up the surface of the earth warms and the inversion disappears.A recent heat wave has brought scorching temperatures to the region, with thermostats reaching a high of 32 C Tuesday.Inversions also keep strong winds from reaching\xa0to the earth\u2019s surface, but once it breaks the gusty winds sweep through.\u201cOnce the inversion breaks down then you get these stronger winds from above the earth\u2019s surface coming down to the earth\u2019s surface, coming down to the head of the fire,\u201d Flannigan says.Inversions happen almost every day, especially where there is a high-pressure system. When there\u2019s rain or wind they are less common.\u201cIn spring in Alberta, just about every day there will be an inversion. That\u2019s fairly normal.\u201dThe hot weather is expected to stick around in Alberta.Global News meteorologist Anthony Farnell says the conditions in Fort McMurray have contributed to the raging fire. He says\xa0humidity dropped to just 15 per cent by late afternoon as temperatures soared to a record-breaking highs.\u201cFirefighters use this 30-30-30 rule. It involves temperature, humidity and wind speed. When they\u2019re all around 30, it\u2019s bad news,\u201d Farnell says. \u201cThat is what we have seen throughout the day today.\u201dThe forecast may only worsen Wednesday, with no rain in sight, even stronger winds and temperatures predicted to remain above 30 C.\u201cThis is going to be a rough 48 hours coming up,\u201d Farnell says.', u'WATCH: Bizarre glowing jellyfish discovered in Mariana TrenchIt looks like something out of this world, but its home is right here on Earth, in the Pacific Ocean.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) , which is exploring the depths of the Mariana Trench, encountered a\xa0strange-looking jellyfish \xa0on one of its expeditions.The rover made the discovery at the Enigma Seamount, at a depth of 3,700 metres. The Mariana Trench is home to the deepest point on Earth at 11\xa0kilometres, called the Challenger Deep.NOAA believes the new glowing jellyfish to be a\xa0hydromedusa as belonging to the Crossota genus.The jellyfish\u2019s position at the beginning of the video, where its long tentacles are extended outward and motionless, suggests that it is in \u201cambush predation mode,\u201d NOAA said of the video.', u'Nano-machines: Scientists develop engine smaller than an antIt may sound like something out of a science-fiction movie, but researchers have developed an engine that is just a few billionths of a metre in size.Researchers at Cambridge University have created the prototype that uses light as a source of power, as well as gold. Such miniscule machines are called \u201cnano-machines.\u201dThe engines the researchers developed are comprised\xa0of charged particles of gold, which are then bound together using a water-laden type of gel. The nano-engine is then heated with a laser (the light source), releasing stored energy in a\xa0fraction of a second. When this occurs, the coatings lose all their water, making the nano-particles of gold bind together in clusters.After\xa0the gold is clumped together, it is then cooled, which releases the water, pushing the gold particles apart.\u201cIt\u2019s like an explosion,\u201d said Tao Ding from Cambridge\u2019s Cavendish Laboratory, the paper\u2019s primary\xa0author. \u201cWe have hundreds of gold balls flying apart in a millionth of a second when water molecules inflate the polymers around them.\u201dWhile the process may sound complicated, it\u2019s actually considered a simple process, an energy-efficient one and one that is bio-compatible. This bio-compatibility means that the tiny engines\xa0can possibly be inserted into living human cells to combat diseases.', u'Diver William Trubridge sets world free-diving recordNew Zealander William Trubridge has pushed the limits of the human body after he broke his own diving record.On April 30, 35-year-old Trubridge plunged 122 metres below the beautiful blue waters off\xa0the Bahamas, beating his old record of 121 metres in front of a crowd of supporters including his family.He didn\u2019t do it with a scuba tank, but instead he did something called free-diving, where trained professionals test the boundaries of their bodies by just taking a deep breath of air and diving. Trubridge held his breath for four\xa0minutes and 24 seconds.And it was no easy feat for Trubridge.\u201cThe dive itself was pretty difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a beautiful descent \u2026 But then at the bottom, I took my tag, tried to attach it to the Velcro on my leg, and for some reason, it wouldn\u2019t attach.\u201dLosing valuable seconds, he finally managed to attach the tag. But by then, he was \u201cout of the head-space that I need to be in for a deep dive.\u201d\u201cAt one point, I didn\u2019t even know if I\u2019d make it to my safety divers.\u201dHe made his way up the rope, surfacing. And then once his record was confirmed, the crowd erupted in cheers.Diving is more of a physical challenge than most people may realize. Our bodies are made to breathe air and at a particular pressure. The deeper we go (even the higher we go), the bigger the difference in pressure around our bodies. If\xa0optimum\xa0pressurization isn\u2019t maintained, it will kill you.And the the sport  killed divers. In 2013, Nicholas Mevoli died after diving to a depth of 72 metres. In 2015, Russian diver  \u2014 who held more than 40 world free-diving records \u2014 plunged into the depths of the Mediterranean near the island of Ibiza, and never resurfaced.According to , in a study from 2006 to 2011, there were a total of 417 free-diving accidents, with 308 of them being fatal.', u'Scientists discover 3 Earth-sized planets that might support lifeCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2013 Astronomers searching for life beyond our solar system may need to look no farther than a little, feeble nearby star.A Belgian-led team reported Monday that it\u2019s discovered three Earth-sized planets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star less than 40 light-years away. It\u2019s the first time planets have been found around this type of star \u2013 and it opens up new, rich territory in the search for extraterrestrial life.Because this star is so close and so faint, astronomers can study the atmospheres of these three temperate exoplanets and, eventually, hunt for signs of possible life. They\u2019re already making atmospheric observations, in fact, using NASA\u2019s Spitzer Space Telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope will join in next week.Altogether, it\u2019s a \u201cwinning combination\u201d for seeking chemical traces of life outside our solar system, said Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Julien de Wit, a co-author of the study, released by the journal Nature.The star in question \u2013 named Trappist-1 after the Belgian telescope in Chile that made the discovery \u2013 is barely the size of Jupiter and located in the constellation Aquarius.Other exoplanet searches have targeted bigger, brighter stars more like our sun, but the starlight in these cases can be so bright that it washes out the signatures of planets. By comparison, cool dwarf stars that emit infrared light, like Trappist-1, make it easier to spot potential worlds.University of Liege astronomers in Belgium \u2013 lead study authors Michael Gillon and Emmanuel Jehin \u2013 built the Trappist telescope to observe 60 of the nearest ultra-cool dwarf stars. The risky effort paid off, de Wit noted in an email.\u201cSystems around these tiny stars are the only places where we can detect life on an Earth-sized exoplanet with our current technology,\u201d Gillon said in a statement. \u201cSo if we want to find life elsewhere in the universe, this is where we should start to look.\u201dThe two inner exoplanets take between 1.5 and 2.4 days to orbit the Trappist-1 star. The precise orbit time of the third planet is not known, but it falls somewhere between 4.5 days and 73 days. That puts the planets 20 times to 100 times closer to their star than Earth is to our sun, Gillon noted. The setup is more similar in scale to Jupiter\u2019s moons than to our solar system, he added.Although the two innermost planets are very close to the star, it showers them with only a few times the amount of energy that Earth receives from our own sun. The third exoplanet farther out may receive significantly less of such radiation than Earth does.The astronomers speculate the two inner exoplanets may have pockets where life may exist, while the third exoplanet actually might fall within the habitable zone \u2013 real estate located at just the right distance from a star in order to harbour water and, possibly, life.Spitzer and Hubble should answer whether the exoplanets have large and clear atmospheres, according to de Wit. They also might be able to detect water and methane, if molecules are present.Future observatories, including NASA\u2019s James Web Space Telescope set to launch in 2018, should unearth even more details.Gillon and his colleagues identified the three exoplanets by observing regular dips in the infrared signals emanating from the Trappist-1 star, some 36 light-years away. A single light-year represents about 6 trillion miles.The astronomers conducted the survey last year using the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope, or Trappist. It\u2019s considered a prototype for a more expansive European project that will widen the search for potentially habitable worlds to 500 ultra-cool stars. This upcoming project is dubbed Speculoos \u2013 short for Search for Habitable Planets Eclipsing Ultra-Cool Stars.', u'Do you hug your dog? Study suggests they aren\u2019t feeling the lovePeople who love cuddling with dogs may be in for a rude awakening.New research  earlier this month by University of British Columbia professor Dr. Stanley\xa0Coren, suggests hugs from humans stress dogs out.\u201cI can summarize the data quite simply by saying that the results indicated that the Internet contains many pictures of happy people hugging what appear to be unhappy dogs,\u201d Coren wrote.Coren said he looked at over 250 pictures of people hugging dogs (randomly selected) from the internet to determine how many of them enjoyed snuggling up with their owners.Four out of five dogs were uncomfortable or showed signs of anxiety, he said.And out of all the pictures, only 7.6 per cent looked happy while being hugged.The others were \u201cshowing neutral or ambiguous responses.\u201dBut what surprised him the most was the type of pictures he was looking at: people who wanted to \u201cshow how much they cared for and shared a bond with their pet.\u201d\u201cThe people \u2026 probably chose photos in which they felt that both the person and the dog looked happiest.\u201dThat means most people, especially children, aren\u2019t able to tell when their dog is uncomfortable.Next time your pull man\u2019s best friend in for a cuddle, Coren says you can check to see whether your dog is feeling the love by looking for a few common signs.\u201cThe most common sign of anxiety is when the dog turns his head away from whatever is bothering or worrying him, sometimes also closing his eyes.\u201dSeeing the whites of a dog\u2019s eyes around the rim of their eyelid, called \u201chalf-moon eye,\u201d is another indicator.Other signs could be if a dog licks its lips, yawns, or slicks its ears back.If your pet does any of these things, Coren recommends you \u201csave your hugs for your two-footed family members and lovers.\u201d', u'Astro Corner: What\u2019s up in the May skyThis month we get treated to Eta Aquarid meteor shower.Though the best spot for this shower is in the southern tropics (as the radiant, or area in the sky from which they seem to appear will be higher in the sky), we can still expect to see about 10 to 30 meteors per hour.If you want to catch them for yourself, \xa0you can just grab a blanket, dress warmly, and lie on the grass. However, the best time is just before dawn, so don\u2019t be too disappointed if you don\u2019t see very many during the night.The peak occurs on the night of May 6 to 7. The good news is that the moon will only just be coming out of its new phase, so the sky will be dark to catch even faint meteors.When a planet passes in front of the sun (or a moon passes in front of a planet), astronomers call it\xa0a transit. On May 9, Mercury, the first planet out from the sun, will transit the sun.From our perspective here on Earth, only two planets can ever pass in front of the sun: Mercury and Venus. The last time we had a transit of Venus was in 2012. The next transit will be in 2117.While transits of Venus are rare (they occur once every eight years and then don\u2019t occur for another 105), that\u2019s not the case for Mercury.The last time Mercury dotted the sun was in 2006 and the next one will occur in 2019.Jupiter, the mighty king of the solar system, has been gracing our sky\xa0for the past few months. You can easily spot it as the brightest object in the night sky.On this night, you\u2019ll be able to spot the moon, a waxing gibbous (a moon is waxing when it\u2019s headed towards its full phase; it\u2019s waning when it\u2019s headed towards its new phase), together with Jupiter.The pair actually rise in the daylight hours, around 2 p.m.\xa0So when the sun sets, they will be high in the southern sky.This month\u2019s full moon has a lot of company.On this night, \xa0you can spot the moon, Saturn, Mars and the bright red star Antares.You can find them in the southeastern\xa0sky around 11 p.m. Saturn will lie southwest of the moon, while Mars will lie to the southeast. The red supergiant star, Antares, part of the summer constellation of Scorpius, will lie south of the moon.No, it won\u2019t appear as \xa0(nor will it ever).On May 30, Mars will be about 75.3 million kilometres from Earth.\xa0This happens because both planets don\u2019t have perfectly circular orbits. Instead, they are elliptical, bringing the pair close together and farther apart at times.You may\xa0even notice a rise in the planet\u2019s brightness from May 18 to June\xa03. By the middle of June Mars will become a bit fainter as our two planets move away from each other.Mars makes its closest approach once every 26 months. The\xa0next one will be on July 31, 2018.In 2003, Mars\xa0made the\xa0closest approach to Earth in 60,000 years. The next time that happens will be 2287.Check back next month for what\u2019s up in the June sky.', u'Large Hadron Collider taken offline by a weaselIt may be the world\u2019s most powerful particle accelerator, but it\u2019s no match for a weasel.The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in the countryside just outside of Geneva, Switzerland, was taken offline Thursday evening after a weasel chewed through some wiring.A slide presentation that was \xa0by CERN said the culprit was a \u201cfouine,\u201d which is\xa0a beech marten. Martens are part of the weasel family.The accelerator, which is an underground 27-kilometre ring, will be offline for the next few days until they can conduct repairs.The elusive Higgs Boson particle \u2014 which\xa0explains what gives all matter in our universe mass \u2014 was created and observed at the LHC in 2012.According to authorities, there was\xa0very little left of the weasel.', u'SFU professor creates water from thin airSFU professor  has created a machine that turns air into water.\u201cPeople are really struggling with water so water has become a major issue,\u201d says Bahrami, who explains the prototype took three years to create after\xa0years of research.Unlike air conditioners, which can also similarly create condensation, he explains this prototype can create water under any weather conditions.The prototype works by enhancing the humidity in the air, and it can create between 19 to 40 liters a day.He explains he built it with a goal in mind: to make drinking water more available to those who need it the most.\u201cThere is no secret that water has become a scarce commodity, especially fresh water,\u201d he adds.He says this is not only true in places like North Africa, but also in the Canadian prairies that suffer from water shortages.Bahrami says the technology is scalable, and in the future, machines can be as small as a coffee maker or as large as necessary.He explains a few large corporations have approached him about his invention, but he says his main goal is to give this technology to the people who need it the most.\u201cI personally think we need to focus more on the humanitarian and sustainable aspect of it.\u201dSo what\u2019s next? He says his next project involves solar energy to help reduce electricity consumption.', u'Explore Mars in this 360\xb0 view from Curiosity roverIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like standing on Mars, is giving you the opportunity.The space agency released another 360\xb0 view of Mars as seen from the perspective of the Curiosity rover. But you get to control this new view yourself.(Click for a link to another panoramic mosaic you can zoom into and explore.)While we often think of Mars as being dusty, it is also very rocky, which can be hazardous for a vehicle trundling around. And the Curiosity rover has just completed the most dangerous trip it has had since being on the surface.Naukluft Plateau is covered in sandstone bedrock. Eons of wind erosion has created ridges with rough protrusions, making Curiosity\u2019s voyage a tricky one. The wheels on the rover are constructed of aluminum and have already shown signs of wear and tear. In 2013, the Curiosity rover team began adjusting the rover\u2019s route in order to reduce the chances of more damage.So what are you looking at in the panorama?First, there are the rocks of\xa0Naukluft Plateau. As Curiosity is currently in a crater \u2014 Gale Crater \u2014 you can also see the rim in the distance. And Mount Sharp,\xa0Curiosity\u2019s long-term scientific research station, which lies in the centre of the crater, is the towering mountain in the distance.Since arriving in 2012, Curiosity has travelled\xa012.7 km. It will now travel another 7.5 km to explore other sites of scientific interest.', u'Ravens as smart as chimps, despite smaller brain: studyA new study out of Sweden has found that, despite their smaller brains, ravens are just as smart as chimpanzees.One method of measuring intelligence is to observe whether animals can choose rational behaviour over animal impulses, called inhibitory control.A large-scale study by Duke University on this type of behaviour was done in 2014 on 36 different species of animals, with most being primates or apes. The researchers placed food in a transparent tube that had openings on either side. The animals were to get the food using either of the openings rather than go to it directly. The result of the study found\xa0that apes performed best and seemed to suggest that brain size mattered.The researchers out of Lund University in Sweden applied the same test to birds. They first trained the birds using an opaque tube and then transitioned to the transparent one. In the test, the ravens chose to get to the food by the side openings every time. Crows and jackdaws did so almost every time.\u201cThere is still so much we need to understand and learn about the relationship between intelligence and brain size, as well as the structure of a bird\u2019s brain, but this study clearly shows that bird brains are not simply birdbrains after all,\u201d said Can Kabadayi, one of the researchers.', u'SpaceX plans to send \u2018Red Dragon\u2019 capsule to Mars in 2018CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2013 SpaceX is shooting for Mars.The company\u2019s billionaire founder and chief executive Elon Musk announced Wednesday via Twitter that he plans to send a Dragon capsule to land on the red planet as early as 2018.The Mars spacecraft will be called Red Dragon, Musk said. No astronauts will accompany Red Dragon on this first test flight. Musk said he wouldn\u2019t recommend transporting crews in Dragons beyond the moon; its internal volume is only about the size of an SUV.California-based SpaceX already is using Dragons for space station supply runs, and the company could start transporting Americans to the International Space Station by the end of next year.Musk said the upgraded Dragon is designed to land anywhere in the solar system.', u'Transit of Mercury: How to see the May 9 event across CanadaOn May 9, the smallest and closest planet to the sun, Mercury, will slide across the face of the sun.\xa0And you can see it for yourself.From our perspective here on Earth, we can see only two planets cross the face of the sun: Mercury and Venus (as they are the two most inner planets from our vantage point).When a planet passes in front of a star (or even a moon crosses in front of a planet), it\u2019s called a transit (this is also one of the\xa0methods astronomers use to find planets orbiting other stars).The transit of Venus seen on June 6, 2012 in Tel Aviv.While transits of Venus are quite rare (they occur once every eight years and then don\u2019t occur for another 105), that\u2019s not the case for Mercury. There are about 13 transits every 100 years for the tiny planet. The last time Mercury dotted the sun was in 2006; the next time will be be\xa0in 2019.This year, Canada is in a prime location to\xa0catch the Mercury transit.From the coast of British Columbia to roughly Regina, Sask., the transit will have already begun when the sun rises. But east of there, the entire event \u2014 which takes more than seven hours \u2014will be visible.It\u2019s important to remember that you\xa0should never look at the sun directly.\xa0But here are some ways you can watch the transit for yourself.In order to see the tiny black disk of Mercury against the bright backdrop of the sun, you\u2019ll need to look through a telescope with a special filter. Fortunately there are organizations around the country that have set up events with these types of telescopes.You can watch the transit of Mercury\xa0in  at the , beginning at 7 a.m.In , you can see it\xa0at several places. The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) will hold\xa0events at the\xa0\xa0and\xa0the  (in Richmond Hill) from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. You can also catch it at  from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.In ,  will also hold an event from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.In , you can watch it at the \xa0beginning at 6 a.m.In Sechelt,\xa0, the  will have its observatory open for the transit, after the sun rises at 5:30 a.m.Check your local science centres and astronomical groups for other events near you.If you\u2019re unable to attend an event (or there isn\u2019t one) near you, there\u2019s always the internet.Both\xa0\xa0and\xa0 will broadcast\xa0the transit beginning at 7 a.m. ET.Fingers crossed that the weather co-operates. It is quite interesting to see such a tiny planet, 100 million km away, in such an unusual way.', u'Bees highly threatened by mites, viruses, study findsScientists have been attempting to ascertain\xa0why there has been a decline in bee populations around the world. Now a new study has concluded that viruses and mites might be playing a larger part than once believed.A five-year study across the United States by the University of Maryland and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has revealed a disturbing trend: the prevalence and increase in deadly bee mites and viruses.It\u2019s been known that the varroa mite has been threatening bees for some time, however, this new study concludes that it might be worse than once estimated.The study surveyed beekeepers from across 41 states and the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam from 2009 to 2014, and focused on two major parasites: the varroa mite and nosema.Interestingly, the varroa mite was reported less in migratory beekeepers, those that\xa0take their hives on the road to pollinate various crops. But for the nosema, the reverse was true: stationary beekeepers reported a lower incidence compared to migratory beekeepers.\u201cWe knew that varroa was a problem, but it seems to be an even bigger problem than we first thought,\u201d said study co-author Dennis vanEngelsdorp, an assistant professor of entomology at the University of Maryland. \u201cMoreover, varroa\u2019s ability to spread viruses presents a more dire situation than we suspected.\u201dOne of the most disconcerting discoveries was that more than 50 per cent of beekeepers reported high infestations of varroa mites at the start of winter when colonies are producing long-lived winter bees that need to survive on stored honey and pollen.Another disturbing discovery is that the chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) that can kill bees within days has skyrocketed. When it was first detected in 2010, fewer than one per cent of bee samples tested positive. Now, just four years later, that number has nearly doubled each year and currently sits at 16 per cent.The researchers plan on also studying the effects of pesticides on bees. Studies have found that neonicotinoids, a group of pesticides used almost exclusively\xa0on corn as well as on other crops, is threatening bees around the world.\u201cOur next step is to provide a similar baseline assessment for the effects of pesticides,\u201d vanEngelsdorp said. \u201cWe have multiple years of data and as soon as we\u2019ve finished the analyses, we\u2019ll be ready to tell that part of the story as well.\u201d', u'Hubble discovers moon around dwarf planet MakemakeAstronomers using the  have found a moon orbiting the dwarf planet Makemake, far beyond the orbit of Neptune.Makemake lies within the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy objects left over from the formation of our solar system, the same region where Pluto lies. It\u2019s believed that hundreds of thousands of these objects exist in the region, and possibly a trillion comets or more.The moon \u2014 designated MK2 \u2014 is about 160 kilometres across and lies about 21,000 kilometres\xa0from Makemake. It is also more than 1,300 times fainter than the small world it orbits.The moon was discovered through\xa0observations using Hubble\u2019s Wide Field Camera 3 in April 2015, but was only announced on Tuesday.There\xa0are four dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt (a fifth dwarf planet, Ceres, lies within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter), and some have moons. However, this is the first moon discovered around Makemake.Astronomers made previous attempts\xa0to discover whether or not Makemake had a moon, but never found one. They believe that the orbit of the moon is edge-on to the planet, making it difficult to see due to the glare of the planet.Makemake was discovered in 2005 at the Palomar Observatory and named after a god of creation of the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island.', u'WATCH: Powerful solar flare seen in spectacular high-definitionThey are one of the most powerful eruptions on the surface of the sun, and on April 17, NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory captured one in 4K.Solar flares originate from sunspots. These much cooler parts of the sun have complex magnetic fields. Think of the sun\u2019s magnetic field like a looped rubber band. One end represents the south pole; the other,\xa0the north. As the sun rotates, the magnetic loops wrap tighter and tighter, making them twist like an elastic band. Suddenly the stored energy releases in the sunspot area and \u2013 bam! \u2013 you have a solar flare.The strength of solar flares are measured on a scale from weakest to\xa0strongest : C, M and X. Each letter is a 10-fold increase in energy output.The April 17 solar flare was an M6.7.', u'Alberta meningitis death trial shines light on natural medicineCALGARY \u2013 Experts say it\u2019s faith in all things natural combined with a distrust of science and possibly authority that leads some to bypass the medical system \u2014 even to the point where they put themselves or their children at risk.\u201cIt\u2019s like a religion to them,\u201d says , research director of the University of Alberta\u2019s Health Law and Science Policy Group. He has written the books \u201cThe Cure for Everything! Untangling the Twisted Messages about Health, Fitness and Happiness\u201d and \u201cIs Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?\u201d\u201cStudies have shown that some people are more likely to believe these kinds of things.A trial in Lethbridge, Alta., has shone a light upon the reliance on natural medicine and the question of when medical attention should be sought for a sick child. are charged with failing to provide the necessaries of life after treating their 19-month-old sick son, Ezekiel, with smoothies containing hot peppers, onions and horseradish.Court heard how the boy swung between illness and recovery for days in March 2012 before a family friend and nurse suggested the child could be suffering from viral meningitis and should see a doctor.The mother opted to visit a naturopath instead. By that time, the toddler was so stiff he couldn\u2019t sit in his car seat. Later that day, Ezekiel stopped breathing and was rushed to hospital. The medical examiner ruled he died of bacterial meningitis.University of Calgary bioethicist Juliet Guichon says it\u2019s not uncommon for parents to discount medical advice.\u201cThere\u2019s an element of irrationality in the rejection of physician advice. If physicians are telling people things they don\u2019t want to hear, then it\u2019s hard for the patient and the family to accept what they\u2019re being told,\u201d Guichon says. \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s a distrust of people in authority generally.\u201dThe Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors says naturopathic medicine aims to stimulate the body\u2019s own healing power to fight underlying causes of disease. Its members are required to identify when health issues are beyond their \u201cscope of practice\u201d and to refer patients to physicians or other health-care professionals.Beverly Huang, president of the College of Naturopathic Doctors of Alberta, says there are about 250 registered naturopathic doctors in the province. Their goal is to try to prevent disease.\u201cOur doctors are required to understand their limitations of their practice and, as such, when the situation arises where a naturopathic doctor recognizes the patient care is beyond their scope of practice, or beyond their limitations, that they would refer to an appropriate health-care provider,\u201d Huang said.Caulfield is concerned a growing portion of the public is embracing pseudo-science or what he calls \u201cquackademics.\u201dWebsites promise natural cures for everything from attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder to mental illness to cancer. They urge people not to underestimate the powers of Mother Nature.Caulfield says individuals can not only find information that backs their own personal beliefs online, but entire cyber communities that agree with them.\u201cWhen you start insulting and say there\u2019s no evidence to support homeopathy, there\u2019s no evidence to support these kind of whole remedies \u2014 you\u2019re not just insulting the practice \u2014 you\u2019re insulting the individual. It becomes part of their belief system.\u201dCaulfield says it isn\u2019t easy to get people to change.\u201cWhen people are faith-based, which so many of these practitioners really are and so many people that use this, they can\u2019t change their mind, because then they\u2019re losing part of their identity package.Caulfield wants a national dialogue about what he calls pseudo-science.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like there\u2019s this strange, pseudo-science correctiveness \u2026 that stops us from talking honestly about what these guys provide.\u201d', u'IN PHOTOS: 26 years later, Hubble\u2019s images of our universe still amaze usIt has peered 13.4 billion years back in time.

Though it had a rough start (it essentially had to be retrofitted with \u201cglasses\u201d due to a flaw in one of the mirrors), it has shed light on our universe and helped us to see back in time, to the early beginnings of the\xa0universe.Here, we present some of the most incredible images Hubble has taken in\xa0its lifetime.\t\t', u'Urban beehives growing in popularity across CanadaMONTREAL \u2013 The usual summer buzz in cities, amplified by warm weather, backyard barbecues and busy patios, is somewhat louder this year as urban bee-keeping gains popularity.A Montreal-based company is renting out beehives to people who are interested in making their own honey and to learn more about bee-keeping.According to Alveole\u2019s website, there are 15 beehive locations in Toronto, a couple in Quebec City and Maine, and more than 250 locations in Montreal, where the company started in 2012. Alveole says its hands are full with their existing locations, so they won\u2019t be expanding to any more cities for the time being.Declan Rankin Jardin, one of the three founders of Alveole, says cities are actually a better place for bees than the countryside due to floral diversity, lack of other insect competition and a ban on pesticides.READ MORE:\xa0This June, the company is opening up a new honey house in Toronto and Quebec City, where they can educate people on bees and guide them through the bee-keeping process.Alveole says the number of hives being rented out this coming season isn\u2019t final yet, since many people start don\u2019t start the process until later in the spring.Montrealer Karen Hickey says she got into bee-keeping because she saw her neighbours doing it and thought it would be interesting to watch the bees in action, and that she was also concerned about the declining bee population. She got a hive from Alveole last summer and saw a prolific 30-kilogram honey payoff by fall.It\u2019s been amazing \u201cjust watching them in the hive, because we take it apart, and see how they function,\u201d she said in an interview.Once rented, the company places hives in either a backyard, a balcony or a flat roof. The renting period lasts one year, and costs $65 a month. Alveole staff does all the beehive maintenance.There\u2019s just one fly in the ointment \u2013 keeping a hive in backyards can violate some city bylaws.According to the Ontario Bee Act, a hive in Toronto has to be 30 meters away from the road. The Quebec Bees Act says they have to be 15 meters from roadways.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an archaic rule that doesn\u2019t really encourage urban bee-keeping,\u201d says Rankin Jardin. \u201cA lot of installations can be made that are within 30 meters that are totally legitimate and wouldn\u2019t harm bees or people.\u201dBut Rankin Jardin says the bylaws aren\u2019t often enforced. In Montreal, where they have the highest number of hives, Alveole is on good terms with inspectors.\u201cIt works more by complaint basis,\u201d he says. If a neighbour is unhappy and lodges a complaint, inspectors are obliged to come and ask them to change the hive\u2019s location.But Rankin Jardin says that\u2019s only happened twice so far, and is easily avoided if hives are set up and maintained properly.A single installed Alveole hive, about the size of a small laundry basket, can produce 10 to 15 kilograms of honey for the homeowners.The hives, usually made of pine, have 10 frames in them, initially accommodating 10,000 bees. The number can balloon to a colony of 80,000 bees by end of the year; the number grows exponentially since the queen bee in each colony lays 2,000 eggs a day.Rankin Jardin says bees are a good way to educate people in the city on pollination, how hard bees work and the ways in which they get food.He\u2019s hardly alone in his passion for urban bee-keeping.In 2008, the Fairmont Royal York Hotel in Toronto partnered with the Toronto Bee-keepers Co-operative to shed light on the decimating bee population by starting a bee-keeping program on its roof.Today, the hotel has more than 350,000 bees at peak season, while the hotel chain has apiaries on top of 20 Fairmount hotels worldwide.', u'New reef discovered at mouth of Amazon RiverScientists have discovered a reef the size of Delaware at mouth of the Amazon River in South America, according to a new study published in Science Advances.But this reef isn\u2019t anything like a common coral reef.\u201cThis is something totally new and different from what is present in any other part of the globe,\u201d paper author Fabiano Thompson told the Smithsonian. \u201cBut until now, it\u2019s been almost completely overlooked.\u201dThe river discharges fresh water into the ocean at a very high rate, which means the floor is muddy and not a lot of light can get through.It\u2019s drastically different from the sunny skies and clear salt water present at the iconic Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia.As such, it isn\u2019t filled with colourful coral; instead, because of its location, most organisms are sponges and algae. (Some coral was discovered as well.)Thompson and his team started searching the area in 2012; previously only 0.001 per cent of the area had been sampled. The new survey still only scratches the surface: only 10 per cent of the entire system was sampled.But what does the discovery of an Amazonian reef mean for the future?Well, the cataloguing the 73 fish species, 35 algae, coral and more organisms found under the muddy water will help conservationists figure out how reefs can survive in suboptimal conditions, which \u201care accelerating worldwide due to global changes,\u201d the study says.The researchers also are in the midst of identifying 29 specimen that could prove to be new species, and are analysing new microbes that base their metabolism on minerals and a chemicals, instead of light, the magazine reports.That could mean a new, unique ecosystem.And finally, the discovery could prompt conservation and protection efforts, because the Smithsonian says major oil and gas companies have been considering the area for new drilling sites.', u'Astronaut Tim Peake crosses London Marathon finish line from spaceMore than 39,000 people ran the London Marathon on Sunday, including one man who wasn\u2019t in the English capital but 400 kilometres above the Earth.British astronaut Tim Peake ran the 42.2-kilometres harnessed to a treadmill aboard the International Space Station, with a simulation of the route through London\u2019s streets playing on an iPad.The 44-year-old Peake finished in 3 hours and 35 minutes, 20 minutes slower than when the former British Army helicopter test pilot ran the course in 1999.He recorded a good luck message to the runners, which was shown on the marathon route on a big screen.A pair of 31-year-old Kenyans fought the chilly and windy spring elements to claim the men\u2019s and women\u2019s titles.The first half of the men\u2019s race was on pace for the fastest-ever marathon, but Eliud Kipchoge couldn\u2019t keep it up to break the world record, completing the route in front of Buckingham Palace in 2 hours, 3 minutes, 5 seconds.Kipchoge\u2019s time was still more than a minute faster than the previous London record of 2:04:29 set two years ago by Wilson Kipsang, who finished fifth Sunday.The men\u2019s race was about speed but the women provided drama.Jemima Sumgong claimed her first title after overcoming a fall at a water station with less than four miles remaining that left her holding her head in pain. Aselefech Mergia of Ethiopia and Mary Keitany of Kenya fell with Sumgong but they couldn\u2019t recover as strongly, finishing out of the top four.\u201cThe Ethiopian runner clipped my leg and I went down,\u201d Sumgong said.Sumgong also had to contend with a spectator appearing to rush toward her before being tackled by a steward.\u201cAfter my fall I felt hurt, it was very painful because I banged my head very hard but I tried my best to persevere and win the race,\u201d said Sumgong, who did not require stitches to treat the cut above her right eye.That she did, winning in 2 hours, 22 minutes, 58 seconds, with defending champion Tigist Tufa of Ethiopia five seconds behind, and Florence Kiplagat third.It was a first major marathon title for Sumgong, who had previously been a runner-up in Boston, Chicago and New York.', u'Tim Peake prepares for London marathon while aboard space stationIn London, England, tens of thousands of people are gearing up to run in this year\u2019s marathon.Thousands of miles of above them, one man is getting ready to do the same thing.British astronaut Tim Peake has been training in space for this Sunday\u2019s London Marathon.Peake, who\u2019s been in space for four months now, will run the marathon on the International Space Station using a treadmill called COLBERT and his iPad with , an app that will simulate the London streets.He said the view of the streets will help keep him focused and motivated.\u201cOne of the main memories I have of 1999 when I ran the London marathon before was the atmosphere and the crowd,\u201d he explained during a livestream provided by NASA TV Friday. \u201cThat spirit really lifted me the entire way through the race.\u201dEven though he\u2019s required to be in good shape to be an astronaut, the Briton said he may have some issues running the marathon.\u201cI\u2019ve got a guilty admission, I probably do fall into that same category (of not having trained enough for the marathon),\u201d he told reporters.\u201cI\u2019m comfortable that I can get on and run the marathon on Sunday, but I\u2019m certain there\u2019ll be a few points where I\u2019ll wish I\u2019d have done more training.\u201dHe expects to finish the race in 3.5-4 hours, and is running to raise money for .During a livestream interview from the ISS streamed Friday, Peake spoke out about a few of the differences between running on the ground and in space.First off, he\u2019ll only be running with around 75 per cent of his body weight.He uses a harness system to keep him strapped to the treadmill while he runs. The harness is chained to a bungee system which gives him the weight he needs to stimulate the muscles, so that he doesn\u2019t lose too much muscle mass or bone density while he\u2019s in space.Before he starts running, he has to be careful about what he eats, and when he eats it.He said he hadn\u2019t chosen his breakfast yet, but he\u2019d probably eat \u201csome baked beans, sausage and eggs, fairly early on.\u201d\u201cYou certainly don\u2019t want to be running up here on a full stomach,\u201d he explained. \u201cFood in microgravity doesn\u2019t settle very well. It just stays floating around in your stomach.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tDuring the race, one reporter noted he\u2019ll be off the hook for \u201cqueueing for the loo,\u201d a common problem for marathon runners.Peake confirmed this with a laugh, saying his bathroom is conveniently located next to the treadmill.As for recovery, Peake said it will be easier in space.\u201cWeightlessness , I think, is one of the perfect environments, because the moment you stop running and the moment you get off that bungee system your muscles are in a completely relaxed state. I do think we recover faster up here from any aches or strains.\u201d', u"\u2018We\u2019re at risk of losing a lot of species\u2019: The race to save Canada\u2019s wildlifeFrom the mighty polar bear to the wee bumblebee, Canada is at risk of losing its diverse abundance of species as the earth warms up.Canadian researchers are working feverishly to change our ecosystems\u2019 fates.\u201cWe\u2019re at risk of losing a lot of species,\u201d says Laura\xa0Coristine, a\xa02016\xa0Liber Ero Fellowship scholar and PhD candidate in\xa0the University of Ottawa\u2019s Biology Department. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that we need to say, \u2018OK ten years from now we\u2019re going to have lost half our species\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018how many species will be left for our children?'\u201dThe earth keeps shattering temperature records: , globally, and the months of ,  and  followed suit with each one\xa0breaking temperature\xa0records.In an effort to slow the increase in global temperatures, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in New York City Friday to sign the Paris climate accord.

But they\u2019re not moving northward as their range shifts.\u201dCoristine is working to ease movement and migration for Canada\u2019s species and\xa0reduce climate-related wildlife extinction.Her\xa0focus is to look at the barriers and obstacles, such as highways and other developments impeding the species\u2019 survival and movement, as well as to identify areas that need increased protection.\u201cCanada has a fairly comprehensive network of observations for climate,\u201d says Coristine. \u201cWe\u2019ve got numerous models for predicting as well, so we\u2019ve got a really good data set.\u201dThere are hundreds of conservancy groups working in\xa0North America,\xa0Coristine says.

Gas on the star gets super-heated and escapes along its stellar wind (like our solar wind), travelling at a mind-boggling 6.5 million km/h. The interstellar gas gets swept up by the outflow of gas, forming the outer edge of the bubble.The host star lies in the 10 o\u2019clock position in the bubble.As for the different colours, they are due to different gases and varying temperatures. Oxygen emits blue light, while the cooler pillars seen are yellow from the combination of hydrogen and nitrogen.The Bubble Nebula was discovered in 1787 by renowned British astronomer William Herschel. The star is extremely bright and massive, but is short-lived. It\u2019s about four million years old and has already lost most of its hydrogen. In about 10 to 20 million years, it will likely explode as a fantastic supernova.', u'World\u2019s oldest message in a bottle discovered in Germany after 108 years at seaA 108-year-old  is officially the , according to the Guinness World Records, demoting a 99-year-old bottle to second place.Marianne Winkler and her husband found the bottle\xa0on the German island of Amrum in April 2015.She was pleased to find the mysterious bottle, Winkler told\xa0\xa0local newspaper\xa0\xa0in August. She had no idea how old it was.She took it home and followed the instructions written on the glass bottle\u2019s\xa0side: \u201cBREAK THE BOTTLE.\u201dInside was a postcard with instructions written in English, Dutch and German to fill out information about how and where the bottle was found and to mail it back to the Marine Biological Association in the U.K.She did as it asked.\u201cIt was quite a stir when we opened that envelope, as you can imagine,\u201d the biological association\u2019s Guy Baker told the The bottle was one of 1,020 that scientist\xa0George Parker Bidder flung\xa0into the North Sea between 1904 and 1906.Bidder,\xa0who was president of the association between 1939 and 1945,\xa0was using the bottles to\xa0. By tracking where the bottles went he hoped to determine the direction of deep sea currents and help pinpoint the movement of fish.About 55 per cent of Bidder\u2019s bottles were returned within months, the association said,\xa0mostly by fishermen enticed by the promise of a one-shilling reward.Determined to keep its word, the Marine Biological Association found an old shilling on eBay and sent it to Winkler with a thank you note.', u'WATCH: Earth seen in ultra high-definition from spaceJust ahead of Earth Day, NASA has released an ultra-high definition video of our amazing planet as seen from the International Space Station (ISS).Make sure to watch it in the full 4K resolution and on a big screen for the best experience.The video was shot with a special camera\xa0that\xa0records images with detail six times that of other cameras on board the space station.

It consists of\xa0a group of pesticides that target the\xa0neuron pathway found most in insects rather than in vertebrates. However, studies on vertebrates such as mice, rats and fish have found that there is some level of toxicity, which varies on the specific type of neonic used. found that\xa0one such neonic, called imidacloprid, was toxic (which is referred to as\xa0LD50) in many birds as well as fish. (Another similar insecticide called fipronil, which is similar to neonics, was also as toxic.) Sub-lethal levels, meaning that it didn\u2019t result in death, but neurological effects such as reduced learning and cognitive\xa0abilities, was also found in birds and fish exposed to those two pesticides as well as in another neonic called clothianidin.Neonics came into use in the 1990s, but their use skyrocketed within a decade. Today, almost 100 per cent of corn seeds are treated with it here in Canada.The alarm bells for neonics reached a peak in 2014 in Canada when beekeepers in Ontario and Quebec noticed that their bees were dying off at an alarming rate. Health Canada\u2019s Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) visited\xa0some southern Ontario beekeepers and collected samples of their\xa0dead bees. They found that 70 per cent tested positive for neonics.Neonics is water-soluble: it is absorbed and carried throughout a plant, protecting it against pests. The catch is\xa0only 2 to 30 per cent is taken in by the plant. The remaining amount\xa0is taken in by the soil which can then spread to\xa0non-targeted organisms, like butterflies, bees, fish \u2014\xa0and recent evidence suggests even humans.Kumiko Tairo, who spoke at the symposium in Toronto,\xa0has on humans in Gunma Prefecture, near Tokyo. In 2004 and 2005, 78 and 63 patients respectively \u2014\xa0young and old \u2014\xa0began experiencing symptoms such as headaches and memory loss. When examined, many had abnormal ECGs. Then, in 2006 and 2007, there were 1,111 more patients with similar symptoms. The most prevalent symptom in all cases was a headache, followed by shoulder and chest pain.Urinalysis detected\xa0high doses of neonics. Brain scans revealed\xa0that the mid-brain was clearly affected.Tairo and her team found that the likely culprit was tea leaves which were affected by pesticide leaching into the soil. Aerial spraying also put residents at risk of increased exposure due to drift.\u201cNow we are facing the increasingly dangerous presence of neonics in humans,\u201d Tairo said on Tuesday.All patients eventually recovered.While no such human studies have been conducted here in Canada, Glenn Murray, Ontario\u2019s Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, who also addressed the symposium, said there isn\u2019t enough evidence on the\xa0extended\xa0use of NNIs in our environment.\u201cNo one has a clue of long-term use,\u201d he said.The problem, he acknowledged, is that neonics were\xa0only conditionally approved in Canada\xa0but\xa0have been widely used without much solid, independent research done on the consequences or the pervasiveness in the environment.As a result, the Ontario government became\xa0the first province to restrict the widespread use of NNIs. It plans on reducing the number of hectares planted with neonic-treated corn and soybean seeds by 80 per cent by 2017.Although most Canadians live in large urban centres and don\u2019t need to worry about neonics being sprayed on corn, they can be found in a multitude of other sources, including at your local garden centres.A \xa0by Friends of the Earth found that 51 per cent of plants tested from commercial nurseries tested positive with neonic residues.Neonics are also used on golf courses and are even present in flea and tick treatments for pets, though in low doses.More concerning is that neonics \u2014 a result of use on farms \u2014 are making their way into waterways.The cases in Gunma are not the only evidence that neonics are harmful to humans.\xa0In 2013, an Indian farmer who was spraying his field with a NNI pesticide was  with symptoms that included nausea, vomiting and muscle twitching. \xa0He also became agitated and delirious. The farmer later recovered.The European Food Safety Authority has also .Though neonics\xa0are targeted at invertebrates, gathering evidence suggests they have far-reaching effects. And how that translates to humans has yet to be fully understood.\u201cMore studies need to be done,\u201d Tairo said.', u'Polar bears swim longer with less ice due to climate change: studyEDMONTON \u2014 Research suggests polar bears are being forced to take long swims more often as climate change reduces Arctic sea ice.It\u2019s particularly hard on mothers with cubs \u2014 a possible explanation for the declining numbers of bears in the southern Beaufort Sea population, said Andrew Derocher, a University of Alberta bear biologist.\u201cWe\u2019re quite certain that one of the mortality factors for cubs is if (mothers) have to take their cubs in open water,\u201d he said.In a paper published Monday, Derocher and his co-authors write about the effect of declining sea ice on polar bear populations in the Beaufort Sea and Hudson Bay. The bears use the ice as a platform to hunt seals, the fat-rich prey they depend on to get through the long Arctic winter.Arctic sea ice has been declining at about 12 per cent a decade since satellite monitoring began in the late 1970s.Derocher and his colleagues worked with data from GPS collars between 2004 and 2012 that detailed the bears\u2019 movements and compared them with satellite imagery detailing the extent of sea ice.Polar bears are amazingly capable in the water and the team chose to concentrate on swims of longer than 50 kilometres. Of the 115 animals that met that requirement, the median swim was 92 kilometres long and lasted 3.4 days.One bear paddled for 404 kilometres.Derocher said that although the data swung widely from year to year, more bears are undertaking such aquatic marathons. Only one-quarter of the bears had done so in 2004. That rose to two-thirds by 2012.The great majority of the long-distance swimmers were from the Beaufort \u2014 largely because of differences in how the sea ice fluctuates, Derocher said.\u201cThe Beaufort Sea ice is almost like Venetian blinds \u2014 they go up and down. If the bears want to stay with the ice they have to go north.\u201cIn the Hudson Bay system, it\u2019s more like watching your laundry go round in your washing machine \u2014 it\u2019s going around in a circle.\u201dThat means while Hudson Bay bears rarely get too far from land, Beaufort bears can find themselves a long way from shore during spring break-up. While healthy bears aren\u2019t too troubled by that, it\u2019s hard on the old, the sick and the young.\u201cLittle cubs at this time of year are incredibly vulnerable to hypothermia.\u201dBy the fall, cubs are strong enough to take the frigid seas. But in spring, mother bears will take long detours on the ice to look for bridges to stay out of the water.Derocher said the Beaufort Sea bears \u2014 which he said have declined by about 50 per cent \u2014 are likely to have to learn to start coming off the ice before it gets too far from shore. That will expose them to the same problem faced by their Hudson Bay cousins: finding enough fat-rich food to sustain them.\u201cThe question becomes, is that a viable strategy for those bears? Can they make a living?\u201d Derocher asked.\u201cIt works in Hudson Bay, but that\u2019s a much different system. All indications are the Beaufort Sea is going to become a really challenging place to maintain polar bears.\u201d', u'Are the Japan and Ecuador earthquakes related?On Sunday, a  killed 350 people and injured hundreds in Ecuador. On Thursday\xa0, a magnitude-6.2 earthquake rattled Japan\u2019s Kyushu\xa0island, , killing at least 42 people. Both countries have seen significant aftershocks.While it may seem like there has been an increase in earthquake activity \u2014 in particular, powerful\xa0earthquakes \u2014 that\u2019s not necessarily the case.\u201cAs far as the grand scheme of things, there isn\u2019t an increase in earthquakes are concerned,\u201d said Julie Dutton, a geophysicist with the .\u201cSometimes with the much larger earthquakes like these, it can trigger some local or even distant effects, where it may increase some amount of background noise, as far as earthquakes,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cThey could be unrelated to rupture zone, but put stresses in the general region that weren\u2019t there before.\u201dSo while a major earthquake could put stress on other tectonic plates nearby, possibly triggering smaller quakes in other sensitive areas, for one to cause another major earthquake on the other side of the world is \u201cunreasonable,\u201d she said.Japan is well-known for its seismic activity. Located in the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d an area bordering\xa0the Pacific Ocean where several tectonic plates move, Japan can experience an earthquake every day.Ecuador sits on the Nazca plate which is sliding beneath another plate, the South American. As it does this, stress builds, which eventually is released in the form of an earthquake.', u'Here are the worst toxins Apple removed from the iPhoneOne of Apple\u2019s main objectives, besides increasing iPhone sales, is improving its environmental sustainability \u2013 from finding new ways to recycle iPhone parts, to ensuring its data centres run on renewable energy.But Apple has also been busy making sure its products contain fewer toxins than its competitors.In its  the company identified some of the worst toxins found in its products and when they were removed.For example, did you know arsenic is traditionally used in display glass?According to Apple, its display glass has been arsenic-free since 2008.Apple also eliminated the use of mercury \u2013 usually found in LED smartphone displays \u2013 in 2009.Apple\u2019s environmental responsibility report also revealed some interesting numbers about its recycling efforts.The report states that Apple recovered 2,204 pounds of gold and 6,612 pounds of silver, worth millions of dollars, from old devices recycled by users.During its media event in March, the company announced the addition of a new iPhone disabling robot named \u201cLiam,\u201d which will take iPhones apart piece by piece in order to reuse some of the materials inside.', u'WATCH: Stunning ultra-high-definition video of northern lights seen from spaceThe northern lights are a beautiful, awe-inspiring sight. But to see them from space, even more so.NASA has released an ultra-high-definition video of the northern lights as seen from the International Space Station (ISS). Make sure you watch the video in HD, and the larger the screen, the better.The video uses time-lapse imagery of both the northern lights (called the aurora borealis) and the southern lights (called aurora australis).Aurora occur when charged particles interact with Earth\u2019s magnetic fields. Most often they\u2019re seen at higher latitudes, closer to the poles, but sometimes, after a powerful geomagnetic storm, they can be seen as far south as the United States.See if you can spot familiar constellations and asterisms (such as the Big Dipper).

The Magicicada cicadas have been underground since 1999.While the critters aren\u2019t dangerous, they can be annoying and are expected to arrive in significant numbers.There are expected to be more than 1.5 million cicadas per acre and they are not the smallest of creatures. Full-grown cicadas are 2.4 to 3.3 cm in length.The little critters will begin to emerge from the ground after the soil reaches a steady 18 degrees Celsius for four consecutive days, After that, the cicadas will be creating headaches for local residents as they continue with their constant droning.The loud humming sound is the male\u2019s mating call as they search for the love. Their partners will lay up to 400 eggs on trees before they die, completing their life cycle.The eggs will hatch 4-6 weeks later and the larvae will burrow into the ground, beginning the round.Some people are choosing to embrace the rare appearance of the winged creatures rather than avoid it.In Cleveland, a festival is planned to educate the masses.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a wild ride,\u201d Wendy Weirich, director of Outdoor Experiences for the Cleveland Metroparks \u201cIt\u2019s like Rip Van Winkle for insects.\u201d', u'Reality check: Distracted walking isn\u2019t a big problem. (Distracted driving is.)As cellphones became more common in the early 2000s, one thing became clear \u2014 they mix badly with driving. Within a few years of each other starting in 2009, most provinces\xa0passed laws banning drivers from using cell phones, and especially texting, while driving. The laws were a response to a series of tragic, preventable accidents.Jurisdictions across the developed world passed similar laws.Not surprisingly, the rise of mobile devices\xa0shows up in accident statistics. In Ontario, more and more drivers every year who are hurt or killed in collisions are reported to have been \u2018inattentive\u2019 at the time of the collision. (Similar data wasn\u2019t available for B.C. or Alberta.)In a police accident report, a driver being \u2018inattentive\u2019 can mean any number of things: fiddling with a radio, eating breakfast, dealing with bored\xa0children. Many things could distract drivers, but the only thing that\u2019s changed in the last generation or so is the rising use of mobile devices, which insist on taking up a driver\u2019s attention when it really belongs on the road.\u201cIn my line of work, I do believe that there\u2019s a definitive increase because of that.\u201d(Ontario\u2019s distracted driving law, which took effect in 2010, appears to have no effect on the graph above, but it\u2019s impossible to know whether there would have been more accidents without it.)What about pedestrians? It\u2019s not hard to find someone blundering down a sidewalk while texting, and YouTube offers a chance to watch people busy with their devices\xa0, , or\xa0. ( a compilation.)But do distracted walkers show up in the accident statistics? Not so you\u2019d notice.At the gentle speed of a normal walking pace, we can afford to multitask, while at higher speeds, we can\u2019t, argues Toronto pedestrian activist Dylan Reid.\u201cWe are incredibly good at avoiding each other. On a crowded sidewalk, somehow everybody manages to dodge and avoid each other.\xa0 And not especially because we\u2019re paying attention \u2014 we may be talking to each other as we do it, we may be browsing shops as we do it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not adjusted to multitasking at higher speeds \u2014 cycling speed, or driving speed. That\u2019s when distraction becomes a problem, because we can only pay attention to a limited number of things at a time.\u201dIn Toronto, pedestrian collisions where the pedestrian was coded as inattentive have fallen since 2005, figures released by the city to Global News show. A by the city\u2019s medical officer of health showed that only 13 per cent of pedestrians hit in the city were inattentive for any reason.\u201cThe difficulty is, with cars, what they represent, based on their speed, their size, their weight,\u201d Brown says. \u201cIf you are handing a weapon, you handle it with care. You can\u2019t have distractions, you can\u2019t have multitasking \u2014 you\u2019ve got to have one hundred per cent of your cognitive ability.\u201dNew Jersey recently a law banning texting while walking. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recently launched a against distracted walking \u2014 in which they included talking to other people while walking.But in a recent \xa0at the University of Bath in England, people asked to text while they walked through an obstacle course naturally slowed down, took their time, and didn\u2019t trip or hit an obstacle.\u201cOur results \u2026\xa0suggest that those who walk and text adopt a \u201cprotective\u201d gait pattern alteration in order to minimize the risk of potential accidents,\u201d the scientists wrote.At a pedestrian speed, Brown says, a normal sense of self-preservation has a chance to operate, even if walking doesn\u2019t have your full attention.\u201cWe know that there\u2019s an inherent self-deterrence built into our system, that if I step off that curb, there is a likelihood that I will be either very seriously injured or killed. From a very young age we have a built-in deterrent system of self-preservation that exists with all of us.\u201dIs it a good idea to wander around distracted by a tiny keyboard? Not really.\xa0But 20 years of accident data seems to tell us that it doesn\u2019t belong on a list of big problems, either.', u'7 of the strangest things in our solar systemLast week we discussed the strangest things in our universe. But we have a few odd things closer to home, too, right here in our own solar system. Here are just a few (they are in no particular order):Imagine a hurricane so large that two\xa0Earths could fit inside it. Now, imagine that hurricane lasts for hundreds of years.That\u2019s the case for Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot, a swirling maelstrom that has been dotting the planet for at least 300 years.Jupiter is a massive planet: about 1,000 Earths could fit inside this giant of the solar system. It is considered a gas giant, as it is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. The clouds swirling around the planet move at different rates, producing a stunning vision when seen.Scientists don\u2019t fully understand what is fuelling the Great Red Spot, but they do know some things: the cloud tops are higher than most of the other clouds, about eight kilometres above. The storm has remained in the same place by a flowing eastward jet stream to its south. And the winds are fierce: about 500\xa0km/h around the edge. But the storm itself is fairly calm.Interestingly, the spot has shrunk over the years. In 2013, research indicated that the storm had shrunk to a size of about\xa016,496 km across. That\u2019s significant when you think that when NASA\u2019s Voyager spacecraft flew by in 1979, the storm was calculated to be\xa023,335 km across.If you think Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot is interesting, check out Saturn\u2019s powerful hurricane.Saturn has a swirling storm at its north pole that is shaped like a hexagon.The hexagonal storm was discovered in 1988\xa0when NASA\u2019s scientists examined data sent back from the two Voyager spacecraft that flew past in 1980 and 1981.The storm measures about 32,000 km wide and reaches down about 100 km into Saturn\u2019s atmosphere. Once again, scientists still don\u2019t quite understand what is giving it its bizarre shape, though they know it is related to its jet stream.Using data from the Voyager spacecraft as well as the most recent Cassini mission, scientists found that the points of the hexagon rotate around the centre of the storm at almost the exact same rate that Saturn rotates on its axis.Saturn has a collection of more than 60 moons, making the planet a kind of mini solar system. Each moon is unique, but perhaps none is as fascinating as the\xa0moon with lakes of gasoline, Titan.Titan is Saturn\u2019s largest moon and, in many ways, similar to Earth, with weather systems and even lakes (there is even Ontario Lacus, ie. Lake Ontario). The atmosphere is made up of mostly nitrogen and methane, but also has organic molecules with carbon and hydrogen with some oxygen, which are found in our atmosphere, and are needed for life as we know it.Visit Lake Ontario on Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan? No, thanks.Lakes on Titan are comprised of methane. And just like our water cycle, the lakes of methane form clouds and even methane rain.In 2005, the European Space Agency\u2019s Huygens spacecraft (part of the Cassini mission) actually pierced the haze and landed on the surface. It revealed a hazy, rocky landscape that has only whetted the appetite for further missions to Titan. See  taken by Huygens.Whether or not you\u2019re in the planet or not-a-planet camp, Pluto is a very interesting world.Once considered the ninth planet in our solar system (it was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union in 2006), very little was known about Pluto until 2015\xa0when NASA\u2019s  mission flew past. Since then, a wealth of information has been uncovered about Pluto and its moons.For one, astronomers discovered that Pluto has a far thicker atmosphere than anticipated. It also has had fairly recent (in astronomical terms) geological activity that occurred about 100 million years ago, and icy mountains that are kilometres thick.There was even the belief that Pluto may even have clouds.\xa0But even cooler, it could be home to ice volcanoes.Scientists are still awaiting a lot more data to be downloaded from the New Horizons missions, so this small world is likely to become even stranger.Quit your giggling.Uranus (pronounced YER-an-us if you want to avoid laughter and bad jokes) is the seventh planet in our solar system. But, unlike the rest of the planets in our solar system, it orbits on its side.It\u2019s not known how this happened, but it\u2019s theorized that a large body collided with the large planet, knocking it on its side. It also rotates from west to east (as does Venus). As a result of its bizarre rotation, it only experiences two seasons, each of which last 20 years.\u201cThat\u2019s no moon! It\u2019s a space station!\u201dIf you were approaching Saturn\u2019s moon Mimas, you might mistake the moon as the famed Death Star from .The surface of one of Saturn\u2019s 60+ moons is pockmarked, evidence of a violent time in the moon\u2019s formation as its surface was battered by space debris left over from the formation of our solar system. The biggest crater is the 140-kilometre-wide Herschel Crater, which covers nearly\xa0one-third of its almost 400-kilometre-wide diameter.The moon is the closest major satellite\xa0to Saturn (there are a lot of tiny moons in and around the rings of the planet). Scientists believe Mimas\xa0to be about 1.17 the density of water, meaning that it is likely made up of water ice with a small, rocky core. However, its orbit is slightly elliptical, meaning that at times it is closer to Saturn than other times. This should cause more heating, so scientists are puzzled as to why it doesn\u2019t have geysers of water erupting from its surface much the way that another moon, Enceladus, does (see below).Seems like Saturn\xa0is home to a few of the most interesting things in our solar system.Enceladus is a just about 500 kilometres wide, but is one of the most fascinating bodies in our solar system.In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft discovered that this icy moon is spewing geysers of water vapour into space. Along with water vapour are other gases including carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia and possibly carbon monoxide or nitrogen.In 2015, scientists released a study that found Enceladus is likely home to a liquid ocean. Together with water and thermal heating deep below this ocean, this could be the best place to search for life in our solar system.', u'PM Justin Trudeau gives reporter quick lesson on quantum computing during visit to WaterlooWhat is quantum computing? It seems Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has at least some knowledge of the burgeoning technological field.Before going into politics, Trudeau taught at the elementary and high school level in Vancouver, studied engineering and started a master\u2019s degree in environmental geography. On Friday morning in Waterloo, Ont., Trudeau reached into that background in dealing with a reporter\u2019s question about quantum computing.\u201cI was going to ask you to explain quantum computing but\u2026\u201d the reporter said before asking a serious question about Canada\u2019s role in defeating ISIS.But Trudeau answered the question anyway.\u201cOK, quite simply, normal computers work by\u2026\u201d Trudeau said before being drowned out by laughter and applause.\u201cNo, no, don\u2019t interrupt me, when you walk out of here you will know more, well no, some of you will know far less about quantum computing,\u201d he continued.\u201cA regular computer bit is either a one or a zero, either on or off. A quantum state can be much more complex than that, because as we know, things can be both particle and wave at the same time and the uncertainty around quantum states allows us to encode more information into a much smaller computer.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about quantum computing,\u201d he said as the crowd erupted into applause.So was he right?Global News spoke to a senior faculty member of Quantum Foundations at Perimeter to confirm how accurate the prime minister was.\u201cI was very impressed he made an attempt,\u201d said Dr. Lucien Hardy. \u201cHe got it spot on.\u201dTrudeau\u2019s explanation of quantum computing in relation to standard computers was accurate enough to impress the quantum theorist.\u201cI have never seen a prime minister attempt anything like that,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cHe did a pretty good job of explaining it.\u201d', u'Bedbug battle: study suggests insects developed thicker skin to beat insecticidesBedbugs can be a nightmare for homeowners and travellers alike. The creepy-crawly blood suckers can do a lot more than produce nasty bites; they can cost a pretty penny to get rid of.A new study by the  suggests bedbugs have developed a thicker skin as part of the insect\u2019s evolution.Published in the scientific , researchers said the creatures have grown thicker skin on their exoskeleton to help combat insecticides used by humans to exterminate them.That could explain why getting rid of the bugs in the sheets has become increasingly harder over the years.Lead researcher David Lilly found that the thicker the skin the more likely the bedbugs were to survive exposure to bug sprays.Researchers sprayed groups of bedbugs with insecticide, then separated them into categories, the intolerant, the tolerant and the resistant, and measured the bugs\u2019 hard outer layer.They found that there was a correlation between the thickness of the skin and the spray resistance.But the findings could hopefully help us eradicate the pesky bugs in the future.But until then, don\u2019t let the bedbugs bite.', u'Sarah Palin: \u2018Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am\u2019Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and climate change denier, lashed out beloved science educator \u201cBill Nye the Science Guy\u201d in Washington Thursday, accusing the man of being an alarmist by teaching children global warming is real.Palin was in Washington to promote an anti-climate change documentary , a film that intends to discredit the science behind global warming.\u201cBill Nye is as much as scientist as I am,\u201d the former governor said at the Capitol Hill event, according to . \u201cHe\u2019s a kids\u2019 show actor; he\u2019s not a scientist.\u201dNye makes an appearance in  where he suggests climate change deniers should be jailed.\u201cFor me, as a taxpayer and voter, the introduction of this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen,\u201d Nye told film producer and noted climate change skeptic Marc Moran. \u201cSo I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations as well as in engaging in discussions like this.\u201dAccording to , Palin repeatedly dismissed climate change as changes in weather patterns during Thursday\u2019s event, and told parents to teach their children to doubt climate change.\u201cAsk those questions and not just believe what Bill Nye the Science Guy is trying to tell them,\u201d Palin told the crowd.Nye is a 1977 engineering graduate of Cornell University and has been a children\u2019s science educator since the early \u201890s. He also worked with and designed instruments for use in NASA\u2019s space program, .Heck, NASA has even shut down climate change deniers who post obscure comments on Nye\u2019s Facebook page. is set to open next month with only one showing in Canada.', u'IN PHOTOS: El Ni\xf1o devastates coral reefs in PacificAn expedition to Christmas Island has found that this past year\u2019s record El Ni\xf1o has had a devastating effect on coral reefs near Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean.Coral is actually an animal. The coral we see is made up of hundreds to thousands of small creatures called polyps which are extremely sensitive to temperatures. A\xa0warming of just 1 C to 1.5 C can cause the coral to undergo stress. Microscopic algae called zooxanthellae live inside the coral\u2019s tissue and are responsible for providing coral with their colour. They also provide them with 90 per cent of the energy needed to grow as well as reproduce.Coral bleaching occurs when the relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae breaks down, revealing the white \u201cskeleton\u201d of the host coral.The research team of marine scientists from the  and the  visited Kiritimati Island, known best as Christmas Island, and were shocked to find how\xa0extreme the bleaching event was off the coast.Last November the team visited the reef and found that 50 to 90 per cent of the coral was bleached and as many as 30 per cent were dead. After returning in March, at least 80 per cent were dead and 15 per cent bleached.\u201cChristmas Island\u2019s coral reefs are like ghost towns \u2014 the structures are all still there, but no one is home,\u201d said University of Victoria\xa0biologist Julia Baum. \u201cTo see the reefs change this dramatically in just a few months is shocking.Over the past 10 months, temperatures on Christmas Island have been between 1.5 C and 3 C higher than normal.\u201cThis intense heat stress has transformed some of the world\u2019s healthiest coral reefs into graveyards,\u201d Baum said.The effects of the bleaching extends beyond that of the ocean floor.\u201cChristmas Island\u2019s people rely on the reefs for their food and their livelihoods, so they\u2019ll be profoundly affected by this event,\u201d Baum said.The team will continue to monitor the reef over the years to see how the reef recovers, which they say could take a decade or more.In March,\xa0 of the dramatic bleaching along Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority reported that 50 per cent of the coral deaths were due to sustained above-average sea surface temperatures.', u'MDMA will be approved to aid therapy for PTSD suffers by 2021: research groupFor the first time in decades, Canadian researchers are probing the potential of a psychedelic drug \u2013 ecstasy \u2013 for use in psychotherapy in a clinical trial approved by Health Canada.The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), is investigating the use of MDMA, the pure form of the party drug ecstasy, to assist therapy sessions for people with treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).The early research coming from this team has shown promise in treating those who suffer from some of the most challenging forms of PTSD.Currently available PTSD treatments have little effect on a certain subset of PTSD sufferers considered to be treatment resistant. Dr. Ingrid Pacey, a psychiatrist and the principal investigator for MAPS in Vancouver, says MDMA can help overcome one of the major hurdles for conventional PTSD treatments.\u201cWith talk therapy the person\u2019s fear starts to rise and they block,\u201d Pacey said.MDMA, she said, can help with those blocks by bringing down fear and anxiety.She has worked with trauma survivors for close to 40 years and says that in many cases traditional therapies haven\u2019t been successful in improving quality of life for people suffering from PTSD, \u201cpeople would be in therapy for 10, 15 years. It was a long time. Or if there was no access to that, they would be medicated.\u201dShe says that therapeutic work that would take three or four years in some cases can be done in a couple of months with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.MAPS\u2019 researchers emphasize that in their work MDMA is being used as a tool to aid therapy \u2013 not simply as a medication. In each six- to eight- hour session, a study subject is supervised by two trained therapists. The sessions take place in a comfortable room and combine silent reflection, often aided by music, with loose discussions of issues that arise for the subject under the influence of the drug. The therapists are there to guide the subjects through discussions of topics often too challenging to have without the aid of the drug.The treatment currently under investigation in the clinical trial involves two to five MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions spaced out over the course of eight to 10 weeks and regular contact with therapists between sessions.The Vancouver work is part of a larger study directed by the American based non-profit organization MAPS. The organization\u2019s other trials have been conducted in The United States, Israel and Switzerland.Nigel McCourry of Asheville, N.C., took part in one of these trials. He developed PTSD as a result of a combat tour in Iraq. Despite receiving conventional PTSD treatment he suffered years of nightmares, anxiety, depression and isolation \u2014 he was desperate for help.\u201cI actually didn\u2019t think there was a good shot at ever improving my life. I thought I was going to be really just psychologically wrecked for the rest of my life,\u201d McCourry said.McCourry found out about MAPS\u2019 experimental research and enrolled in one of their trials in South Carolina. While he had few expectations going into the study, he felt relief almost immediately after his first MDMA session. His sleep issues started improving right away and in the weeks to follow his other symptoms improved as well.Two months after McCourry\u2019s MDMA sessions concluded, it was determined he no longer had measurable PTSD. It has now been three years since his treatment concluded and he says he feels cured of his PTSD.\u201cIf I was plotting the quality of my life over time, that since I\u2019d been back from Iraq, it was just steadily going down. And then the MDMA therapy on that same plot was a turning point where, after that, my quality of life just kept going up,\u201d McCourry said.Subjects in these trials were not only war veterans, but first responders, survivors of sexual abuse and childhood trauma. Published work from one of MAPS\u2019 earlier Phase 2\xa0trials found Nigel was not the only one helped by this treatment: 83 per cent of participants in a small group studied no longer had PTSD after two months and maintained this result over the next 3.8 years.Results from the most recent Phase 2\xa0clinical trials are expected to be published fall 2016. MAPS says the data from these trials is generally consistent with these previously published results but is not releasing exact numbers yet.In order for this treatment to be approved for use outside of a clinical trial setting, a Phase 3\xa0trial will need to be conducted and results will need to be replicated on a larger scale with more study participants. The treatment will need to be proven to be both safe and effective.Col. Rakesh Jetly, chief psychiatrist with the Canadian Armed Forces, says he sees a lot of new treatments come by his desk with promising preliminary research that can\u2019t be replicated. However he says that the military is not ruling out the potential of this therapy.Jetly adds that he is not put off by the reputation of ecstasy as a club drug.\u201cThere is a stigma, but I think that\u2019s a mistake \u2026 There\u2019s no such thing as an illicit drug. You know, there\u2019s illicit use of drugs.\u201dResearchers and many of the study\u2019s subjects believe that having this treatment available widely is critical for PTSD sufferers struggling to get help. But even by the research group\u2019s own estimation this treatment is still years away from being available to people outside the trial setting. MAPS goal is to get approval by Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use this drug in therapy by 2021.But the organization still faces the challenges of meeting regulatory requirements, financing the work and fighting the stigma associated with this alternative research.In the meantime, advocates insist that people will suffer without access to this therapy. Nigel McCourry, for one, believes that MDMA-assisted therapy could help prevent suicides of veterans.\u201cIt\u2019s a quick and direct route to feeling like you\u2019ve turned your life around, like that struggle that you\u2019ve been carrying is getting lighter.\u201d', u'Loch Ness monster found (but it\u2019s not what you think)It\u2019s finally happened: the Loch Ness monster has been found. Sort of.Using underwater sonar and camera equipment, an expedition by  discovered the remains of the Loch Ness monster, but not the flesh and blood kind. Instead, what they found was a movie prop of the legendary monster used in the 1970 film\xa0.\u201dThe legend of the Loch Ness monster first made the rounds in 1934\xa0when that ubiquitous photo of old \u201cNessie\u201d as the creature came to be known was published in a local newspaper.

They can contain upwards of thousands of galaxies and span millions of light-years. Even our own Milky Way galaxy is part of cluster called the Local Group. And our cluster is part of other clusters that make up the Virgo Supercluster.While the video above is pretty amazing, it\u2019s the zoomable image that is more so. Be sure to click and have a look for yourselves.It might be hard to believe that those yellowy blobs are galaxies, but they are.

It\u2019s the question that we\u2019ve been asking since we began to understand our cosmos. Now, Stephen Hawking, together with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Russian enterpreneur Yuri Milner, want to  to help answer that question., founded in 2015 by Milner and his wife Julia, is a venture seeking to find evidence of intelligent life. There are currently three separate projects dedicated to this task: ,  and .It\u2019s Starshot \u2014 an innovative and an almost wild idea \u2014 on which the three men are collaborating.Though humans are in the space-faring age \u2014 living and working in space, sending spacecraft to planets throughout our solar system, and plans to head to Mars \u2014 we are mere infants. There are many challenges when it comes to heading out into deep space. One of the biggest is speed.Space is vast, in ways that our human minds have difficulty grasping. The nearest star to us is Alpha Centauri, just over four light-years away. That means, if we could travel at the speed of light \u2014 300,000 kilometres per second \u2014 it would take us four years to get there. And, according to Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, nothing can travel at light speed.But even if we could travel at close to light speed, we\u2019re far behind. To give you an idea just how slow we are, the fastest spacecraft we\u2019ve ever launched was , the mission to Pluto. How fast was it? It travelled roughly\xa045\xa0km/s.So, if we truly want to voyage to other star systems, we need to figure out how to do so much, much faster.This is what Starshot is all about. The idea involves using ground-based lasers that push tiny, ultra-light spacecraft attached to lightsails (sails that are powered by photons, or light). This would allow them to reach speeds of roughly 160 million km/h, or\xa044,704 km/s. At this speed a spacecraft could be reach its destination within 20 years.\u201cAlbert Einstein once imagined riding on a light beam, and his thought experiment led him to the theory of special relativity,\u201d Hawking posted on Facebook. \u201cA little over a century later, we have the chance to attain a significant fraction of that speed: 100 million miles an hour.And the group is setting its sights on Alpha Centauri.This star is actually part of a binary-star system (there is a third star there, but it\u2019s unknown if it is truly part of the system). \xa0Proxima Centauri is the closest of the two\xa0to us. There is even speculation\xa0that an Earth-like planet (or two) exist there. So it is a choice destination.Of course, don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be heading out any time soon. The project is really in its infancy: Breakthrough Initiatives has a , and it\u2019s a lengthy one. It includes photon thrusters, cameras, batteries, and even the structure and coating of the lightsail itself.Though it may seem like we have a long way to go \u2014 the plan is to get the spacecraft ready for the next generation \u2014 it shows that we are already thinking outside conventional means of space travel, and could be the first step in answering the question: are we alone in the universe?\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'Enormous sunspot turns towards Earth, chance of northern lightsThe sun has been very quiet over the past month, but a massive sunspot has formed that is several times the size of Earth.This sunspot group \u2014 designated 2529 \u2014 more than doubled in size over the weekend. It is so big that people have been  it. (Remember never to look directly at the sun!)The last time we had such a large sunspot was in .Sunspots are relatively cooler areas in the region of the sun called the photosphere. This region is about 5,800 Kelvin, whereas the sunspot will have a temperature closer to about 3,800 K. And don\u2019t be fooled: though they look black, they\u2019re actually quite bright. The only reason we perceive them to be darker\xa0is due to the brighter region surrounding them.Typically sunspots appear more often during solar maximums, a period of high solar activity, which happen every 11 years. However, we are currently in a solar minimum, which makes this one very interesting.Sunspots are formed by strong magnetic field lines rising up from within the sun. \xa0They\u2019re not completely understood. However, what is known is that they often produce solar flares. And solar flares can often lead to coronal mass ejections (CME). These fast-moving particles travel along the solar wind and, when they reach Earth, interact with our magnetic field, producing the northern lights.It just so happens that a minor CME, as well as a coronal hole in the sun\u2019s corona, is sending a stream of particles towards Earth. And due to that, the  has issued a minor geomagnetic storm warning. If the skies are dark in the part of Canada where you live, you could see the northern lights Tuesday night.', u'Reality check: You don\u2019t need RFID protection in your walletIt seems like a creepy and very 21st-century crime \u2014 your credit cards being invisibly read and stolen by a futuristic gadget as you walk down the street.A solution is a kind of armour \u2014 keeping credit cardsbehind a discreet\xa0\xa0in a wallet.\xa0Mountain Equipment Co-op, for example, \xa0nearly two dozen wallets, bags, money belts and backpacks equipped with RFID protection.But, here\u2019s the thing: though it is possible to read some credit card data\xa0remotely, there\u2019s not a lot thieves can do with that data.The concept involves a device like the one you tap a contactless credit card on to make a payment, but portable and more sensitive.\u201cIf somebody walks around with a much more high-powered version of that reader, they can read at distances of \u2014 I think that ten feet is probably plausible,\u201d says Queen\u2019s University computer science professor David Skillicorn. \u201cThat means they can read your credit card, but they have to find a way to process it as if they were a merchant.\u201dThe would-be thief\u2019s reader doesn\u2019t have access to the PIN number, or the three-digit security code on the back of the card.\u201cIt\u2019s the other end of the job which is difficult, which is to get the credit card company to pay you as if you were a merchant. That\u2019s not something that is trivial for a criminal to set up. \u201dThis is why it\u2019s essentially unknown for real money to be stolen by real criminals using this method \u2014 not enough data gets read to actually do anything with.\u201cWhose problem\xa0is it if somebody does rip off your card that way?\u201d Skillicorn asks. \u201cIn Canada, it\u2019s the bank\u2019s problem.\u201dSome information can be remotely read from your passport, but unless you\u2019re an international man or woman of mystery, you really don\u2019t need to worry about that either \u2014 it\u2019s almost all heavily encrypted.\u201cThere will be some stuff there that\u2019s plain text, but not very much that\u2019s very useful.

But the mechanics weren\u2019t understood. Why do people report feeling as one with the universe? Why do they hallucinate so vividly?Researchers from  wanted to get a glimpse inside the minds of people who take the drug, so they enlisted 20 volunteers and used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to see the processes in the brain after they took it. This was the first study of its kind.And what they\u2019ve discovered is pretty interesting.For one, normally \u2014 when not on LSD \u2014 the information we see is processed in the visual cortex, at the back of the brain. However, the researchers found that in the volunteers, many other areas of the brain were involved in the processing of visual information. This occurred even when the volunteers\u2019 eyes were closed.The researchers also studied what happened when people reported a change in consciousness.Usually, our brains function as a set of independent processes that work together. But in the case of the LSD users, the fMRI showed that the brain begins to function as a more cohesive unit.\u201cOur results suggest that this effect underlies the profound altered state of consciousness that people often describe during an LSD experience. It is also related to what people sometimes call \u201cego-dissolution,\u201d which means the normal sense of self is broken down and replaced by a sense of reconnection with themselves, others and the natural world,\u201d said Robin Carhart-Harris, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the research.Another interesting finding was that, when the volunteers closed their eyes and listened to music, they reported more complex visions, including scenes from their lives.The brain scan showed the reason for this: a part of the brain called the parahippocampus \u2014 which is involved in personal and mental imagery \u2014 communicated more with the visual cortex when the volunteers listened to music.The researchers hope that their findings\xa0could help determine \u2014 and combat \u2014 instances when certain ideas and patterns become entrenched in our brains\xa0in those suffering from\xa0depression or addiction.The  was published in the ', u'Survey says 1,267 UFOs sighted in Canada in 2015, Quebec leads wayWINNIPEG \u2013 The 2015 Canadian UFO Survey says Quebec leads the country when it comes to sightings of unidentified flying objects.The annual survey by Winnipeg-based Ufology Research was released Monday and says last year had the second-largest number of sightings in the last three decades, with 1,267.The year with the most UFO reports \u2014 a whopping 1,981 \u2014 was 2012, which was also supposed to be the year the world ended, according to the Mayan calendar.Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland reported more UFO sightings last year than the year before, but Quebec alone is responsible for about 35 per cent of all reports in 2015.That\u2019s way up from previous years, when Quebec\u2019s percentage was between five and 15 per cent.There were 97 reports in Montreal alone, followed by 78 in Toronto and 69 in Vancouver; Edmonton was a distant fourth with just 36 sightings.The study said the typical sighting lasts about 16 minutes and more than half of the reports were of simple lights in the sky.The study noted the number of reported UFO sightings remains high and suggested several reasons why, including more secret military flights, better access to reporting sightings, or \u201ceven that the downturn in the economy is leading to an increased desire by some people to look skyward for assistance.\u201dThe study also acknowledged \u201cthere is no incontrovertible evidence that some UFO cases involve extraterrestrial contact. The continued reporting of UFOs by the public and the yearly increase in numbers of UFO reports suggests a need for further examination of the phenomenon by social, medical and/or physical scientists.\u201d', u'The science behind tornadoes: What they are and how they formSpring has begun, which means summer is around the corner. And with it, tornado season.Even though meteorologists\xa0can\u2019t predict exactly when or where a tornado will strike, they do understand the dynamics of them.Simply put, a tornado is a vertically rotating column of air that extends from a cloud (typically a cumulonimbus) down to the ground. They typically form during strong thunderstorms, mainly supercells. These kind of thunderstorms can last for hours and can bring a various assortment of dangerous weather conditions including hail, frequent lightning and high winds.Most tornadoes only last a few minutes, but they can last an hour or more, travelling over many kilometres.On average, the United States gets about 1,300 tornadoes a year, putting it at the top spot in the world for tornado occurrences. Surprisingly, Canada comes in at number two with about 100 tornadoes a year.There are two critical elements to producing a tornado: updraft and wind shear.Updraft is the upward movement of air; wind shear is the change in direction or speed of wind with height.With supercell thunderstorms, sometimes the rotating column of air on the ground is raised vertically by the updraft. The rising column of air can cause a mesocyclone, a rotating thunderstorm. It\u2019s these rotating thunderstorms out of which a tornado is born.The rotating column of air descends and brings down the water vapour with it, in the form of a\xa0funnel cloud. When the funnel touches the ground, we call it a tornado (it isn\u2019t a tornado until it reaches the ground).Though tornadoes can last over an hour, the average duration is 10 minutes, according to the U.S. .The strength of tornadoes is measured using something called the Enhanced Fujita scale.Though the U.S. is famous for its \u201ctornado alley,\u201d Canada has two of its own:\xa0 one,\xa0in Ontario, stretches from Windsor northeast toward eastern Ontario; the second is spread out across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.Most tornadoes in Canada occur in southern Ontario and the Prairies.And while the public is fascinated with tornadoes, stopping to record one can put you in extreme danger. Even though you might think the tornado is at a safe distance, it\u2019s important to remember that there is no safe distance: the tornado could change direction (it\u2019s often difficult to tell in which direction it\u2019s moving) and the main source of injury and death isn\u2019t the tornado itself, but the debris that can be flung at great distances and at tremendous speeds.\xa0', u'Radioactive wild boars overrun northern Japan 5 years after nuclear disasterFive years after a tsunami damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, radioactive wild boars are wreaking havoc in nearby towns.According to a report in , the boars are terrorizing residents in communities. There are estimates that $15 million worth of damage has been done to agriculture since the proliferation of the boars.The wild boars are so\xa0copious \u2014 rising from 3,000 in 2014 to 13,000 today \u2014 \xa0that local officials who\xa0are sweeping through the countryside trying to cull the animals are having a difficult time\xa0getting rid of the carcasses.Incinerators and mass graves holding some 600 boars just can\u2019t keep up.In March 2011, a 9.0 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, creating a tsunami that killed almost 16,000 people and caused about $300 billion in damages. The tsunami caused a meltdown in the Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which resulted in the release of radioactive material in the region.Much of the immediate area was abandoned, which, for the wild boars, created ideal conditions for reproducing.Though boars can be eaten, tests on these wild ones\xa0have produced radiation levels 300 times that safe for human consumption, likely as a result of the pigs eating contaminated vegetation in the area.It is estimated that radiation levels will remain high for about 30 years.', u'5 of the weirdest things in our universeThey say that truth is stranger than fiction. And what\u2019s true in our universe is bizarre.\xa0From planets made of diamonds to raspberry-smelling clouds of gas, we live in a pretty wild place. Here are just some of the things that might leave you scratching your head.Have you ever wondered what space smells like? Probably not. But it turns out that at least some it would smell quite pleasant if we could actually smell anything at all in space.In 2009, scientists from the  in Bonn, Germany, made an accidental discovery while looking for amino acids (the building blocks of life as we know it) in the Milky Way.While analyzing a dense cloudy region in\xa0an arm of our galaxy, they discovered ethyl formate, the chemical that gives raspberries their flavour and rum its smell.So the next time you eat a raspberry \u2014 or have a drink of rum \u2014 just close your eyes: you\u2019re tasting our galaxy.While our own planet has a store of diamonds,\xa0we have to dig deep to get at them. But imagine living on a planet that is overflowing with them.In 2010, astronomers published a study that suggested that\xa055 Cancri e, a planet 40 light-years \xa0from Earth, was abundant in Earth\u2019s most precious mineral: diamond.The star around which the planet orbits, is carbon rich. Carbon, of course, is the material of which diamonds are made. And, since planets and stars form from the same material, that means that the planet itself would be made of carbon.But don\u2019t get any ideas: even if we could get at 55 Cancri e, we wouldn\u2019t want to visit: its surface temperatures can reach 2,150 C. And it turns out that\u2019s what helps make it a diamond. \xa0It is twice the size of\xa0our own planet, and\xa0eight times its mass.However, not everyone is convinced: in 2013, astronomers published a study that suggested\xa0that the planet may be wetter than we previously thought.Even if 55 Cancri e isn\u2019t as rich in diamonds as we thought, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that a star far more carbon-rich than 55 Cancri e could have a diamond planet orbiting it.Fans of the original \xa0series will remember a famous episode titled, \u201cMirror, Mirror,\u201d where the crew of the  come across a universe where they encounter the opposite of themselves (even if you\u2019re not a fan, you may have seen the image of a goateed Spock, aka the \u201cevil\u201d Spock).It turns out that this is true of our universe.The universe as we know it, is comprised of matter. But on the opposite end, there\u2019s antimatter.Antimatter was created during the Big Bang, the beginning of our universe. The sub-atomic particles of matter have properties that are the exact opposite in the form of antimatter.What you see isn\u2019t always what you get.Looking up at a dark sky \u2014 a truly dark sky \u2014 we can see billions of stars. Beyond that lies a hundred billion\xa0galaxies with billions of stars. Knowing that, it might seem like our universe is jammed packed. But it turns out what we are looking at is but a fraction of what is out there: a mere five per cent.Instead, dark matter makes up about 27 per cent of our universe and dark energy makes up about 68 per cent.The best thing is, astronomers don\u2019t really know what these things are, hence the vague names given.However, they know they\u2019re there because of how they interact with our universe. \xa0Dark energy is affecting the expansion of the universe; dark matter, on the other hand accounts for unseen mass within and between galaxies.We know planets orbit stars. But surprisingly, there are planets that just meander their way through space.These worlds, known as rogue planets, are surprisingly common. It\u2019s believed that there could be  alone.The worlds are believed to have formed in a solar system, but somehow were flung out to space. They could also be left wandering space after a star explodes, throwing it out into space.Though frozen, these worlds (since they have no star) are believed to have molten cores and perhaps even liquid water. And who knows? Possibly even microbial life able to live in such a frozen planet.', u'Global warming is changing how Earth wobbles: NASAWASHINGTON \u2013 Global warming is shifting the way the Earth wobbles on its polar axis, a new NASA study finds.Melting ice sheets, especially in Greenland, are changing the distribution of weight on Earth. And that has caused both the North Pole and the wobble, which is called polar motion, to change course, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances.Scientists and navigators have been accurately measuring the true pole and polar motion since 1899, and for almost the entire 20th century they migrated a bit toward Canada. But that has changed with this century, and now it\u2019s moving toward England, said study lead author Surendra Adhikari at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab.\u201cThe recent shift from the 20th-century direction is very dramatic,\u201d Adhikari said.While scientists say the shift is harmless, it is meaningful. Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences at the University of Arizona, who wasn\u2019t part of the study, said that \u201cthis highlights how real and profoundly large an impact humans are having on the planet.\u201dSince 2003, Greenland has lost on average more than 600 trillion pounds of ice a year, and that affects the way the Earth wobbles in a manner similar to a figure skater lifting one leg while spinning, said NASA scientist Eirk Ivins, the study\u2019s co-author.On top of that, West Antarctica loses 275 trillion tons of ice and East Antarctica gains about 165 trillion tons of ice yearly, helping tilt the wobble further, Ivins said.They all combine to pull polar motion toward the east, Adhikari said.Jianli Chen, a senior research scientist at the University of Texas\u2019 Center for Space Research, first attributed the pole shift to climate change in 2013, and he said this new study takes his work a step further.\u201cThere is nothing to worry about,\u201d said Chen, who wasn\u2019t part of the NASA study. \u201cIt is just another interesting effect of climate change.\u201d', u'SpaceX launching supplies to space station including inflatable roomCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2013 Forget blowup air mattresses. Space station astronauts are getting their first inflatable room.It\u2019s a technology demo meant to pave the way for moon bases and Mars expeditions, as well as orbiting outposts catering to scientists and tourists. Bigelow Aerospace is behind the experiment, which will get a ride to the International Space Station with another private space company.An unmanned SpaceX Falcon rocket is set to launch late Friday afternoon, carrying a capsule full of supplies with the pioneering pod in its trunk. It will be SpaceX\u2019s first station delivery since a launch accident halted shipments last June.Once attached to the station, the soft-sided Bigelow compartment will be inflated to the size of a small bedroom. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, BEAM for short, will stay there for two years \u2013 with astronauts occasionally ducking in. It will be the first time an astronaut steps inside an expandable habitat structure in space.\u201cIt\u2019s not just historic for our company, which obviously is the case, but I think it\u2019s historic for the architecture,\u201d said Robert Bigelow, founder and president of Bigelow Aerospace, and owner of Budget Suites of America.As a precursor to larger systems, Bigelow said BEAM could \u201cchange the entire dynamic for human habitation\u201d in space.In the meantime, companies- even countries \u2013 are clamouring to put their own experiments inside the empty BEAM, Bigelow said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. If everything goes well, that next commercial step could happen in perhaps six months, he said.The North Las Vegas-based company won\u2019t divulge the material used for BEAM\u2019s outer layers \u2013 or even how many layers \u2013 just that the layers are spread out to absorb and break up any penetrating bits of space junk. Back when NASA was working on the technology in the 1990s, a combination of Nextel, Kevlar, foam and other fabric formed the multilayer shield.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tNASA called its project TransHab, for Transit Habitat. It never flew to space, despite elaborate blueprints and ground mock-ups. Designers envisioned an inflatable, four-level compartment, complete with dining, sleeping and exercising areas for station crews.Congress cancelled TransHab in 2000 and Bigelow Aerospace bought the patent from NASA. The company launched a pair of expandable spacecraft a decade ago from Russia as an experiment. Called Genesis I and II, they\u2019re still orbiting.NASA, meanwhile, paid Bigelow Aerospace $17.8 million for the upcoming test flight, making the BEAM the most affordable module ever launched to the space station, said Michael Gold, director of operations and business growth for Bigelow Aerospace.Expandable habitats like BEAM, officials noted, need to be just as strong \u2013 or stronger \u2013 than the standard metal cylinders that make up the current space station. BEAM has proven to be equal or better against space debris than metal, said NASA project manager Rajib Dasgupta.Bigelow goes as far as to say: \u201cThe aluminum cans are antiquated.\u201dBeyond low-Earth orbit, radiation poses increased health risks to crews inside aluminum walls. So inflatable spacecraft, he said, are cheaper, bigger, safer and, potentially, longer lasting.Bigelow said BEAM is nothing like a single-membrane balloon \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not going to go bang\u201d \u2013 or even a football. Think steel belts in a car tire. Even then, \u201cthere really isn\u2019t much of a comparison, there really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s pretty novel.\u201dThe beauty of expandable habitats is their compactness for launch. BEAM will travel in the Dragon capsule\u2019s unpressurized compartment; the space station\u2019s big robot arm will grab the structure and attach it to a berthing port. BEAM will expand four times in volume when it is inflated in late May, with a little station air at first, then special inflation tanks.The collapsed BEAM measures about 7 feet long (2 metres) and 8 feet (2 1/2 meters) in diameter. Inflated, it will be about 13 feet long (4 metres) and 10 1/2 feet (3 metres) in diameter, and provide 565 cubic feet (16 cubic meters) of space, about the size of a small bedroom.BEAM has been bundled up and unopened for more than a year \u2013 it should have flown last fall, but was delayed by the SpaceX rocket grounding. Bigelow stressed that the main purpose is testing and they don\u2019t know now how well it will work after being compressed for so long.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tThe chamber will stay put for two years, providing measurements on radiation, impact resistance and temperature. Astronauts will venture inside four to six times a year to inspect surfaces, collect air and microbial samples, and change out sensors. Otherwise, the hatch will remain sealed.After two years, BEAM will be cut loose, eventually burning up on re-entry.Bigelow Aerospace has plans for a much larger expandable habitat B330, providing 11,654 cubic feet (330 cubic meters) of internal space, the size of a couple of buses. Then there\u2019s the company\u2019s envisioned Olympus, a supersize space station-hotel combo. NASA, meanwhile, imagines inflatable modules at Mars awaiting astronauts travelling in the traditional Orion spacecraft that is hooked up with inflatable compartments to ease the eight-month, one-way journey.\u201cIt\u2019s an important piece to the human space exploration puzzle,\u201d Gold said. \u201cRegardless of where you go, you need a place to live and work.\u201d', u'\u2018Hot Jupiter\u2019 found in triple-star systemImagine waking up to a beautiful sunrise \u2014 with three suns brightening the sky. If you could live on KELT-4Ab, this would be your morning.Scientists have found a triple-star system 685 light-years from Earth\xa0as well as\xa0a rarity: a planet in a stable orbit within it. are actually quite common in our universe, with estimates that about half of all stars are part of one. But finding a planet in such a system\xa0is rare.Astronomers are always looking for exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars. One of the methods in which they do this is by observing a star and seeing if its light dims. If it does, this could be an indication that a planet is crossing, or transiting, the star.The\xa0Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) witnessed such a transit. KELT-A dimmed every few days.\xa0Then, astronomer Justin Crepp of the University of Notre Dame, was asked to further investigate using the Keck Telescope in Hawaii.\xa0While imaging, he\xa0made a surprising discovery.\u201cI found that there was a dot nearby, which we believed to be a star, making this a binary [two-star] system,\u201d Crepp said. \u201cAnd then upon further review, I found that it was two dots. We wouldn\u2019t have realized that without these photos.\u201dThe planet, KELT-4Ab, is about one-and-a-half times the size of the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter. It orbits the main star in the system every three days.However, the rest of the system is much larger: the other two stars orbit one another once every 30 years, and the main star once every 4,000 years.Most of the exoplanets that have been discovered have been Jupiter-sized, as they are easier to spot. Astronomers once believed that most of these giant gas planets form at distant orbits from their host stars, just as Jupiter did in our solar system. However, in 1995, the first \u201chot Jupiter\u201d \u2014 a gas giant in a relatively close orbit to its star \u2014 was discovered, forcing astronomers to reconsider their theories.\u201cWe are trying to learn how planets get to their final resting places in orbits around stars,\u201d said Crepp. \u201cThis discovery has implications for our understanding of planet formation and evolution.\u201d', u'English Bay oil spill one year later: what\u2019s changed and who paid?On April 8, it will be one year since Vancouverites woke up to news of .And still, no fines have been levied against the polluter and no costs have been recuperated for the emergency spill response.The spill began on the evening of April 8, but it took a few days to confirm that Cypriot grain-carrying MV Marathassa was in fact the source of the fuel leak.Transport Canada said the ship appeared to suffer a malfunction when it leaked about 2,700 litres of Bunker C fuel on its maiden voyage to Vancouver, launching a massive clean-up effort.In the aftermath of the spill, it was made known that the operators of the MV Marathassa agreed to pay for the clean-up and the ship was allowed to leave Canadian waters.Transport Canada told Global News it could not outline the costs associated with the spill and it\u2019s continuing its investigation into the MV Marathassa\u2019s \u201cfuel discharge\u201d and the owners have been cooperating.Under the Marine Liability Act, the polluter is always responsible for paying the cost of an oil spill cleanup, including third party damages. This means that if a ship causes a spill, its owner is liable for losses and damages.The maximum penalty provisions include a fine of $1 million or 18 months imprisonment.According to a city spokesperson, they are currently working with the Canadian Coast Guard, First Nations, other local governments, and provincial and federal partners to develop a Burrard Inlet-specific Oil Spill Response Plan, which should be completed in 2016.In the meantime, the city says it has already worked to improve a number of areas that include improving notification protocols and the sharing of situational awareness.Both  are identical to the ones given in December 2015 to Global News, regarding a year-end follow-up story on the spill.Since the 2015 oil spill, the CCG says it has made \u201csignificant\u201d progress. Along with plans to re-open and enhance Kitsilano as a Coast Guard Base with an expanded mandate for environmental and emergency response training for province\u2019s coastal region, they have also completed several actions.Those actions include: additional training in emergency and major spill response, notification procedures and systems improvements, and developing a Greater Vancouver Integrated Response Plan, which will outline how organizations work together to manage a spill.While various government agencies are shy about tallying the numbers, there\u2019s one organization that knows what their efforts cost in relation to the oil spill. And ironically, they\u2019re the one organization whose costs cannot be recovered by the polluter; instead the  (WRA), a non-profit, has to take the $21,000 financial hit.After being notified by the public about the spill, the WRA assembled their emergency response team and went to recover the wildlife impacted by the accident. They then fed, cleaned and medically treated numerous bufflehead ducks covered by fuel before eventually releasing them back into the wild.Since the spill happened, WRA executive director Coleen Doucette says there has been no change in terms of wildlife regulations in B.C.Currently in Canada there is no legislation to ensure that wildlife is looked after during a spill response.That\u2019s why partnerships with , which is owned by the American multinational consumer goods company Procter and Gamble, are so important, according to Doucette.In addition to lobbying corporations for support, Doucette says the WRA has been working with the wildlife agencies both federally and provincially for more than 10 years to try to implement change and include wildlife in the response program.But unfortunately they tend to fall victim to the lack of legislation in Canada both coastally and inland.In this arena, Canada falls behind other countries like the United States, New Zealand and United Kingdom who all have regulations that include wildlife in spill response. Its one reason, Doucette says, WRA and other wildlife agencies in Canada have all the protocols in place for caring for animals.In March,  in east Vancouver and the birds had to get a full oil spill bath from workers at WRA.While dangerous goods spills in B.C. water are not wholly uncommon, there were on average 2.6 spills every day in the province\u2019s ocean in 2014.According to statistics from Emergency Management B.C., there were 932 spills of dangerous goods into B.C. ocean waters in the 2014-15 fiscal year. This was the highest number in 15 years \u2013 the average over that time has been 845 per year.Ironically Doucette says the cost of wildlife response goes up when they are not prepared; which makes the preparedness planning process and integrating wildlife rescue as part of the response, so important.With lobbying the federal and provincial governments for wildlife regulations falling short, Doucette says the WRA is looking to corporations to help.\u201cWRA is working very hard in positioning ourselves to be prepared for any of these incidences,\u201d Doucette says.\u201cSo we\u2019re looking to corporations to step in, taking a role like Dawn has done, so we can build an emergency response unit to be on the front lines.\u201dFor more information on the WRA or to get involved as a volunteer or be a part of their preparedness team, .', u'WATCH: Bizarre creature or whale? What was spotted in the River Thames?It\u2019s not the Loch Ness monster, but\u2026what is it?A video of something large moving through London\u2019s River Thames was shot from the Emirates Airline (a cable car in London) and uploaded to YouTube two weeks ago by the user Penn Plate. It has now gone viral.Of course, people are suggesting that it\u2019s some mysterious creature (it can\u2019t be the Loch Ness monster since that\u2019s in\xa0Scotland \u2014 unless Nessie decided to\xa0take a holiday).But\xa0there are a few explanations\xa0that don\u2019t involve the word \u201cmonster,\u201d \u201ccreature\u201d or even \u201calien.\u201dFor one, whales \u2014 though, rare \u2014 have been seen . The \xa0even notes that mammals such as seals and whales are using the river.In January 2006, a whale that had lost its way from the North Sea, swam upstream in the Thames. According to , it was the first time since 1913 that a northern bottlenose whale had been seen in the river. She died a day later.There are also some suggestions that it could be a submarine. However, whatever it is in the video looks more natural than human-built.And then there are some who suggest the whole thing could be a hoax.Nobody else has reported seeing the \u201cThames Monster,\u201d but you can be sure that many will be trying to spot whatever it was.\xa0', u'Astronomers discover supermassive black hole in unlikely placeThe discovery was made using the \u2018s Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) as well as the giant  telescope in Hawaii.The black hole at the centre of NGC 1600 weighs about 17 billion times that of our own sun and lies within an elliptical galaxy (think: blob of stars) in a fairly empty area of our universe.\xa0It\u2019s akin to driving through a small town and suddenly coming upon a towering skyscraper, said the\xa0Hubble release.What makes this discovery so unusual isn\u2019t that it\u2019s just in an area with few galaxies: it also lies in the fact that the black hole is 10 times more massive than what they had predicted for a galaxy of that mass. Based on previous observations, astronomers had\xa0come to believe that the larger a galaxy\u2019s bulge, the more massive the black hole. But this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case when it comes to this galaxy.It\u2019s believed that supermassive black holes \u2014 those that are about 10 billion times the mass of our sun \u2014 occur when two large black holes merge. As time goes on, it is fed with more and more gas and therefore becomes more massive. When it comes to NGC 1600, it must have been well fed.\u201cTo become this massive, the black hole would have had a very voracious phase during which it devoured lots of gas,\u201d said lead discoverer Chung-Pei Ma, a University of California-Berkeley astronomer.However, most of NGC 1600\u2019s gas was consumed a very long time ago.\u201cNow, the black hole is a sleeping giant,\u201d Ma said.To date, the largest supermassive black hole weighs 21 billion times that of our sun.', u'Scientists to drill into dinosaur-killing craterApproximately 66 million years ago a large piece of rock came hurtling from space through our sky, slamming into Earth, causing the mass extinction event that eventually wiped out the dinosaurs. Now a team of scientists is embarking on a mission to drill into the massive crater it left behind.The mighty reign of the dinosaurs came to an end after 135 million years on this planet when the asteroid hit\xa0just off the Yucatan Peninsula. The extinction event is known as the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event or K-T boundary, and it wiped out about 70 per cent of life on this planet.When the object \u2014 believed to be about 15 km in diameter \u2014 hit, it created tsunamis that travelled around the globe; a super-heated cloud of dust and debris soared about 10 km high before it settled back down, creating a peak ring\xa0(the ring that remained inside the crater itself). And it\u2019s this peak ring that scientists will be exploring later this week.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe\xa0180-km-wide crater went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community until about 1978. That year two geophysicists, Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo, were working for a drilling company when they noticed the crater on\xa0geophysical maps of the area. Around the same time, a scientific paper was released theorizing that a cataclysmic event slammed into Earth around 65 million years ago, causing the K-T boundary.Moreover, the presence of iridium \u2014 a mineral that is rare on the surface on Earth but common on asteroids \u2014 was found in the area, lending support to the theory that it was here that a large asteroid slammed into\xa0Earth resulting in the mass extinction. Since then, the theory has been widely supported.Now geologists that include those from the \xa0are heading to the crater to drill about 1,500 metres deep in an effort to better understand the impact, how it occurred, how it changed our ecology and environment.While there have been other expeditions that drilled down into the rock, they were conducted\xa0from land, on the peninsula itself. This will be the first that will drill offshore and into its peak ring (the ring that remained inside the crater itself).As they drill, they will bore through various layers that will yield clues as to geological processes and ecological periods of our planet. It is like reading a history book about Earth.\xa0At 600 metres, for example, they will pass through rock from a time when temperatures across the globe spiked.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what this material will look like,\u201d Jaime Urrutia-Fucugauchi, a geophysicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City\xa0told .\xa0\u201cIt could be a real surprise.\u201dThe offshore expedition runs through April 6, with onshore work going on until June.']

[u'Eugenie Bouchard\u2019s struggles point to double standard, say expertsTORONTO \u2013 \u2018s  during her precipitous fall in the women\u2019s tennis rankings came as no surprise to one former Olympian who now works as a sports psychology consultant to some of Canada\u2019s top athletes.Former elite runner Penny Werthner says female athletes are held to a much different standard than their male counterparts.\u201cThe women athletes are criticized for what they wear, what they look like, whether they\u2019re fat or not,\u201d said Werthner, also dean of the faculty of kinesiology at the University of Calgary.\u201cWhen was the last time someone commented on what (Novak) Djokovic looked like? Or (pointed out that Rafael) Nadal is short?\u201dBouchard revealed earlier this week that she suffered from an eating disorder brought on by \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d following her 2014 breakthrough, when she finished the year ranked seventh in the world.The career-high came after her loss to Petra Kvitova in the Wimbledon final and semifinal appearances at the French Open and Australian Open.The success that season quickly launched her to tennis superstardom, drawing cameras, media and fans wherever she went.But the streak didn\u2019t last. Her first match after the Wimbledon final was the Rogers Cup in Montreal, where the hometown favourite disappointed with a 6-0, 2-6, 6-0 loss to 113th-ranked qualifier Shelby Rogers.It didn\u2019t get much better as the year wore on \u2014 her ranking plummeted to 48th at the end of 2015.Bouchard now says last year also featured a private battle to keep food down and maintain her weight.\u201cI just felt so nervous, it was hard to eat before matches and sometimes at other meals, just hard to keep it down. I didn\u2019t try to lose weight, but it definitely happened. It was definitely a cause of the stress. I\u2019ve learned a lot from it, and I know I just have to force food down my throat even if I feel sick because I am burning so many calories.\u201dWerthner says the push to succeed is especially hard in tennis because it\u2019s a solitary sport and comes with the added pressures of courting sponsors and endorsement deals.And in general, she said, it can be especially hard for women to rebound from a loss because they tend to take failures personally, while men will sometimes place the blame elsewhere.\u201cYou lose a match and then you lose a little bit of confidence and then maybe an eating disorder comes out of that or maybe it comes out of something else in her life that\u2019s not directly related to competitive sport,\u201d said Werthner, who has worked as a sports psychology consultant for the Canadian Olympic team since 1985.Bouchard, currently ranked 47th, was eliminated from the French Open on Thursday after a second-round loss to Timea Bacsinszky.Marbella Carlos of the National Eating Disorder Information Centre in Toronto says eating disorders are a coping mechanism and usually point to greater issues behind the scenes.And they can be especially common in \u201caesthetic sports\u201d like dance and gymnastics. She said tennis players also battle social stigmas that have nothing to do with their abilities.\u201cEven though they\u2019re elite athletes and do these incredible things with their bodies they\u2019re still looked at through a sexualized gaze, that definitely could have contributed as well,\u201d she said.Carlos hopes that Bouchard\u2019s comments can help other people struggling with food issues.\u201cThere are a lot, a lot of Canadians who are suffering in silence because there\u2019s still a lot of shame and stigma that\u2019s associated with mental illness and especially with eating disorders,\u201d she said.\u201cTypically people think eating disorders only strike a certain type of person but eating disorders affect people from all backgrounds, all ages, all genders, and all sizes.\u201d', u'Baylor demotes president, fires coach amid sex assaults scandalAUSTIN, Texas \u2013 Baylor University demoted school President Ken Starr and fired football coach Art Briles on Thursday, issuing a scathing report over the university\u2019s handling of sexual assault complaints against players.The board of regents at the nation\u2019s largest Baptist university said in a statement that Starr, a former prosecutor who investigated the Monica Lewinsky scandal, will vacate the presidency on May 31 and stay on as school chancellor. It said it suspended Briles \u201cwith intent to terminate\u201d and placed athletic director Ian McCaw on probation.Laura Seay, an outspoken critic of the Baylor University\u2019s response to the sexual assault claims says she\u2019s spoken with women who criticized the Baptist school\u2019s handling of such claims when they were students there in the 1970s.Seay, a 2000 graduate of the Waco, Texas, school, said Thursday that the administration too often has opted to give offenders a second chance and not served as an advocate for victims.She says she\u2019s not surprised by a law firm\u2019s highly critical report on the school\u2019s handling of sexual assault claims but that she was \u201cshocked\u201d to read that officials retaliated against someone for reporting an assault.Now\xa0an assistant professor of government at Colby College in Maine, Seay helped draft a critical letter to Baylor regents this year that received more than 1,000 signatures.Starr asked a law firm last year to review Baylor\u2019s handling of sexual assault cases following allegations that the school mishandled several cases in which football players were accused of attacking women.Among the firm\u2019s findings was that football coaches and athletics administrators at the school in the central Texas city of Waco had run their own improper investigations into rape claims and that in some cases, they chose not to report such allegations to an administrator outside of athletics.By running their own \u201cuntrained\u201d investigations and meeting directly with a complainant, football staff \u201cimproperly discredited\u201d complainants claims and \u201cdenied them a right to a fair, impartial and informed investigation.\u201d\u201cThe choices made by football staff and athletics leadership, in some instances, posed a risk to campus safety and the integrity of the University,\u201d the report states.The report\u2019s \u201cfindings of facts\u201d did not name specific coaches or athletics staff.The university\u2019s statement said the review revealed \u201ca fundamental failure.\u201dThe report also found that\u2019s Baylor was too slow to enact federally-required student conduct processes, and that administrators failed to identify and eliminate a \u201cpotential hostile environment\u201d for victims.Baylor has faced increasing criticism in recent months for its handling of reports of rape and other violent incidents involving football players and students. One victim has sued the university, saying it was deliberately indifferent to her allegations against a former player who was eventually convicted of sexually assaulting her.Starr ordered an investigation last year but has been mostly silent amid the criticism. The former prosecutor took over as the university\u2019s president in 2010, about a decade after he investigated former President Clinton\u2019s sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewisnky.The football team enjoyed unprecedented success under Briles\u2019 tenure, including two Big 12 championships in the last three years. That success brought a financial windfall, and in 2014, Baylor opened a new, $250-million on-campus football stadium. But Briles\u2019 program has also been criticized for recruiting or accepting transfer players without regard to the harm they might cause fellow students.Starr rode the waves of the program\u2019s success, and often ran on the football field with Baylor students in pregame ceremonies. But as investigations began into the school\u2019s handling of sexual assault allegations against players, Starr provided only brief comments, even as criticism of the school mounted.In a February statement issued by university, Starr said \u201cour hearts break for those whose lives are impacted by execrable acts of sexual violence.\u201d And at a prayer breakfast last month, Starr told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: \u201cI am in favour of transparency. Stand up, take your medicine if you made a mistake.\u201dStarr initiated the law firm\u2019s review last year, after former football player Sam Ukwuachu was convicted of sexually assaulting a female soccer player.Ukwuachu, who was convicted last year, transferred to Baylor after he was dismissed from Boise State. His former girlfriend testified during his rape trial in Texas that he had struck and choked her when he attended Boise State.Ukwuachu\u2019s former coach, Chris Petersen, now the coach at Washington, said he \u201cthoroughly apprised\u201d Briles about the circumstances of Ukuwachu\u2019s dismissal. Briles disputed that account, saying he talked with Petersen and there was no mention of the incident.The school is also facing a federal lawsuit from a former student claiming the school was \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to rape allegations levied at a former football player Tevin Elliott, who was convicted in 2014 of sexually assaulting the woman.The uproar following Ukwuachu\u2019s conviction caused Baylor to initiate the review by the Philadelphia law firm Pepper Hamilton, and to announce a $5 million effort to improve efforts on how it responds to sexual assault, including adding another investigator and more staff.But the Ukwuachu case was just the start of months of revelations of football players being involved in violent incidents with little or no repercussions. At least seven other woman have publicly come forward to say the school ignored their sexual assault allegations.', u'Cavaliers crush Raptors 116-78 in Game 5CLEVELAND \u2013 The Toronto Raptors rode a wave of momentum into Cleveland on Wednesday.But by the merciful end of an atrocious Game 5 effort, it was tough to believe the Raptors had ever beaten the Cavaliers at all.Cleveland\u2019s trio of Kevin Love, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving combined for 71 points as the Cavaliers thoroughly trounced the Raptors 116-78 to take a 3-2 lead in the NBA Eastern Conference finals.\u201cThey kicked out butts. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said in the post-game news conference, over the cheering of a Cavs fan out in the corridor.DeMar DeRozan had just 14 points, while Kyle Lowry had 13, but no other Raptor scored in double digits in Toronto\u2019s worst performance of these playoffs. Jonas Valanciunas returned from his ankle injury to score nine points in 19 minutes.The Raptors were coming off back-to-back victories at the Air Canada Centre, infusing fans with a glimmer of hope for an historic NBA finals appearance. But the Cavaliers\u2019 homecourt had proven deadly to Toronto in Games 1 and 2: a 50-point deficit combined.The Raptors are now a loss away from ending the deepest playoff run in franchise history.Casey has predicted a different game on their return trip to Cleveland, but it was evident virtually from the opening whistle that they were in for a long night.\u201cWe knew they were going to come out like a freight train and they did, and we didn\u2019t meet that level of physicality on either end of the floor,\u201d Casey said.Instead, they laid down on the tracks. In a noisy Quicken Loans Arena awash in wine and gold, the Raptors looked completely discombobulated. They were terrible in virtually every category, a dog\u2019s breakfast of poor decisions, terrible shooting, and head-slapping turnovers. Their defensive effort, against a Cavs team that opened the post-season 10-0, was half-hearted.\u201cWe just didn\u2019t get in a rhythm,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cIt was kind of stagnant. We had (19) turnovers, that\u2019s (19) opportunities that we could have had to at least run something. . . but we turned it away.\u201dThey\u2019d dug themselves an 18-point deficit by late in the first quarter, and when Love drained a three-pointer late in the second, the Cavs were up by a whopping 34 points. Cleveland\u2019s 65-34 lead at the break was the biggest halftime gap in conference finals history.When it seemingly couldn\u2019t get worse, it did. Frustration mounted. The Raptors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else. And by the end of the third, the score was a shocking 100-60.Both teams subbed out their starters for a fourth quarter played after hundreds of fans had already departed the building. According to ESPN Stats, it was the fifth largest margin of victory in conference finals history.Lowry and DeRozan shot just 7-for-20 between them against a smothering Cavaliers defence, and DeRozan was left lamenting his lack of activity.\u201cI only took eight shots, and a couple of shots came late in the game when we were down,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come out aggressive like I wanted to. . . just got to understand no matter how they play, just got out there an be aggressive.\u201cJust eight shots throughout the whole game \u2013 that\u2019s not me.\u201dCavs coach Tyronn Lue had blamed their two losses in Toronto on poor shooting, and his team proved him right. The Cavs shot 57 per cent on the night. Love, who\u2019d made just five of 23 shots in Games 3 and 4, topped Cleveland with 25 points on 8-for-10 shooting.The Cavs grabbed 48 rebounds to Toronto\u2019s 27 \u2013 just one more than Bismack Biyombo had, on his own, in Game 3. Biyombo had just four rebounds after grabbing 40 the past two games.The Raptors coughed up 30 points on 19 turnovers.The series returns to the Air Canada Centre for Game 6 on Friday. A victory, however, would send them back into Cleveland for a do-or-die Game 7, where the noise reached ear-splitting levels Wednesday night in a crowd that included Montreal Canadiens star P.K. Subban and Browns defensive back Joe Haden.While the Raptors won the regular-season series against Cleveland, all their victories came at home. They\u2019ve now lost all four trips across the border this season.Asked why the Cavs are so lethal at home, Lowry shrugged.\u201cI dunno,\u201d he said. \u201cThey play extremely well here. Tonight, Kevin Love got it going early, Kyrie got it going early. LeBron did what he usually does. We\u2019ve got to take one of them out of the game.\u201cThey play very well here, they\u2019ve protected home all year.\u201dShots of Canadians Drake, Justin Bieber and Nickelback flashed on the Jumbotron, encouraging fans to boo. Late in the game, the camera focused on a downcast Raptors fan folding his \u201cWe The North\u201d flag.DeRozan\u2019s four points were the most by a Raptor in a first quarter that saw Toronto trail by just four points before the Cavs closed the quarter on a 17-3 run to end the frame up 37-19.Lowry\u2019s six points topped Toronto in the second quarter, but they were barely noticeable in a quarter the Cavaliers outscored their visitors 28-15.', u'Marner and Tkachuk power London Knights to Memorial Cup final berthRED DEER, Alta. \u2013 It\u2019s been 54 days since the London Knights last suffered a loss. They will attempt to run their win streak to 17 games when they play in the Memorial Cup final.Matthew Tkachuk scored twice and Mitch Marner had four assists as London downed the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies 5-2 on Tuesday to earn their spot in the tournament\u2019s championship game.The Knights last dropped a decision in the first round of the Ontario Hockey League playoffs on April 1 and have gone undefeated through round-robin play at the Memorial Cup.\u201cWe\u201dre one win away from capping off one of the best seasons in junior hockey history,\u201d said Tkachuk.\u201cFeels good, kids really worked hard\u2026.deserved to win,\u201d said London coach Dale Hunter.JJ Piccinich, Christian Dvorak and Max Jones also scored for the Knights (3-0).Marner\u2019s four assists gives him a tournament-best 13 points in three games and leaves him three points off the Memorial Cup record set in 1982 by Jeff Larmer and matched in 1986 by Guy Rouleau.Timo Meier scored twice for the Huskies (1-2), who won\u2019t know their tournament fate until after the host Red Deer Rebels (1-1) play the WHL champion Brandon Wheat Kings (0-2) in the final preliminary-round game on Wednesday.Tyler Parsons made 30 saves for the win. Chase Marchand stopped 20-of-24 shots in a losing cause.London went 3 for 7 on the power play while Rouyn-Noranda scored twice on 10 chances with the man advantage. The Knights have nine power-play goals at the tournament. The other three teams have combined for just eight.Antoine Waked gifted the OHL champions a scoring opportunity just nine seconds into the game when he took a roughing minor while trying to get under the skin of a Knights skater after the whistle.Jeremy Lauzon took another penalty minutes later and this time London made the QMJHL champions pay. Piccinich scored at 13:54, taking a feed out front of the net from Dvorak to make it 1-0.Tkachuk doubled London\u2019s lead with another power-play goal with 2:17 left in the first. Tkachuk, the son of former NHLer Keith Tkachuk, was standing at the top of the crease and deflected an Olli Juolevi shot past Marchand.\u201c(He) definitely has some (Keith in him)\u2026that\u2019s why he\u2019s a great player,\u201d said Hunter.Zachary Lauzon had to be helped off after being run into the end boards by Chandler Yakimowicz less than four minutes into the second period. Yakimowicz was handed a major and a game misconduct for checking from behind.Gabriel Fontaine had the best scoring chance for Rouyn-Noranda on the power play, but Parsons got his right pad down to keep it 2-0 London.Meier finally put the Huskies on the board at the midway point of the period while on the power play after snapping the puck through traffic over Parsons\u2019 glove hand.Marner was patient as he set up London\u2019s third goal at 17:28, while shorthanded. Marner got Marchand to commit before sliding the puck cross crease to Jones, who had a wide-open net for the finish.Tkachuk landed awkwardly late in the second and hobbled to the bench with what appeared to be a leg issue, but was back on his regular line to start the third period.\u201c(I) can\u2019t comment on that,\u201d Tkachuk said when asked if he was playing hurt.Dvorak made it 4-1 with London\u2019s third power-play goal of the evening at 6:26 of the third, chipping in a rebound from the side of the net after Tkachuk put the puck on goal from between the circles.\u201cA lot of them weren\u2019t very good penalties but it was both ways,\u201d said Parsons. \u201cOur penalty kill was great tonight, everyone blocking shots, getting the puck out.\u201dMeier made it a 4-2 score with his second goal of the game at 7:59 while on the power play. The goal needed a video review before it was confirmed.Tkachuk added another into an empty net for London in the final minute.Hunter plans to give his team the day off on Wednesday, with the championship game set for Sunday.

PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2013 Is Hulk Hogan\u2019s courtroom cage match with  being bankrolled by a high-tech billionaire with a grudge against the news-and-gossip site?Two months after Hogan won a $140 million invasion-of-privacy verdict against Gawker for posting a sex tape of him, news reports say the pro wrestler is secretly backed by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook, was outed as gay by a Gawker-owned website in 2007, and the Gawker empire has run a number of stories skewering Facebook.On Wednesday, Hogan and Gawker were back in a Florida court, where Judge Pamela Campbell denied his request for a new trial and refused to reduce the damages. Gawker vows to take the case to an appeals court.Swirling in the background of the legal proceedings were reports in The New York Times and Forbes that Thiel is footing Hogan\u2019s legal bills against their common enemy, Gawker. The news stories cited unidentified sources.Thiel, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $2.7 billion, didn\u2019t immediately respond to interview requests made through email or on the voicemail of a mobile phone number he previously provided to an Associated Press reporter.Gawker reacted to the reports by saying: \u201cWe trust the appeals court will correct the outsized Florida jury verdict and reaffirm the law that protects a free and critical press, which is more embattled and important than ever.\u201dHogan\u2019s lawyers wouldn\u2019t comment on the Thiel story but praised the judge for denying a new trial and accused Gawker of refusing to accept responsibility for \u201ctheir reprehensible behaviour and method of doing what they call journalism.\u201dLegal experts say there is nothing illegal \u2013 or even unethical \u2013 about someone financing a lawsuit. There are entire companies that invest in contingency claims, usually in product liability, personal injury, patent infringement and copyright cases. It is called \u201clitigation financing.\u201dBut a billionaire doing it out of what may be spite? That\u2019s a little different, experts say.\u201cAs much as this is not at all illegal or unethical, it just smells and feels wrong,\u201d said Scott Greenfield, a New York lawyer who is managing editor of Fault Lines, an online legal magazine. \u201cWhen a rich guy can basically afford to bring down a media outlet, that has horrible social ramifications, even if the particular outfit is one that everybody hates, like Gawker.\u201dGawker is counting on the case to be overturned on appeal and has not said whether it can afford the full $140 million. During the trial, Gawker\u2019s parent company, a collection of websites called Gawker Media, was estimated to be worth $83 million.Earlier this month, Hogan sued Gawker again, saying the website leaked sealed court documents containing a transcript that quoted him making racist remarks. After the National Enquirer published the story, the WWE pro wrestling company severed its ties with Hogan. Gawker denies it leaked the transcript.In legal circles, attorney James Sammataro of Miami said people speculated how Hogan could afford such a large \u201cdream team\u201d of lawyers.Said Miami attorney Richard Wolfe: \u201cIt sounds to me that Hulk Hogan made a smart deal by getting the right guy to finance his lawsuit.\u201d', u'Raptors look to steal road win in Cleveland after tying series at homeCLEVELAND \u2013 The Toronto Raptors have found a way to beat Cleveland at home.Now they head back into the inhospitable Quicken Loans Arena with the daunting task of stealing a game on the road.The Raptors dropped the opening two games of the Eastern Conference final by a combined 50 points on the Cavaliers\u2019 home court, before knotting the series at 2-2 with a pair of thrilling victories at home.Same city, but coach Dwane Casey is predicting a much different game this time against the backdrop of Cavs\u2019 wine and gold.\u201cI will say this: It\u2019s going to be a different animal back in Cleveland, as it is in every series,\u201d Casey said Tuesday. \u201cWhen you go into another team\u2019s home territory, it\u2019s a little bit tougher. But (the two wins) does give us more rhythm and more confidence going against them now that we have a little bit better feel of what we can and cannot do against this team.\u201dThe Raptors opened the conference finals two nights after dispatching Miami in seven games in the semis, and faced a Cavs team coming off nine days of rest.Over four games, they\u2019ve become more familiar with what the Cavs are trying to do, Casey said, and they\u2019ve become confident in their ability to stop it.\u201cIt gets into a little more of a chess match as the series goes on,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned some things, and I\u2019m sure they have too.\u201dThe Raptors are 8-2 at home and 2-6 on the road in the post-season, winning Game 3 in both Indiana and Miami.The Raptors are proving everyone wrong after virtually no-one gave them a chance of more than a token win in this series. Now Canada\u2019s lone NBA franchise is two victories away from the NBA finals, prompting ESPN host Stephen A. Smith to apologize Tuesday night to \u201call Canadians everywhere\u201d for doubting the Raptors.\u201cI can\u2019t put into words how stunned I am, I can\u2019t believe what I saw,\u201d Smith said.\u201cI gotta be a man of my word and just apologize to Canada, all Canadians everywhere because I certainly thought that this was going back to Cleveland, 3-1 \xe2\u20ac\xa6 with the Cavs closing this series out on Wednesday night so I wouldn\u2019t have to go back to Canada and go through customs and all that other nonsense.\u201dSmith called the Raptors winning two straight \u201cinexplicable.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened to Cleveland right now,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey don\u2019t resemble the team that has won 10 straight playoff games prior to losing the last two.\u201dThe key to a win Wednesday, Casey said, is limiting the Cavaliers\u2019 runs. Game 2 in Cleveland was tied late in the second quarter but the Cavs closed out the half with a brisk 16-2 run. It was a hole too deep for the Raptors to dig out of.\u201cThe games that we lost there, there were probably three- or four-minute segments, portions of the game that really did us in in both games,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIf we can sustain our defence against their runs and not let them blow it open in those three- or four-minute segments. . . and we\u2019ve got to respond offensively.\u201dToronto\u2019s all-star backcourt was superb in Tuesday\u2019s victory \u2013 Kyle Lowry had 35 points while DeMar DeRozan added 32.Each has struggled at times these playoffs, but when they\u2019re both firing on all cylinders, pity the opponent.\u201cThey\u2019re always dangerous with the guys they have who can get going at any time,\u201d said Cleveland\u2019s backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova. \u201cOnce they get it going, it\u2019s hard to stop because they hit tough shots and make plays. It\u2019s up to us to try to take them out of their rhythm and make it as hard as possible on them.\u201dCasey hopes to get Jonas Valanciunas into Game 5, but it depends on the Cavs\u2019 lineup. Valanciunas, who sprained his ankle in Game 3 of the Miami series, rejoined the active roster ahead of Tuesday\u2019s game, but didn\u2019t play.\u201cI know he\u2019s our starting centre, but it\u2019s tough to put him out there if they\u2019re playing Channing Frye big minutes at (centre),\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe just have to make sure that he has a matchup and he\u2019s not out there chasing three-point shooters all around the perimeter.\u201cHe\u2019s going to be valuable for us because he is an excellent passer and can make plays from the top of the key.\u201d', u'ESPN\u2019s Stephen A.

We\u2019ve been counted out, and we liked that challenge.\u201dLeBron James led the Cavaliers with 29 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Point guard Kyrie Irving scored 26 points and added six assists with three rebounds.Few picked the Raptors to steal more than a token win against the Cavs, who roared red-hot into the conference finals having swept Detroit and Atlanta.Toronto dropped Games 1 and 2 in Cleveland by a combined 50 points, and it seemed the Raptors were writing their obituary. But bolstered by the hometown crowd, they won Game 3 in dominant fashion.Backed by Lowry\u2019s sharp-shooting on Monday, the Raptors raced out to an 18-point first half lead. But the Cavaliers, who\u2019d made just three of their 22 three-point shots in the first half, started hitting from long distance. And when Irving drained two in a row, he pointed at Drake \u2013 the Toronto rapper and Cavs heckler \u2013 as he ran back upcourt.The Raptors led 78-69 to start the fourth, but when Channing Frye drained three straight threes, and James scored on a driving layup with 8:20 left, the Cavaliers took their first lead of the game.\u201cAt the beginning of the fourth quarter, we lost our composure,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWhen we put the starters back in, they regained their foothold. I thought that was huge for us. I\u2019ve always said: compete with poise, stay consistent with your emotions. That\u2019s paying dividends for us now as we go through this tough series with a great Cleveland team.\u201dToronto hit back with five straight points to take a three-point advantage into the game\u2019s final three minutes. The Raptors were up by four with a minute to play and their defence came up huge, with a couple of key rebounds and a Biyombo block.Lowry drove to the hoop for a basket with 23 seconds left, to the ear-splitting roar of the Air Canada Centre crowd, and was fouled on the play. He missed both free throws, but crowd didn\u2019t care \u2013 they saluted him with chants of \u201cM-V-P!\u201d\u201cNo matter what, we\u2019re confident,\u201d Patrick Patterson said. \u201cWhen we were down 0-2, we were still confident. We\u2019re always going to believe in ourselves. We\u2019re always going to have faith that we can win \u2013 whether we\u2019re down, whether we\u2019re on the road, whether we\u2019re home, we\u2019re going to constantly believe that we can win.\u201dGame 5 is Wednesday in Cleveland, then the series returns to Toronto for Game 6 on Friday.The post-season has been a roller-coaster for the Raptors, especially Lowry and DeRozan. The two were asked what has been their steadying force.\u201cUnderstand the work that we\u2019ve put in. I know the work he\u2019s put in and I know the work I\u2019ve put in,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go away from that. The things that we\u2019ve learned is one game, two games erases everything that has happened before.\u201d\u201cWe can take the bad with the good any day,\u201d DeRozan added. \u201cIt\u2019s life, man. You can\u2019t get too down when things not going your way, but you understand the work that you put in all summer, all throughout the season, for moments like this.\xa0\u201cI always told this guy (Lowry) when we were struggling, it\u2019s not about now, as long as we\u2019ve got an opportunity to keep playing, we\u2019ve got an opportunity to make up for this.\u201dA day after Casey was fined US$25,000 for criticizing the officiating, the referees drew the ire of Toronto fans once again.The Raptors didn\u2019t go to the free throw line once in the first half \u2013 a rare occurrence. According to Elias Sports Bureau, the last time a team led by at least 15 at halftime in a conference finals without a free throw attempt was Milwaukee in 2001 versus Philadelphia.When the Cavs were whistled for their first foul, the crowd gave the referees a sarcastic standing ovation.The ACC crowd, all in white, was in full voice from the opening tipoff, and included NFL legend Terrell Owens and Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy, Edmonton Eskimos quarterback Mike Reilly, Toronto FC star striker Sebastian Giovinco and actor Stephen Amell, star of the superhero TV drama Arrow.The Raptors raced out to another strong start, shooting 52 per cent in the first quarter, and holding the Cavs to 21 per cent from three-point range. Toronto took a 27-24 lead into the second.The Raptors kept up a torrid pace in the second, and when Lowry scored on a step-back jumper with 32 seconds to play in the half, the bucket boosted Toronto\u2019s advantage to 18 points. They headed into the locker-room up 57-41.', u'Tony Gwynn\u2019s family sues tobacco industry over baseball great\u2019s deathSAN DIEGO \u2013 Tony Gwynn\u2019s widow and two children have filed a lawsuit seeking to hold the tobacco industry accountable for the Hall of Famer\u2019s death.The suit was filed in San Diego Superior Court by Alicia Gwynn and her children, Tony Jr. and Anisha Gwynn-Jones.The suit says Gwynn started dipping as a 17-year-old freshman ballplayer at San Diego State.

Game 5 goes Wednesday in Cleveland.Valanciunas, who badly sprained his ankle in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals versus Miami, tested his ankle in the morning shootaround and pre-game warmups.Toronto coach Dwane Casey said Valanciunas would see limited playing time if healthy.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to put him out there and run him long minutes at a time,\u201d he said prior to the game. \u201cHe\u2019s been off for a long period of time, so we\u2019ll slowly reintegrate him back in.\u201dCasey said he expects the Cavaliers to test Valanciunas if he plays.The Raptors upgraded Valanciunas\u2019s status from \u201cdoubtful\u201d to \u201cquestionable\u201d before Monday\u2019s game.The 24-year-old from Lithuania was playing some of the best basketball of his career this post-season, averaging 15 points, 12.1 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in 10 games, and Raptors GM Masai Ujiri said recently Valanciunas would be the best big man in this series \u201cby far.\u201dBismack Biyombo has stepped up admirably in Valanciunas\u2019s absence, grabbing 26 rebounds in the Raptors\u2019 Game 3 win.', u'Raptors\u2019 Valanciunas takes part in practice but team mum on statusTORONTO \u2013 Jonas Valanciunas participated in Monday morning\u2019s shootaround, but the Toronto Raptors remain mum on the big man\u2019s playing status.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see how he reacts this afternoon,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cHe\u2019s still pretty sore, but we\u2019re going to wait and see.\u201dAsked if there was any chance he\u2019d play on Monday night, Casey said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dValanciunas badly sprained his ankle in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals versus Miami.The Raptors go into Monday\u2019s game trailing the Cavaliers two games to one in their Eastern Conference finals debut.

Their statement said no attempt was made to stop the recording and that the group received \u201chomophobic taunts\u201d while being escorted off the field.The group claims at least one fan yelled, \u201cYou sing like a girl,\u201d as they left the diamond.Chorus members called for the Padres and Major League Baseball to investigate whether anyone intentionally played a woman\u2019s voice \u201cwith the purpose of denigrating and/or ridiculing gay men.\u201dThe Padres issued a statement Saturday night saying a mistake was made that prevented the chorus from performing and that \u201cwe apologize to anyone in the ballpark who this may have offended.\u201dThe Padres said they\u2019d reached out to the chorus \u201cto express our deep regret for the error.\u201dThe Padres said they had cut ties with the contractor \u201cresponsible for the error,\u201d and disciplined an employee for not stopping the recording.Billy Bean, an MLB vice-president for social responsibility and inclusion, tweeted Sunday that \u201cit was very unfortunate that there was a technical error\u201d that prevented the chorus from performing but added that the Padres \u201chave supported our inclusion message at MLB without hesitation.\u201d Bean, a former Padres player, revealed he was gay in 1999, four years after his final major league season.With files from The Associated Press.', u'Former Leafs coach and ECHL Hall of Famer John Brophy dies after lengthy illnessTORONTO \u2013 Former NHL head coach John Brophy has died. He was 83.The ECHL, where Brophy coached for 13 seasons, said in a statement Monday the native of Antigonish, N.S., died after a lengthy illness.Brophy took over head coaching duties of the Maple Leafs for the 1986-87 season, leading Toronto into the second round of the playoffs. He was fired 33 games into the 1988-89 season after the Leafs got off to an 11-20-2 start.\u201cSad to hear on the passing of John Brophy \u2013 Maple Leafs a coach who was demanding, intense, a tad out there & passionate,\u201d former Leafs centre Ed Olczyk posted on Twitter.Brophy signed on as head coach of the ECHL\u2019s Hampton Roads Admirals for the 1989-90 season. He led the Admirals to three league titles over 11 seasons.He ended his ECHL coaching career with two years behind the bench of the Wheeling Nailers, retiring after the 2002-03 season.', u'Late season additions paying off for Red Deer RebelsRED DEER, Alta. \u2013 The Red Deer Rebels sold off parts of the future in an attempt to win the 2016 Memorial Cup as the host team. It paid off on Sunday.Adam Helewka scored twice and Jake DeBrusk added a goal and two assists as the host Rebels beat the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies 5-2.Helewka, 20, and 19-year-old DeBrusk were added near the WHL trade deadline along with Luke Philp, also 19. The trio of veterans cost Red Deer six roster players and six draft picks over the next two years, including a first-rounder in 2017.\u201cWe know why we were brought here and this was a moment we had to be different makers,\u201d said Helewka, who scored 26 goals in 34 games for the Rebels after being acquired from the Spokane Chiefs.Philp had a single assist, but also won 21-of-31 faceoffs.The victory keeps Red Deer\u2019s tournament hopes very much alive after losing its opener to the OHL champion London Knights. Another loss would have left the Rebels in a do-or-die situation in their final round-robin game of the tournament against the WHL champion Brandon Wheat Kings.Evan Polei and Haydn Fleury also scored for the Rebels (1-1), while Rylan Toth made 22 saves.Timo Meier and Julien Nantel struck for the Huskies (1-1), who got a 33-save outing from Chase Marchand.Red Deer\u2019s Nelson Nogier, a 2014 Winnipeg Jets draft pick, took a cross-checking penalty 3:26 into the first period that led to the game\u2019s opening goal. Meier was able to beat Toth from just inside the right face-off circle for his third goal of the tournament 51 seconds into the power play.It didn\u2019t take very long for the Huskies to double their lead as Nantel broke into the zone down the left side and snapped the puck through Toth\u2019s legs at the eight-minute mark.Rebels coach Brent Sutter called a timeout right after the goal to try and reset, and it seemed to spark his team.\u201cBrent made a couple comments that really made us change our game,\u201d said Helewka, a 2015 San Jose Sharks draft pick. \u201cHe told us to just simplify. We know (the Huskies) are a fast team so we tried to play in their zone and limit the turnovers, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201dPolei got one back for the Rebels at 11:07 with a clean wrist shot between Marchand\u2019s pads to make it 2-1, bringing the sold-out crowd of 7,000 at Enmax Centrium to their feet for the first time since opening faceoff.Red Deer outshot the No. 1 ranked team in the country 7-0 to end the first and kept up the pressure early in the second, tying the game just 40 seconds into the period. DeBrusk made a pretty feed out front of the net to Helewka, who beat Marchand blocker side.Four minutes later, while on the power play, Ivan Nikolishin put a point shot on net that DeBrusk tipped past Marchand for a 3-2 lead.\u201cAs soon as we got the lead the crowd went nuts and we just kept saying score more, score more,\u201d said DeBrusk, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 draft by the Boston Bruins.A goaltender interference penalty called on Rouyn-Noranda\u2019s Anthony-John Greer led to Red Deer going up 4-2 with 11:09 to play in the second. DeBrusk, once again, found Helewka for his second of the game and third of the tournament.At that point the Rebels were in full control and had a 19-4 shot advantage since finding their legs on Polei\u2019s opening marker.Greer picked up two and 10 for unsportsmanlike conduct midway through the third after arguing with the officials about an embellishment call. It left him unable to finish the game.\u201cI overreacted, I saw it a different way than the refs did (but) I learn from my mistakes,\u201d said the Colorado Avalanche prospect.Fleury added a late power-play goal to help earn Red Deer its first win at the tournament.Notes: Only one host team in the past eight tournaments has gone on to win the Memorial Cup, the 2012 Shawinigan Cataractes\u2026 The London Knights (1-0) will play the Brandon Wheat Kings (0-1) on Monday.', u'Coach Casey fined by NBA, Jones suspended for low blow on BiyomboNEW YORK \u2013 Cleveland\u2019s Dahntay Jones has been suspended for one game by the NBA for striking Toronto\u2019s Bismack Biyombo in the groin.The league also fined Raptors coach Dwane Casey $25,000 on Sunday for his criticisms of the officiating.Biyombo remained on his knees on the court after time expired in Game 3 on Saturday night after Jones hit him with 17.6 seconds remaining. The little-used reserve will miss Game 4 of the series Monday night.Casey\u2019s comments, including his belief that Biyombo isn\u2019t getting enough calls, came in his postgame press conference following the Raptors\u2019 99-84 victory. Cleveland leads the series 2-1.\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'Canada\u2019s Hinchcliffe wins pole position on final run for Indy 500INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 Canadian James Hinchcliffe watched the Indianapolis 500 last year from his hospital bed. He had nearly died from injuries six days earlier in a crash at famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway.Now he\u2019ll start the historic 100th running of \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle In Racing\u201d from the pole.The Oakville, Ont., native continued his remarkable comeback Sunday by edging American Josef Newgarden for the top starting spot next Sunday. Hinchcliffe earned the pole with a four-lap average of 230.760 mph.A day after qualifying last year, Hinchcliffe spun and hit the wall during a practice session. The impact caused a piece of his car to break and sail through his thigh. Hinchcliffe would have bled to death if not for the fast work of IndyCar\u2019s medical team, which staunched the bleeding and raced him to a nearby hospital for life-saving surgery.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can describe nearly losing your life at a track, then going back there to go 240 mph into a corner,\u201d said Ryan Hunter-Reay, one of the many drivers to congratulate Hinchcliffe after his pole-winning run Sunday.Newgarden will start second after qualifying at 230.700, and the difference between Hinchcliffe and Newgarden was the fourth-closest between first and second in Indy\u2019s 100-year history.Hinchcliffe won it in dramatic fashion, too, on the final run of the nine-car pole shootout. It also came on the fifth anniversary of team owner Sam Schmidt\u2019s team winning the pole in 2011.\u201cMom moved in on May 1st, she didn\u2019t want to miss a lap, just in case I tried to kill myself again,\u201d Hinchcliffe said about his parents, who were on vacation when he crashed last year and IndyCar had to scramble to get them to Indianapolis while their son was in surgery.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tHunter-Reay, the 2014 winner, will start third on the outside of Row 1 after going 230.648. The runs by Hinchcliffe and Hunter-Reay, who drives for Andretti Autosport, put two Hondas on the front row in a season that so far has been dominated by Chevrolet teams. Newgarden will be sandwiched in between the two Hondas in a Chevrolet fielded by Ed Carpenter Racing.For a bit, it seemed as if Newgarden would win the pole. He was the only driver to turn a lap over 231 mph and Hunter-Reay barely knocked him off before Hinchcliffe began his run.Hinchcliffe\u2019s victory marks the first time in six races that Team Penske drivers have not won the pole. It also ends a 31-race pole drought for Honda, which dated to the 2014 race in Houston.It\u2019s also the first time Honda has claimed the Indy 500 pole since 2011, the year before Chevrolet rejoined the engine competition in IndyCars.For Newgarden, it will be his first career front-row start at Indy.Qualifying was marred by one crash. Canada\u2019s Alex Tagliani, who drives for A.J. Foyt, spun coming out of the fourth turn of his warmup lap and slammed into the attenuator at the entrance to pit road. Though his car spun 5 1/2 times, he was quickly checked, released and cleared to drive by the infield medical centre.Tagliani will start last on the traditional 33-car starting gird and will be the first starter since 1924 to start the race without an official qualifying speed.Townsend Bell and Carlos Munoz qualified fourth and fifth to give Andretti three spots in the top five.Will Power was sixth and the highest-qualifying Penske driver.Mikhail Aleshin and Oriol Servia qualified seventh and 10th as Schmidt got all three of his Hondas in the top 10.Defending race winner Juan Pablo Montoya will start 17th after a bizarre sequence in which he ran over a trash bag during his qualifying attempt. IndyCar said the debris on the track was its responsibility and let Montoya try to qualify again, but his pace was not competitive.Scott Dixon qualified 13th and was the highest qualifying driver from Chip Ganassi Racing, as both Ganassi and Penske were overshadowed Sunday by smaller teams.', u'Raptors hated Biyombo as an opponent, love him as teammateTORONTO \u2013 The Toronto Raptors didn\u2019t much like Bismack Biyombo much when the big man from the Democratic Republic of Congo played for Charlotte.\u201cI hated him,\u201d Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan said Sunday. \u201cHe was a fouler, always blocking shots. He always went for the pump fake though, but I hated Bis.\u201d\u201cHe was a nightmare at Charlotte for us,\u201d added Toronto coach Dwane Casey. \u201cOn the boards, blocking shots, just being a nuisance \u2026 You just have some guys that accidentally bump into you and just hurt you. And that\u2019s Bismack. Not trying to be dirty. It\u2019s just how he plays.\u201dIn the absence of the injured Jonas Valanciunas, the 23-year-old Biyombo has become a force under the basket for the Raptors in the playoffs. A finger-wagging shot-blocker, he is a six-foot-nine 245-pound physical presence.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tHe also energizes the crowd and his teammates. A Biyombo block or dunk at the Air Canada Centre is like igniting a giant barbecue. It\u2019s an impressive spark.Toronto outrebounded Cleveland 54-40 Saturday night with Biyombo pulling down a Toronto playoff-record 26. He added four blocked shots and seven points as the Raptors rallied to trim Cleveland\u2019s lead in the Eastern Conference finals to 2-1 with an emphatic 99-84 win.Game 4 goes Monday night in Toronto.Biyombo\u2019s style of play comes at a cost. Sometimes he takes as good as he gives, leaving Casey to lament missed calls like when Biyombo, at the end of Saturday\u2019s game, went down after a blow to the groin area.Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue was diplomatic when asked Sunday if he expected Dahntay Jones to receive supplemental discipline on the play. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Lue said of the incident.Saturday\u2019s loss was the first of the post-season for the Cavs, who had won 10 straight to open the playoffs.\u201cTrust me, we were not in the mood that we wanted to be in (Saturday) night,\u201d Cleveland veteran Richard Jefferson said of the post-game mood. \u201cA lot of us all went out to dinner together, and that\u2019s the first time in a month the dinner conversation wasn\u2019t joyous and excited and having fun. It was a night where we were just kind of talking about the things that we needed to do.\u201cWe were trying to keep our minds off of it, but you could see that everybody was a little off.\u201dA happy Biyombo is squarely in the Raptors good books these days. DeRozan confessed he told Biyombo of his negative feelings and that his feelings have come full circle.\u201cNow by far he\u2019s one of my favourite teammates of all time,\u201d he said with a smile.Biyombo confirmed the story.\u201cHe actually told me that personally, that he really hated me, until he got to know me as a person, and then he turned out to love me. I\u2019m sure there was a lot of feeling-out there, but until you really get to know the real side of me, then you know who I am. But on the floor I don\u2019t have friends.\u201d\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tBiyombo, who signed with Toronto in the off-season, makes US$2.8 million this season. He has a player option for next season, meaning he could hit a contract jackpot.DeRozan pointed to Biyombo\u2019s willingness to work for the team.\u201cHe never asks for the ball. He just wants to do all the dirty work for us, set the screens, getting rebounds, blocking shots, and when he gets going, he gets to point in the air doing the finger thing, that kind of gets us going. That kind of fuels us to keep playing hard. The spirit he has out there is amazing.\u201dCasey cited his team\u2019s compete level in the Game 3 win. DeRozan talked about pride, shaking his head at idle chatter the playoffs have produced.\u201cEspecially when you see headlines and things being said. You really sit there and wonder where do you all get this from,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do these people get these suggestions and allegations from?\u201cIt\u2019s crazy just to see it some time because people don\u2019t realize how sick or upset we be after a loss and especially how we lost the first two games (to Cleveland). We felt embarrassed. We knew that wasn\u2019t us. To see things like that is definitely frustrating and the only way to shut it up is to go out there and play.\u201dKyle Lowry, the other half of Toronto\u2019s $25-million backcourt, found himself in the crosshairs after going to the dressing room briefly during the first half of Game 2. What was either a bathroom break or mental pause suddenly ratcheted into unwarranted speculation in some quarters that Lowry had quit on the team.Casey said Valanciunas (ankle) was back on the court but offered no timetable for his return.', u'Canada beats Finland 2-0, wins world hockey championshipMOSCOW \u2013 Connor McDavid\u2019s first goal of the world hockey championship proved to be golden.McDavid\u2019s goal in the first period stood as the winner as Canada successfully defended its world championship title with a 2-0 win over Finland in the tournament final.The 19-year-old Edmonton Oilers centre had registered eight assists in the first nine games of the tournament, but was one of just two Canadian forwards not to have recorded a goal coming into the gold-medal game.McDavid ended his drought at the 11:24 mark of the first period, driving to the net and deking out sprawling Finnish netminder Mikko Koskinen.Matt Duchene added an empty-net goal with one second left on the clock to seal the win.\t\t\t\n\t\tCam\xa0Talbot made 16 saves for his tournament-leading fourth shutout.Canada came ready to play on Sunday, registering the first seven shots of the game before the Finns fought back with several good chances late in the first period.Talbot, determined to bounce back from a sub-par personal performance in a 4-0 loss to Finland in the preliminary round, made big saves on Patrik Laine, Jussi Jokinen and Jarmo Koskiranta to help send the Canadians into their dressing room with a one-goal lead at the end of 20 minutes.In a hard-hitting second period, Canada outshot the Finns by a margin of 13-4. The best Finnish chances came with Mark Scheifele serving a slashing penalty late in the period, when Talbot stopped Koskiranta on the doorstep, then denied Laine as he shot the puck while streaking down the right wing.In the third, Canada took a page from the playbook of the Finns, who had allowed just eight goals in nine games heading into the final. Canada shut down the opposition with strong defensive play, limiting quality Finnish scoring chances.Koskinen made 31 saves for the Finns.Finland came into the final undefeated with a 9-0 record and had a chance to become the first nation ever to win the world under-18 championship, world junior championship and world championship in the same year, but fell one game short.Canada is the first repeat gold medallist at the world championship since Russia won back-to-back titles in 2008 and 2009. Canada\u2019s last back-to-back wins came in 2003 and 2004.With his new gold medal around his neck, Canadian captain Corey Perry became the 27th player to join the esteemed Triple Gold Club, adding a world championship gold medal to his two Olympic golds from 2010 and 2014 and his 2007 Stanley Cup. Perry also won gold at the 2005 world junior championship.Perry joined an elite group of Canadian hockey players including Sidney Crosby, Patrice Bergeron, Jonathan Toews, Chris Pronger, Scott Niedermayer, Brendan Shanahan, Joe Sakic and Rob Blake.In the bronze-medal game earlier on Sunday, Russia got three points each from Sergei Mozyakin, Artemi Panarin and Pavel Datsyuk in a 7-2 rout of the United States.Panarin said Russia had played with more freedom after a weight of expectation was lifted following its semifinal defeat to Finland on Saturday.\u201cI think we just relaxed today,\u201d said Panarin, a Calder Trophy finalist. \u201cUntil now \u2026 the pressure was serious.\u201dThe U.S. led 30-29 in shots, but Russian goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky produced some impressive saves to protect the lead.Frank Vatrano scored both goals for the U.S.\u201cThis one stings. Obviously, you don\u2019t like to go out on a losing note,\u201d forward Nick Foligno said. \u201cThey just played off their emotion and their power and we didn\u2019t really have an answer.\u201d', u'#LeFlop and #Elbowgate: Sports and politics intersect on the internetToronto Raptors fans took to Twitter during Game 3 of the final against the Cleveland Cavaliers to mock LeBron James, who was knocked down during an altercation in the middle of the game.The Raptors went The commotion started in the second quarter, when Toronto\u2019s Bismack Biyombo was upset about not getting a foul call after a hit.Other players joined in, but it ended when the Cavs\u2019 Tristan Thompson\u2019s elbow came up and hit James in the face, sending him to the ground.Fans called foul on the fall, saying James was overreacting.But they were quick to point out a comparison: the basketball court looked a lot like the House of Commons this week.#Elbowgate started trending Wednesday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau physically pulled the Conservative whip through the House, elbowing NDP MP Ruth-Ellen Brosseau.', u'89-year-old Holocaust survivor sings U.S. anthem at Detroit Tigers gameDETROIT \u2013 An 89-year-old Holocaust survivor has fulfilled her longtime wish to sing the U.S. national anthem at a Major League Baseball game.Hermina Hirsch sang Saturday at Comerica Park in Detroit before the Detroit Tigers played Tampa Bay.The Czechoslovakia native lives in Southfield, Michigan. She was 17 when her family was split up and sent to concentration camps in 1944. According to her granddaughter, Andrea Hirsch, Hermina Hirsch and her older sister were shuffled between five concentration camps, including Auschwitz.

He was big-time tonight. Without him, we probably wouldn\u2019t get this win.\u201dDeRozan scored 32 points, while Cory Joseph had 14, and DeMarre Carroll and Patrick Patterson finished with 10 apiece.But the brick wall that is Biyombo, who wagged a finger like Dikembe Mutombo on his four blocked shots, was the Raptors\u2019 motor, thriving on the energy of the Air Canada Centre crowd and giving it back to them in spades.\u201cHe\u2019s just kind of the spirit of our team,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said.When the 23-year-old scored three consecutive baskets during a key late stretch for Toronto, Biyombo made like Usain Bolt in celebration. He waved his massive arms to get the crowd cheering.They needed little prompting.\u201cIt felt like (Biyombo) got every rebound out there, the energy he brings is unbelievable,\u201d Joseph said.\t\t\t\n\t\tLeBron James scored 24 points to top the Cavs, who went 10-0 to open the post-season, two shy of San Antonio\u2019s NBA record set in 1999.The Raptors are considered big underdogs against the Cavs, they\u2019d lost their two opening games in Cleveland by a combined 50 points, and had been all but written off.But back in front of an ACC crowd of 20,207 fans \u2013 including country singer Shania Twain and retired NFL star Terrell Owens \u2013 Toronto shrugged off the fatigue of what\u2019s been a gruelling post-season schedule and painstakingly put together an 18-point lead by the second quarter. A three-point buzzer-beater by Joseph sent them into the fourth with an 80-70 advantage.The Raptors missed eight straight shots in the middle of an ugly fourth quarter to allow the Cavs to pull within eight points, but Biyombo\u2019s three straight buckets had them back up by 14 with 3:38 to play.With the Air Canada Centre crowd on its feet as the clock ticked down, Lowry drilled a three with a minute on the clock that was bonus points on a game that was all but over.Biyombo said he \u201cgot the license\u201d to use the finger wag from Mutombo.\u201cHe was telling me how I haven\u2019t given you permission to use my finger yet,\u201d Biyombo said, flashing a wide smile. \u201cBut I love him. He\u2019s like my big brother, and I\u2019ve had several conversations about him, especially defensively, how he was able to impact the game.\u201cOf course once he gave me permission to use his finger wag, then I guess I just want to leave his legacy and make sure that I show him some love as my big brother.\u201dCavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said he wasn\u2019t bothered by Biyombo\u2019s wag.\u201cThey were kicking our butts, so he should have the right to wave his finger until we do something about it,\u201d Lue said.The Raptors\u2019 defence held the Cavs to 35 per cent shooting, while shooting 46 per cent themselves. They dominated the boards 54-40, and outscored the Cavs 36-20 in the paint.James was the subject of some tense \u2013 and entertaining \u2013 moments late in the first half, when a skirmish broke out between Biyombo, Joseph and Tristan Thompson. Thompson inadvertently smacked James with a flailing elbow and the four-time NBA MVP hit the deck hard. Perhaps a bit too hard. Twitter lit up with Academy Award memes.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to sell a call,\u201d James said, when asked about the incident. \u201cI got hit with an elbow. I didn\u2019t know from my own teammate. So no \u2013 sell a call for what? That\u2019s it.

Canadian netminder Cam Talbot held off the American pressure the rest of the way, making 30 saves in total to help send the defending champions to Sunday\u2019s gold-medal game.Canada will play unbeaten Finland for the title. The Finns beat host Russia 3-1 in the early semifinal.Canada\u2019s Brendan Gallagher opened the scoring at 8:59 of the first period and Brad Marchand made it a two-goal game at 18:02. But the momentum changed in the second period as Auston Matthews, David Warsofsky and Tyler Motte scored within a span of 7:11 for the Americans.With Brassard serving a delay-of-game penalty, Matthews beat Talbot high to the glove side for his team-leading sixth goal of the tournament. Less than three minutes later, Warsofsky pulled the U.S. even before Motte converted a one-timer at 8:25.Derick Brassard tied the game on the power play at 15:30. He shot the puck into the gaping net as Kinkaid was forced out of position after a scramble in front of the net.U.S. defenceman Connor Murphy was assessed a minor penalty and 10-minute misconduct late in the second period after checking Canadian forward Mark Stone into the boards in front of the American bench.Stone, who had been tied for the team scoring lead entering the game, went to the locker-room favouring his left arm. He returned to the bench at the start of the third period.Kinkaid made 23 saves for the U.S.Finland shut out Canada 4-0 in their preliminary-round matchup last Tuesday.

Either way, the tournament gives the remaining junior players a final opportunity to leave an impression.\u201cThe biggest thing is you\u2019re getting the last look from the scouts, you\u2019re the last thing on their mind (before the NHL draft) and you can raise your stock,\u201d said D.J. Smith, who coached at three Memorial Cups before taking an assistant coaching job with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2015.Smith added: \u201cMaybe you go from unknown to signing (with an NHL team).\u201dThe 2016 Memorial Cup features the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies, London Knights, Brandon Wheat Kings and host Red Deer Rebels. There are 15 draft-eligible skaters listed on the NHL Central Scouting rankings between the four clubs, with London having the most with eight.Smith saw firsthand what a standout performance can do for a player when he guided the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s Oshawa Generals to their fifth Memorial Cup in franchise history last year.Goaltender Ken Appleby wasn\u2019t Oshawa\u2019s starter until his final season when he was 20 years old, spending two campaigns as the backup prior to the 2014-15 season. But he went 38-7-4 in 50 games with an OHL-best 2.04 goals-against average and .924 save percentage, won a league championship, and finally earned the attention of NHL teams after going undrafted the two previous seasons.He was named the most outstanding goalie at the Memorial Cup, finishing with a 37-save performance in a 2-1 overtime victory against Kelowna to win the tournament.Appleby was invited by St. Louis and New Jersey to attend prospect camps last summer, and eventually signed a three-year entry-level deal with the Devils as a free agent in October. He is currently part of their minor-league system.Another member of the Generals to make a statement at the 2015 Memorial Cup was forward Anthony Cirelli, who had to earn his way onto Oshawa at the beginning of the season as a walk on.Expected to play Junior A at the beginning of the year, Cirelli wound up the Memorial Cup hero by scoring both goals against Kelowna.Cirelli\u2019s efforts through the season, and an overtime winner for the national crown, helped him up to No. 67 on the NHL Central Scouting rankings heading into the 2015 draft. He was selected in the third round by the Tampa Bay Lightning and signed a three-year entry-level contract on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to be a part of something like that. . .the whole country and junior hockey is watching, no more (other) juniors to scout,\u201d said Smith.London\u2019s eight draft-eligible players at the Memorial Cup are defencemen Brandon Crawley, Olli Juolevi, Nicolas Mattinen and Victor Mete, forwards Cliff Pu, Max Jones and Matthew Tkachuk and goaltender Tyler Parsons.Rouyn-Noranda defenceman Jacob Neveau is eligible while Brandon has defenceman Kale Clague and forward Tanner Kaspick.

It would be game over for Toronto by then.The Raptors dropped a 108-89 decision in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference final debut.With the game tied at 46-46, a woeful three-minute stretch late in the second quarter proved lethal, and now the Raptors head back home facing the seemingly impossible task of digging out of a 2-0 hole against the hottest team in the playoffs.\u201cWhat\u2019s the old saying? The series doesn\u2019t start until you lose at home?\u201d coach Dwane Casey said, hopefully. \u201cThe first game was ugly, tonight was not pretty.

They did for the better part of a first half that saw the lead change hands 11 times.But over the final 3:25 of the first half, the Raptors let the game slip from their grasp.

The SEC says Mickelson made the trade the next day and reaped a profit of $931,000 that he used to help pay off the debt.Ceresney declined to spell out the rationale for not making Mickelson part of the criminal case, other than, \u201cWe bring charges based on the evidence and the law.\u201dThe case comes in the wake of a 2014 appeals court decision that made prosecuting people benefiting from inside tips more difficult. The ruling found that in order to be charged, there must be evidence a defendant had first-hand knowledge about the origins of the inside information.\u201cBasically everybody has to know everybody else\u2019s role in the scheme,\u201d said Anthony Sabino, an attorney specializing in white-collar legal issues and a business professor at St. John\u2019s University in New York.That may have been too high a hurdle for the prosecutors to surmount with Mickelson. He was allegedly tipped by Walters, but didn\u2019t necessarily know Walters\u2019 source of the information.Mickelson\u2019s management group issued a statement Thursday saying that he felt \u201cvindicated\u201d because prosecutors hadn\u2019t charged him with breaking securities laws. It added: \u201cHe takes full responsibility for the decisions and associations that led him to becoming part of this investigation.\u201dDavis, 67, who resigned from Dean Foods\u2019 board of directors last year, has already pleaded guilty in the case and is co-operating with the investigation, Bharara said at the news conference. Walters, 69, was arrested by the FBI in Las Vegas on Wednesday. He was scheduled for arraignment Thursday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas.In a statement, defence attorney Barry Burke called Walters \u2014 a multimillionaire who owns several golf courses and auto dealerships \u2014 \u201can American success story.\u201d The accusations, he added, \u201care based on erroneous assumptions, speculative theories and false finger-pointing.\u201dDavis\u2019 attorney, Christopher Clark, confirmed his client was co-operating, but declined further comment.From 2008 through 2012, the SEC said, Davis passed Walters highly confidential information on Dean Foods, including sneak previews of at least six of the company\u2019s quarterly earnings announcements and advance notice of the spin-off of its profitable subsidiary, WhiteWave Foods Co.In 2013, Davis also gave Walters inside information he\u2019d gotten from a group of investors who confidentially shared their plans to buy stock in Darden Restaurants Inc., the SEC said. Based on the tips, Walters reaped illegal trading profits and avoided losses of at least $40 million, according to the regulators.Prosecutors allege Walters gave Davis a prepaid cellular phone to use when passing tips, with instructions to use code words, like \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d to refer to Dean Foods, prosecutors said.The complaint alleges that Mickelson had placed bets with Walters before the stock tip, and that the golfer owed Walters money at the time of the trading. It says that two months later, Mickelson repaid Walters \u201cin part with the proceeds of his trading.\u201dIt did not say how much Mickelson owed.The complaint has the attention of the PGA Tour, which has a section in its player handbook related to gambling. One part of the regulation says that player shall not \u201cassociate with or have dealings with persons whose activities, including gambling, might reflect adversely upon the integrity of the game of golf.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re in the process of looking at and determining,\u201d tour spokesman Ty Votaw said Wednesday evening.The PGA Tour, unlike other sports, does not disclose any disciplinary matter. Asked if Mickelson could be in violation, Votaw said only that \u201cyou quoted the regulation accurately.\u201d It had no further comment.In May 2014, Mickelson confirmed that FBI agents investigating insider trading questioned him as he finished playing a round at the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio, and said he was co-operating with the investigation.\t\t\t\n\t\tMickelson, 45, was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2011. He has won 42 tour events, including five majors \u2014 three Masters, one PGA Championship and one British Open. Forbes put his earnings last year at $51 million.He has long had a reputation for being a gambler, though he has said he scaled back his habit after his son, Evan, was born in 2003.

(But) it\u2019s one game,\u201d said Raptors coach Dwane Casey. \u201cThis series is not over by any means. We have another game on another night.\u201cThe score is embarrassing, but again, it\u2019s just one game.\u201d\xa0James punished the weary Raptors on 11-for-13 shooting, scoring on his first nine shots, and looking for most of the night like a man playing against boys.DeMar DeRozan had 18 points, but the rest of the Raptors could do little against a Cavaliers team that went into the night after a nine-day break. Bismack Biyombo had 12 points, while James Johnson finished with 10.\u201cWe\u2019re surely not going to make no excuses, but they\u2019ve been off their feet, we\u2019ve been battling for the last couple of weeks, and they came up with that. . . quick first step,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t meet it like we wanted to.\u201dThe Raptors hung in with the home team through the opening quarter, but almost as if they\u2019d been toying with Toronto, the Cavaliers then thrust a foot on the throat of the Raptors and held it there until the final, merciful, buzzer.When James blew past DeMarre Carroll for his massive windmill dunk that had the 20,562 fans roaring, it capped a 20-2 Cavaliers run and it was all but game over for Toronto already. Cleveland\u2019s 22-point lead in the second quarter became a whopping 28 points by the end of the third, as the Cavs took a 95-67 advantage into the fourth.Casey waved the virtual white flag with 10 minutes to play, pulling his starters for seldom-used Delon Wright and Jason Thompson.When Terrence Ross went up for what should have been an easy dunk with six minutes to go, the ball bounced out, an apt metaphor on an ugly night. As the clock ticked down, fans erupted into chants of \u201cU-S-A!\u201dCleveland held Kyle Lowry, who scored 35 points in Toronto\u2019s Game 7 win over Miami, to just eight. Neither Lowry nor DeRozan went to the free throw even once on the night.\u201cJust us being more aggressive,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come out the gate with that mindset, being aggressive like we usually do, and I think we didn\u2019t try to do that until later on in the game.\u201dThe Cavs outrebounded Toronto 45-23, and while they\u2019d been burning opponents from three-point range in these playoffs, they instead attacked from close range, clobbering Toronto 56-36 in the paint.\u201cIt\u2019s our preparation,\u201d James said of Cleveland\u2019s unblemished post-season. \u201cWe understand the moment and guys are rising to that.\u201dThe Cavaliers\u2019 straight-line drives to the net were \u201cdemoralizing,\u201d a somber Casey said after the blowout.\u201cVery demoralizing. You want to take away one thing (three-point shooting), but you don\u2019t want to open up a whole can of worms to give them layups, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to be disciplined with.\u201dThe 31-point win is the most lopsided in Cleveland\u2019s post-season history.Game 2 is Thursday in Cleveland, then the series shifts to the Air Canada Centre for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday.The Raptors had a 2-1 edge over the Cavs in the regular-season series. But Cleveland has been red-hot in the post-season, making quick work of Detroit and Atlanta in the first two rounds, and relegating the Raptors to the under-dog role.The Cavaliers\u2019 two sweeps allowed them a nine-day break, while the battle-wearing Raptors arrived in Cleveland to play just two days after finally knocking off Miami in Game 7 of the conference semifinals. They also needed seven games to dispatch Indiana in the first round.\u201cWe didn\u2019t rest,\u201d James shot back, when asked about the long break. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have a game. Coach gave us one day off, other than that we were in the gym. So we didn\u2019t rest. We just didn\u2019t have a game in front of the cameras.\u201dQuicken Loans Arena was awash in gold, with small pockets of Raptors fans. Montreal Canadiens star P.K. Subban had a front row seat, as did UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic.Casey had wanted his team to come out \u201cguns a-blazing,\u201d and they did with an early 7-0 lead. Still, DeRozan\u2019s 12 points in the first quarter weren\u2019t enough against the Cavs, who led 33-28 going into the second.The Cavs promptly found another gear and an Iman Shumpert dunk had them up by 19 just five minutes into the frame. Cleveland went into halftime up 66-44. The Raptors\u2019 halftime deficit tied for the worst in their playoff history.', u'Rougned Odor\u2019s minor league team introduces drink with punch to itFRISCO, Texas \u2013 Rougned Odor\u2019s former minor league team has introduced an alcoholic energy drink it says delivers a punch.The Double-A Frisco RoughRiders introduced \u201cRougie\u2019s Red PUNCH\u201d on Tuesday, the same day Major League Baseball suspended the Texas Rangers second baseman eight games for punching Toronto\u2019s Jose Bautista in the jaw.

Hale was serving as acting manager at the time of the incident and received standard discipline for the intentional actions of Chavez while warnings were in effect, MLB said.The bad blood between the two sides began last season AL Division Series with Bautista\u2019s infamous bat flip and came to a head on Sunday in Texas.In the eighth inning, Rangers 30-year-old rookie Matt Bush hit Bautista with a pitch, in a move which Gibbons said was retaliation.Bautista then slid dangerously hard into second base in an attempt to break up a double play and when he jumped to his feet, , causing the Jays slugger\u2019s hat and glasses to go flying.Gibbons was suspended because he had been ejected in the third inning for arguing balls and strikes with the umps before returning to the field in the ensuing melee.Five Texas players were fined including pitcher Matt Bush (intentionally throw at Bautista), pitcher Sam Dyson (aggressive actions), pitcher A.J.

Nine years, five straight Finals appearances, four MVP awards and two championship rings later, James is again on the doorstep of the league\u2019s showcase event.It\u2019s all new to Lowry, one of Toronto\u2019s All-Star guards, and the Raptors.Experience is just one advantage the Cavs will enjoy when they open the East finals Tuesday night against the Raptors, who have scratched their way through two Game 7s in this post-season and are on their deepest playoff run.And although the Cavs are recharged following a nine-day break between playoff series and have been in this spot before, James doesn\u2019t think his or Cleveland\u2019s post-season resume gives them any edge.\u201cIt\u2019s not an advantage,\u201d James said after practice Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re here for a reason. You got to go out and play. They also played two seven-game series and we didn\u2019t. So they can have the upper edge on that. So, there\u2019s no advantage to either team. Both teams are 0-0 and it\u2019s the first to four.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tThe Cavs have yet to go five games in this post-season, completing four-game sweeps over Detroit and Atlanta. James has been his usual dominant self, averaging 23.5 points, 8.8 rebounds and 7.3 assists. But unlike last year when Cleveland lost Kevin Love in the first round to a shoulder injury and Kyrie Irving went down with a broken kneecap in the Finals, James isn\u2019t on his own, which is why the Cavs are an overwhelming favourite to make their second straight trip to the title round.And as if the Raptors didn\u2019t have enough to worry about, Lowry, who scored 35 points in Toronto\u2019s series-clinching win over Miami, has already taken a swipe at James.Asked during an on-court interview Sunday about the upcoming matchup with the Cavs, Lowry said, \u201cLeBron\u2019s probably one of the best players in the league \u2013 besides Steph (Curry).\u201dProbably?\t\t\t\n\t\tJames, who last week said he felt Curry deserves to be this year\u2019s MVP but questioned the meaning of the award, said he\u2019s not offended, offering \u201cnone taken,\u201d when presented with Lowry\u2019s comment. Still, Lowry\u2019s slight \u2013 unintentional or not \u2013 may provide the Cavs with some extra motivation, not that they seem to need any.The Raptors will be without centre Jonas Valanciunis in Game 1 and maybe for the entire series. The 7-footer is still recovering from a sprained right ankle sustained in Game 3 against the Heat, and his loss damages Toronto\u2019s depth and rebounding.Some other things to watch when the Raptors, who beat Cleveland twice during the season, try to dethrone the defending conference champions:HAIL THE KING: Raptors coach Dwane Casey came to Lowry\u2019s defence on Monday, saying the comment about James is being overblown.\u201cWhoever is making a big deal about that has nothing else to write about,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing but respect in our locker room and our organization for LeBron James. The respect that we have for him and the respect I know I have for him and our staff has for him is unprecedented.\u201cIn my heart I feel like LeBron James is the best player in the NBA right now. They didn\u2019t ask me for my vote so I didn\u2019t give it to them.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tBIG-TIME BIYOMBO: The injury to Valanciunis, Toronto\u2019s best interior player, gave backup Bismack Biyombo more playing time and the Congolese player has delivered.The 23-year-old scored 17 points with 16 rebounds and two monster dunks in Game 7 against Miami. The Cavs know they\u2019ll need to account for him.\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy that\u2019s a spark for their team,\u201d Love said. \u201cHe runs the floor, cleans the glass on both ends and he\u2019s really been the X-factor for them that got them over the hump.\u201dTHREE-POINT CIRCUS: The Cavs made 77 3-pointers in their sweep over the Hawks, dropping an NBA record 25 in Game 2. Atlanta chose to protect the paint with defenders and paid for it. Casey said stopping Cleveland\u2019s outside game is crucial.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re such a great transition team, such a great penetrate, pick-and-roll team that you try to stop everything and you don\u2019t stop anything. We have to pick our poison. They\u2019re very lethal.\u201dWE THE NORTH: As a Canadian, Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson understands what Toronto\u2019s playoff run means to a hockey-obsessed nation getting more familiar with the hardwood.\u201cFor Canada, it\u2019s huge,\u201d said Thompson, who is from Brampton, Ontario. \u201cBasketball has definitely grown a lot in my country, so for the Raptors to be able to make it to the Eastern Conference finals, popularizes the game more. It\u2019s great for Toronto and the country as a whole.\u201d', u'Durant, Westbrook power Thunder past Warriors 108-102OAKLAND, Calif. \u2013 Kevin Durant scored 26 points and made a key 17-foot jumper with 30.7 seconds left, and the Oklahoma City Thunder handed the Golden State Warriors their first home loss of the playoffs with a 108-102 victory in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals Monday night.Russell Westbrook scored 24 of his 27 points in the second half for Oklahoma City, which trailed 60-47 at halftime. Westbrook also had 12 assists and seven steals in the opener of the Thunder\u2019s fourth West finals in six years.\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to compete,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough game. It\u2019s a tough building. They have a lot of great players on their team, but I know we\u2019re a great team and when we put our minds to it, tonight we didn\u2019t play our best game and we came out with a win.\u201dGame 2 is Wednesday night at Oracle Arena. If this one was any kind of preview of what is coming, this should be a dandy of a series between the NBA\u2019s highest-scoring teams from the regular season.Steven Adams made a pair of free throws for Oklahoma City with 1:01 remaining, and Klay Thompson missed a reverse lay-in moments later on the other end.MVP Stephen Curry had 26 points and a playoff career-high 10 rebounds, but the Warriors missed too many shots down the stretch.With his team down 105-102, Steve Kerr begged for a travelling call on Westbrook at midcourt with 17.2 seconds left, with the NBA Coach of the Year signalling with his arms before going into a squat. Oklahoma City got a timeout instead. Westbrook made one free throw with 14.5 seconds to go.Thompson scored 19 of his 25 points in the first half, but shot 3 for 10 over the last two quarters. Curry\u2019s 3-pointer to beat the halftime buzzer gave Golden State a 13-point lead at the break.Durant scored to get his team within 88-85 going into the final quarter, and then knocked down a tying 3 just 12 seconds into the fourth. Dion Waiters\u2019 layup at 10:30 put the Thunder ahead for the first time since the opening quarter.Westbrook missed nine of his first 10 shots before finding a groove and scoring 19 points in his team\u2019s 38-point third quarter. His jumper with 5:03 left pulled Oklahoma City to 73-68 before Thompson answered two possessions later. Westbrook stole the ball from Green and drove the length of the court for a dunk at the 3:07 mark of the third, and that helped swing momentum.Durant, Serge Ibaka and Adams each had double-digit rebounds \u2014 a focal point for Golden State after the Warriors won 121-118 in overtime on Curry\u2019s long game-winner at Oklahoma City on Feb. 27 despite being outrebounded 62-32.Westbrook took a hard hit to the face by Andrew Bogut for a foul ruled a Flagrant 1 after a review at the 5:37 mark of the first quarter. Trainers checked Westbrook\u2019s mouth.Curry was 9 for 22 from the field, including a 6-for-14 performance from beyond the arc, and committed seven turnovers to go with seven assists. He hit a 3-pointer in his 45th straight playoff game, breaking Reggie Miller\u2019s record set from 1995-2000.This marked the unanimous MVP\u2019s second straight start since coming off the bench in Game 4 against the Trail Blazers following a right knee sprain that still isn\u2019t 100 per cent. He said he can manage just fine, it\u2019s just about \u201cpain tolerance\u201d going forward.It also marked the first playoff matchup between Oklahoma City and the Warriors, though Golden State lost a first-round series 3-1 to the franchise when it was the Seattle SuperSonics in 1992.Bogut started but didn\u2019t score after returning to practice Sunday from a strained muscle in his right leg between the groin and hamstring that he injured in last Wednesday\u2019s Game 5 clincher against Portland.Curry and Thompson were the highest-scoring duo in the NBA, averaging 52.2 points, while Durant and Westbrook were a close second at 51.7.Thompson has scored 20 or more points in eight straight playoff games, the longest such streak by a Warriors player since Tim Hardaway\u2019s 12 games in a row from 1991-92.Westbrook\u2019s 19 third-quarter points were the most Golden State allowed to an opposing player in a quarter this post-season.Thunder: Oklahoma City won on the Warriors\u2019 home floor for the first time in six games since a 116-97 victory on April 11, 2013. \u2026 The Thunder outrebounded the Warriors 158-118 in the three regular-season games and 52-44 Monday.Warriors: Thompson made three 3-pointers, ending his streak with at least five 3s at seven playoff games. \u2026 Golden State had its streak of seven straight Game 1 playoff wins snapped with its first such defeat since dropping Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals to the Spurs in 2013. \u2026 The Warriors dropped to 6-1 at home this post-season. \u2026 Curry passed Paul Arizin (1,145) for third-most playoff points in franchise history.', u'Raptors coach Dwane Casey says rest will be Cavaliers\u2019 advantageCLEVELAND \u2013 It was a seven-game drag \u2019em out series that featured a slew of injuries and had coach Dwane Casey comparing it to a boxing match.And now, just two days after finally knocking out the Miami Heat in a gruelling NBA Eastern Conference semifinal, the Toronto Raptors take the court against the well-rested Cavaliers.The Raptors tip off their first-ever conference final on Tuesday in Cleveland, against a Cavs team that has enjoyed a nine-day break.\u201cWe have to go in with our guns a-blazing, playing hard and playing to our identity, and let the chips fall where they may.\u201dThe Raptors went the full seven games in each of the first two rounds of the playoffs, capped by their thrilling 116-89 victory over Miami on Sunday.Top-ranked Cleveland has yet to lose in the post-season, sweeping Detroit and then Atlanta.The Raptors have recent history on their side. They won the regular-season series against the Cavs 2-1, and saw big games from Kyle Lowry. Toronto\u2019s scrappy point guard averaged 31 points on 66 per cent shooting, and had the highest player efficiency rating of anyone who played at least 10 minutes a game against the Cleveland in the regular season.But the post-season has been costly. Toronto lost starting centre Jonas Valanciunas to a badly sprained ankle in Game 3 against Miami. Casey confirmed he won\u2019t play in Game 1 and is unlikely to return for Game 2.The Lithuanian big man is still limping badly, making it tough to see him returning at all in this series.Without the starting centre\u2019s post-up presence, the Raptors will have their hands full with Canadian Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov.DeMar DeRozan is also battling a thumb injury that requires wrapping during every timeout to relieve the swelling by the team\u2019s sport science guru Alex McKechnie and his famous red shoelace.DeMarre Carroll, who was acquired last summer for his defensive intensity, was huge in containing Dwyane Wade and Joe Johnson in Toronto\u2019s do-or-die Game 7. But he faces a mammoth task in containing Cavs star LeBron James. He also missed more than half the season with a knee injury, and then sprained a wrist in Game 5 against Miami.\u201cHe\u2019s still kind of feeling his way as we go offensively, but his hustle, his hard play, his timely three-point shots are a big part of what we need and why we signed him,\u201d Casey said. \u201cHe\u2019s exactly what we need at that position, to guard some of the power threes in this league.\u201dThe Raptors will be in tough to defend Cleveland\u2019s three-point shooting. The Cavs hit 77 threes in their four-game sweep of Atlanta. The Raptors, on the other hand, were second last in defending the three in the regular season.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be an issue,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThey\u2019re such a great transition team, such a great pick and roll team that if you try to stop everything, you can\u2019t stop anything. We have to pick our poison. They\u2019re a lethal team right now, one through five.\u201dBut while the Cavaliers are widely favoured to win the series, Casey\u2019s not buying it.\u201cEvery time you walk on the floor you\u2019ve got to give yourself a chance. We\u2019re humble but we\u2019re hungry. I do believe we\u2019ll play hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go in confident against what I feel is the best team in the league right now as far as playing together, playing both ends of the floor, shooting the three-ball.\u201cIn my mind, LeBron James is the best player in the league. He does so many things for his team offensively and defensively. (But) I have no doubt that our team will compete and play hard.\u201dSeveral hundred Raptors fans are expected to make the trip from Toronto for Game 1. Game 2 is Thursday, then the series returns to the Air Canada Centre for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday.', u'Nintendo plans to sell stake in Seattle Mariners, get into movie businessTOKYO \u2013 Japanese video game maker  is eyeing the movie business for growth.Company spokesman Makoto Wakae said Monday details are undecided but the work might be a theatre release or a DVD.Nintendo, which makes the Wii U home console and Nintendo 3DS hand-held machine, has licensed its game characters in the past, such as with its Pokemon movies, but it is now thinking about make its own film content.It won\u2019t become a full-fledged film studio, but filmmaking is one area it has chosen for future investment of proceeds from selling its stake in the major league Seattle Mariners, planned for later this year, according to Kyoto-based Nintendo.The Japanese daily newspaper Asahi reported Monday that Nintendo\u2019s work might be 3-D animation. It said Nintendo is in talks with various film companies on a possible partnership.Wakae said an announcement will be made, but even the details of the Mariners sale have not yet been announced.Nintendo has seen its growth stagnate in recent eyes amid competition from smartphones and other devices, and films could revive interest in its franchise, which also includes .Nintendo reported a 24 billion yen ($216 million) loss for January-March, bigger than the loss it reported the previous year.

The deal is subject to approval by Major League Baseball, expected during league meetings in August.\xa0', u'WATCH: Simmering Toronto-Texas feud erupts in brawlARLINGTON, Texas \u2013 Jose Bautista slid hard into second base, stood up and found himself face-to-face with Texas\u2019 Rougned Odor.Next thing the Toronto slugger knew, he was rattled by a right jab to the jaw that sent his batting helmet and sunglasses flying.A feud simmering since Bautista\u2019s bat flip in last year\u2019s AL Division Series boiled over into a wild brawl that ultimately triggered six of the eight ejections in the Blue Jays\u2019 7-6 loss on Sunday.\u201cI was pretty surprised,\u201d Bautista said.Perhaps it\u2019s a good thing the Rangers and Blue Jays have played for the final time this season. As for the playoffs, well, that would be interesting.Texas is headed to Oakland, and the Blue Jays back home to Toronto, the site of last year\u2019s emotional meeting in the playoffs. That\u2019s when Bautista capped a wild seventh inning with a clutch three-run homer and the monumental bat flip that angered Texas.This time, Bautista was upset by getting hit by an eighth-inning pitch from 30-year-old Texas rookie Matt Bush (1-0), who got his first major league win two days after his debut \u2013 and 12 years after he was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft.Toronto manager John Gibbons, who was ejected in the third inning over an argument about balls and strikes, came back to the field for the brawl.He suggested the Rangers were finally retaliating for Bautista\u2019s bat flip in the eighth inning of the last of seven games between the teams this season. Texas beat Toronto in a series for the first time since 2012, but the Blue Jays had a 4-3 edge for the season.\u201cIt was ugly and unfortunate,\u201d Gibbons said.Crew chief Dale Scott told a pool reporter that Gibbons\u2019 return \u201cwill be in the report and Major League Baseball will take care of it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to sit here and drink too much wine,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cYa got to go out there. I\u2019m sure the league will say something about that but it\u2019s kind of the manager\u2019s responsibility.\u201dBautista, who was kept out of most of the melee by a bear hug from Texas veteran Adrian Beltre, was ejected as a result of the brawl. Same for Odor \u2013 who shoved Bautista before punching him \u2013 along with Toronto\u2019s Josh Donaldson and Texas bench coach Steve Buechele.After the field was finally cleared, Blue Jays reliever Jesse Chavez hit Prince Fielder with the next pitch when the game resumed. He was ejected automatically because of the warning issued after Bush hit Bautista.Blue Jays bench coach Demarlo Hale also was tossed because of Chavez\u2019s pitch because he was filling in for Gibbons.Toronto first base coach Tim Leiper was ejected in the third inning in a separate dispute before Gibbons was tossed.\u201cI think it was just two hard-nosed baseball teams that play the game hard,\u201d said Texas manager Jeff Banister, who exchanged words with Gibbons as the field was being cleared.Odor wasn\u2019t available to reporters after the game.Ian Desmond greeted Chavez (0-1) with a three-run homer with two outs in the seventh, giving Texas a 7-6 lead with a drive to the seats above the tall wall in left field.Bautista\u2019s brawl-triggering slide forced Odor to throw wildly to first on an attempted double play on a grounder by Justin Smoak, but Texas was awarded an inning-ending double play on the Chase Utley rule.Sam Dyson, who gave up Bautista\u2019s memorable homer in last year\u2019s playoffs, pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.Bautista gave Toronto a 5-2 lead with a three-run double in the sixth. Troy Tulowitzki had three hits and scored two runs.\xa0', u'Raptors beat Heat 116-89 in Game 7, advance to Eastern Conference finalTORONTO \u2013 The Toronto Raptors have made history.And now they head into uncharted territory \u2013 the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 21 years.Raptors\u2019 all-star Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan combined for 63 points in a thorough 116-89 dismantling of the Miami Heat in Sunday\u2019s thrilling do-or-die Game 7 of their conference semifinals.Lowry had 35 points while DeRozan chipped in with 28, playing with the heart and hustle Raptors fans had seen so many times in Toronto\u2019s 56-win regular season. And they got plenty of help, as Bismack Biyombo had 16 rebounds to go with 17 points, DeMarre Carroll chipped in with 14 points, and Patrick Patterson had 11 points and 11 boards.Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic scored 16 points apiece for Miami.In a fierce back-and-forth series that saw three overtime games, and a slew of injuries, Sunday\u2019s thrilling finale saw the Raptors lead most of the way. They battled hard on both ends of the floor with a ferocity they hadn\u2019t shown in this series, and opened up a 17-point lead in a solid third quarter.They went into the fourth ahead 86-78, and when Biyombo muscled his way in for a monstrous dunk \u2013 and Usain Bolt celebration \u2013 then Carroll drilled a three and the delirious Air Canada Centre crowd went nuts.Things got heated when Biyombo and Josh McRoberts had to be separated, Biyombo furious after being clotheslined by the Heat forward. McRoberts was assessed a flagrant foul, and the incident only served to further fire up Toronto and its crowd.\t\t\t\n\t\tToronto could do little wrong down the stretch. By the time Patterson followed up a basket with a pair of free throws, the Raptors led by 20, and anxious Toronto fans could finally take a collective deep breath.Lowry drilled a three with 3:23 to play that followed up a basket by DeRozan, and the Raptors went up by a whopping 25 points. When the Raptors\u2019 all-stars left the game with two-and-a-half minutes to play, the crowd ushered them off the court with a standing ovation.A chant of \u201cWe want Cleveland!\u201d broke out in the dying seconds.Now the Raptors face the well-rested Cleveland Cavaliers in a be-careful-what-you-wish-for scenario. The Cavs host Toronto in Game 1 on Tuesday after a nine-day break, while Toronto has played eight games in 15 days.\xa0On Sunday, Toronto clobbered Miami on the boards 50-30, and outscored its opponent 27-9 in second-chance points.The Raptors had made the second round just one other time, in 2001, when they were a missed Vince Carter jumper from making the conference finals in a loss to Philadelphia.Toronto was the last NBA team to drop a Game 7 at home, in 2014, when Lowry\u2019s last-second shot was blocked in a loss to Brooklyn.The Raptors were one of four active NBA teams \u2013 the others are Charlotte, New Orleans and Los Angeles Clippers \u2013 to never play in the conference finals.The raucous crowd also included Montreal Canadiens\u2019 P.K. Subban, Toronto FC star striker Sebastian Giovinco, sprinter Andre De Grasse, and MMA fighter Michael (The Count) Bisping.The Heat had forced a Game 7 with a 103-91 victory on Friday in Miami.It was the second winner-takes-all game for Toronto in these playoffs, as they knocked out Indiana in a Game 7 in the opening round.\t\t\t\n\t\tThousands of fans braved the cold \u2013 and fittingly, lightly falling snow \u2013 to watch the game on the giant screen in Maple Leaf Square. Their cheers could be heard in nearby Union Station.The line to get in several hours earlier had snaked around the Air Canada Centre.Both teams looked tight to start, but sparked by 11 points from DeRozan, the Raptors took a 25-24 lead into the second quarter.Joe Johnson\u2019s personal 6-0 run put Miami up by a point midway through the second, but Lowry, with 12 points in the quarter, led the Raptors to a 53-47 lead at halftime.\xa0', u'Russia is \u2018very sorry\u2019 for doping, says sports ministerMOSCOW \u2013 Russia has a \u201cproblem\u201d with doping and is \u201cvery sorry\u201d that its cheating athletes were not caught sooner, the country\u2019s sports minister said.Russia, a track and field powerhouse, was suspended by the IAAF in November following a WADA panel report that found state-sponsored cheating.\u201cSerious mistakes have been made by the federation management, along with athletes and coaches who have broken anti-doping rules and neglected the principle of fair play,\u201d said Vitaly Mutko, writing in British newspaper The Sunday Times. \u201cLet us be clear. We are ashamed of them.\u201d\u201cWe are very sorry that athletes who tried to deceive us, and the world, were not caught sooner. We are very sorry because Russia is committed to upholding the highest standards in sport and is opposed to anything that threatens the Olympic values.\u201dMutko did not, however, admit any involvement in doping by the Russian government, a central charge in both November\u2019s WADA report and recent allegations that test samples were switched at the Sochi Olympics.Russia will discover on June 17 whether its athletics federation has met the reform criteria to return to competition in time for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\u201cWe have done everything that has been asked of us by the IAAF in order to be reinstated,\u201d Mutko added. \u201cIt would be unjust to demand all these changes and measures, witness them happen, and then still punish Russia\u2019s athletes.\u201dSetting out Russia\u2019s anti-doping reform agenda, Mutko said aspiring Olympians will undergo three anti-doping controls carried out by the IAAF, as well as any additional testing in qualifying competitions, and that its anti-doping agency in Moscow is being supervised by two \u201cinternational experts\u201d appointed by WADA last month.Mutko\u2019s contrition contrasts with his combative attitude in recent remarks for a Russian audience.Speaking last week to state news agency R-Sport, Mutko said that Vitaly Stepanov, a former anti-doping officer and key whistleblower whose evidence featured in the WADA report, \u201cwas chased out of (Russia) like a scoundrel\u201d and suggested he was part of a plot to smear Russia\u2019s reputation.Stepanov says he and his wife left Russia because they feared for their safety after disclosing details of performance-enhancing drug use and subsequent coverups.Russia was plunged into another doping scandal this week, when the former head of Moscow\u2019s anti-doping lab, Grigory Rodchenkov, detailed in The New York Times how Russia operated a state-sponsored scheme during the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 that included exchanging bottles of tainted urine samples for clean ones through a concealed hole in the wall of the Sochi lab. The doping program reportedly involved at least 15 Russian medal winners.Russian officials have denied the allegations and threatened to sue the newspaper. The World Anti-Doping Agency will investigate.', u'Controlled explosion at Old Trafford; Manchester United game cancelledMANCHESTER, England \u2013 A bomb disposal unit carried out a controlled explosion at Manchester United\u2019s Old Trafford stadium on Sunday after a suspect package was discovered before the Premier League game between United and Bournemouth.The dismantling of what police described as an \u201cincredibly lifelike explosive device\u201d came amid increased security at Premier League stadiums following last year\u2019s Paris attacks that targeted the Stade de France sports stadium as well as cafes, bars and a popular concert hall.However, nearly four hours after the evacuation, Greater Manchester Police announced that the suspect package was not a \u201cviable device.\u201d\u201cFull assessment now concluded and found device wasn\u2019t viable,\u201d the police force said on its Twitter page. \u201cA full search of the stadium is ongoing.\u201dMilitary personnel were dispatched to the stadium after the game was postponed following an evacuation of spectators from two stands about 30 minutes before the scheduled kickoff time of 3 p.m. local time (1400 GMT).Players from both teams were taken off the pitch during the warm-up and kept in the changing rooms. They were then let out while spectators were also being evacuated.\u201cWe are doing everything we can to investigate this item as quickly as possible, however our priority is obviously to ensure the safety of everyone in the stadium and surrounding area,\u201d said John O\u2019Hare, assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester Police.United said the package was \u201cfound in the North West Quadrant\u201d of Old Trafford, which has a capacity of more than 75,000 seats. Fans sitting in other stands initially had been allowed to stay inside the stadium.There was a strong police presence outside Old Trafford and fire engines attended the scene. Sniffer dogs were also seen inside the stadium.Greater Manchester Police said on its Twitter page that people should \u201cavoid the area if possible.\u201dThe match was one of 10 taking place on the final day of the Premier League season. The other nine matches went ahead.United was vying with Manchester City to finish in fourth place in the Premier League and qualify for the Champions League. City drew 1-1 at Swansea, effectively ending United\u2019s top-four chances.The Premier League said in a statement that it will look to rearrange the game \u201cas soon as practically possible.\u201d\u201cIt is always the last resort to abandon one of our fixtures and while we apologize for the inconvenience caused to fans, we are sure, in the circumstances, they will appreciate the need to do so,\u201d the Premier League said.\xa0The league said that \u201cwhen it comes to matters of security, it is obviously right that Manchester United and the Premier League place the safety of supporters and employees foremost.\u201dUnited is scheduled to play Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on Saturday.It is the first Premier League match to be postponed because of a bomb threat. An exhibition soccer game between Germany and the Netherlands was cancelled in November after police said they received a bomb threat. No explosives were immediately found.The most high-profile British sporting event to be postponed in similar circumstances was the Grand National horse race in Liverpool in 1997. On that occasion, an IRA bomb threat forced the evacuation of Aintree race course, where about 60,000 spectators were attending. The race was staged two days later.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'History on the line for Toronto Raptors in Game 7TORONTO \u2013 The Toronto Raptors are 48 minutes from rewriting their history.A victory over Miami in Sunday\u2019s do-or-die Game 7 will put the Raptors into the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference final for the first time in the team\u2019s 21 years.\u201cGames 7s are fun,\u201d said Casey. \u201cI tell our guys that these are the games you work all summer for. You prepare your body, you prepare your mind, you get through the regular season, you won 56 games, you earned the right to have Game 7 on your home court. Let\u2019s go out and play basketball and have fun competing.\u201cThere should be nothing else hanging over your head. There\u2019s no pressure except just going out and competing against the Miami Heat.\u201dThe Heat  with a 103-91 victory in Miami on Friday night.The Raptors also needed seven games to dispatch the Indiana Pacers in the opening round. The big difference in that series was the pressure hung thick over the team. The Raptors hadn\u2019t advanced to the second round in 15 years. The players were tight, Casey said, weighed down by the team\u2019s history and expectations.\u201cBut I don\u2019t sense that in this round,\u201d said Casey, who\u2019s coached in too many elimination games to count \u2014 he attempted during a conference call Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of understanding the moment. I think this Game 7 will be different than the last Game 7. I think our guys understand that. Going through the Indiana series helped them tremendously as far as getting through that.\u201dOn the eve of Game 7 against Indy, Kyle Lowry said that series finale would be \u201clike the Super Bowl. Win or go home. Survive or don\u2019t survive.\u201dLooking back, he agreed with Casey. The team was tight.The matchup marks the third Game 7 in three seasons for Toronto, who lost a heartbreaker to Brooklyn in the opening round in 2014, on a blocked Lowry shot at the buzzer.\u201cOur backs will be against the wall,\u201d Raptors forward DeMarre Carroll said.A well-rested Cleveland team awaits the winner. The Cavaliers, who swept both Detroit and Atlanta in their first two series, host Game 1 on Tuesday night after a nine-day break.The Raptors, on the other hand, will play their eighth game in a 15-day stretch of gruelling back-and-forth travel and several key injuries.DeMar DeRozan\u2019s sprained thumb requires wrapping from sports science guru Alex McKechnie and his now-famous red shoelace during timeouts, to help keep the swelling down. Jonas Valanciunas is out with a badly sprained ankle. Carroll is playing with a wrist injury.The good news is DeRozan and Lowry have rediscovered their all-star form. They\u2019re averaging a combined 42.7 points in the series. Lowry scored a game-high 36 points in Friday\u2019s loss, while DeRozan had 23.But Casey hopes that someone else steps up and produces a career night on what would be the biggest victory in franchise history.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be opportunities for guys to step up and have big nights,\u201d Casey said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you kind of need to get through a Game 7 is someone who Miami probably hasn\u2019t prepared for, someone to step out of the box and do something spectacular.\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what you hope for, to get that boost (from someone) other than Kyle and DeMar.\u201dCasey credited the raucous Air Canada Centre crowd for pulling his dog-tired players through Game 7 against Indiana. He hopes for more of the same Sunday.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be huge,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like having your fans behind you in a Game 7, when things kind of get down, they push you through, you know that they\u2019re cheering for you through thick and thin. We have one of the loudest arenas in the league, to go at the other team and build you up when you get tired, and fatigue sets in.\u201d', u'Dickey helps Blue Jays beat Rangers 5-0ARLINGTON, Texas \u2013 R.A.

In the fourth inning of the St. Louis-Anaheim game, an orange-and-white cat sprang onto the field and was seen sprinting from the Cardinals\u2019 dugout across the diamond.The nimble cat showed its agility, making it from first to third in less than five seconds, something that takes the average major-leaguer twice the time.\u201cMan, he is fast,\u201d the Fox Sports announcer said.After streaking across the field, the frantic cat jumped into the third base stands, forcing fans to their feet as it ran beneath the seats of several sections.Eventually a fearless Angels\u2019 fan in the front row grabbed the cat, paying no attention to the terrified tabby\u2019s claws.The cat was taken to a local adoption agency where they hope to find a new home for it.St. Louis benefitted from the \u201crally cat,\u201d beating Anaheim 12-10. ', u'Athletes starting to pull out of Rio Olympics over Zika fearsOlympic athletes have started to pull out of the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in August over fears of contracting the Zika virus.Earlier this week, Australian golfer Marc Leishman announced he will not compete in the Olympics over the potential health risk of contracting the Zika virus.\u201cLast April my children and I almost lost my wife Audrey to toxic shock syndrome. Since then, Audrey has been prone to infection and is far removed from 100 per cent recovery of her immune system,\u201d Leishman said in a statement through PGA Australia. \u201cWe have consulted with Audrey\u2019s physician and due to her ongoing recovery and potential risks associated with the transmission of the Zika virus it was a difficult yet easy decision not to participate.\u201dZika is a mosquito-borne virus that has been found to cause underdeveloped brains in babies born to women infected while pregnant. It\u2019s also potentially linked to neurological disorders in some infected children and adults.Leishman is the second Australian golfer to pull out of the Summer Olympics. Last month, Adam Scott, who ranks 7th in world PGA Tour rankings, cited a busy playing schedule as his reason for dropping out. However, the golfer did have concerns over the virus.\u201cI have not used it as an excuse although it would be very convenient to do so. It is only part of my concerns,\u201d Scott told the . \u201cI will say when the World Health Organisation has serious concerns over the impact that hundreds of thousands of people flooding into Rio is going to have I think we should listen.\u201dThis is the first time golf has returned to the Olympics since 1904.\u201cClearly traditional Olympic athletes are in a very awkward situation. They\u2019ve trained so hard for this and it is everything that they\u2019ve dreamed of and for a health epidemic to get in the way, I understand why they are still trying to go,\u201d Scott told the Australian newspaper. \u201cBut it has to be treated seriously and I just don\u2019t think it is. It hasn\u2019t really got major traction yet and I am amazed by that.\u201dEarlier this week LPGA Tour commissioner Mike Whan told the Associated Press he had a handful of players ask him about the Zika virus, but none have said they won\u2019t play because of the virus.\u201cI don\u2019t know any player who\u2019s even said, \u2018I\u2019m on the fence,\u2019\u201d Whan said. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of players at the age where this could be concerning, but I haven\u2019t heard any player say they\u2019re interested in stepping out.\u201dA Canadian professor of law and public health says the Summer Olympics should be postponed or moved to other venues because of the threat posed by the Zika virus epidemic.In an article published in the , Amir Attaran of the University of Ottawa, said the expected half million visitors to the Olympic and Paralympic Games pose a risk of spreading the virus once they return to their home countries.\u201cSimply put, Zika infection is more dangerous, and Brazil\u2019s outbreak more extensive, than scientists reckoned a short time ago. Which leads to a bitter truth: the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games must be postponed, moved, or both, as a precautionary concession,\u201d Attaran .The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) said it is monitoring the situation in Brazil.\u201cTeam Canada\u2019s medical team is monitoring all health risks in and around Rio in anticipation of the upcoming Games and is taking appropriate steps to ensure our athletes can compete without worries,\u201d the COC said in a statement to Global News. \u201cThe IOC continues to monitor the situation very closely and is working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to keep abreast of all developments.\u201cIn addition, WHO has issued a statement that, based on available evidence, there should be no general restrictions on travel and trade with countries, areas and/or territories with Zika virus transmission,\u201d the COC said.\u2013', u'Russian Olympic gold medalists deny doping claimsMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Two Olympic gold medalists from Russia denied doping Friday, a day after they were named in a newspaper report detailing state-sponsored cheating at the 2014 Sochi Games.Bobsled champion Alexander Zubkov and cross-country skier Alexander Legkov were among the athletes accused in a  article of \u201cWhat\u2019s written now in this article is baseless libel,\u201d Zubkov told Russian state TV, adding that he regularly gave doping samples in his career.The article also brought a strong response from the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman denounced the allegations as \u201ca turncoat\u2019s libel.\u201dGrigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Russian lab now living in Los Angeles, told the Times that he was given a spreadsheet of doping athletes by the Sports Ministry ahead of the games. It allegedly bore the names of 15 athletes who later won medals, including Zubkov and Legkov.The spreadsheet was not published and The Associated Press could not verify it.Rodchenkov said he then switched out tainted urine samples for clean ones at the doping lab used for the games in Sochi, with help from people he believed to be officers of the Russian security services.Legkov defended his \u201chonest medals\u201d and said Rodchenkov, who resigned as lab director last year following separate allegations that he covered up doping in track and field, was not a credible source.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why a person like this should be believed, trusted or anything else,\u201d Legkov said in televised comments.Zubkov and Legkov are two of Russia\u2019s most prominent winter sports athletes.Zubkov carried the Russian flag at the opening ceremony for the Sochi Olympics and won gold in the two-man and four-man bobsled events at the age of 39, becoming one of the oldest pilots to win an Olympic event.Legkov won gold in the men\u2019s 50-kilometer cross-country mass start on the last day of the games and was given his gold medal at the closing ceremony.Zubkov and Legkov later threatened to sue Rodchenkov for defamation, with Zubkov calling the accusations are \u201csimply lunacy.\u201dPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin rejects the accusations that the Russian government oversaw a state-sponsored doping program and subsequent cover-up.\u201cIt just seems like, you know, some kind of a turncoat\u2019s libel,\u201d Peskov said, without mentioning Rodchenkov by name. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put trust in such unfounded claims.\u201dThe government continues to back Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, Peskov added.The country\u2019s deputy sports minister, Yuri Nagornykh, said there is no way that Russia could have manipulated doping samples at the Sochi Games because of the presence of foreign observers.\u201c(Russia) did not have the opportunity to influence in any way the system of doping control procedures, storage and transport,\u201d Nagornykh said.The World Anti-Doping Agency is set to investigate Rodchenkov\u2019s allegations, and Rodchenkov himself has volunteered to identify which samples he tampered with.The International Olympic Committee on Thursday said that the \u201callegations are very detailed and very worrying and we ask the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate immediately.\u201dThe IOC said, based on the result of the WADA inquiry, that it \u201cwill not hesitate to act with its usual policy of zero tolerance for doping and defending the clean athletes.\u201d', u'Olympics to continue unchanged despite political crisis in BrazilRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The venues are, in the words of organizers, 99 percent ready. The torch is winding its way around the country in a three-month relay ending at the opening ceremony.Even if the country is preoccupied with the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, organizers insist the Olympics won\u2019t be touched by the ongoing political turmoil.Will that bear out? Stay tuned.Will a change in the country\u2019s chief executive cause more problems as the calendar ticks down to Rio? What about the effect of the country\u2019s rotating sports leadership?One of the first acts of interim president Michel Temer was to appoint Leonardo Picciani the new sports minister, the second in two months and the fourth in two years.\u201cThis will at least give Olympic organizers someone to talk to,\u201d said Sergio Praca, a Brazilian who studies politics at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. \u201cThis lack of command is very bad.\u201dRousseff\u2019s suspension answers at least one question.Temer is almost certain to represent Brazil and declare the games \u201copen\u201d on Aug. 5 at the Maracana Stadium, though organizing officials said he would not give a speech. Rousseff was jeered two years ago when she spoke at the opening of the World Cup.Traditional Olympic protocol calls for Nuzman and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach to do the speaking, lauding the games and the country.Even if the impeachment battle temporarily tapers off with Rousseff\u2019s suspension, Rio still faces myriad problems, making South America\u2019s first Olympics the most contentious in decades.\t\t\t\n\t\tBrazil is mired in the deepest recession since the 1930s, and it\u2019s at the epicenter of the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been proven to cause birth defects in newborn babies.The country is also gripped by a $3 billion corruption scandal at state-run oil giant Petrobras with many of the same construction companies working on Olympic projects.Other worries include slow ticket sales, $500 million cuts to balance the operating budget, and the death of two men last month when a newly built Olympic-legacy bike lane collapsed into the sea.The state of Rio de Janeiro has also chopped $550 million from its security budget (about 20 percent), a big worry since the state will provide about 65,000 of the 85,000 police and soldiers to patrol the games.\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that Brazil is in a very serious crisis,\u201d former Barcelona soccer great Romario, now a federal senator, said Wednesday during the impeachment vote. \u201cNo magic tricks will take us from this quagmire immediately.\u201dIn a statement Thursday, Bach said the IOC looks \u201cforward to working with the new government to deliver successful games in Rio this summer.\u201dThe IOC guides local organizers, providing templates from other games, timelines and expertise. A team of IOC inspectors made their final official visit to Rio a month ago, saying things were in place.\u201cDespite the hardships and hard economic conditions, they are on target,\u201d inspection team member Patrick Hickey of Ireland told the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different games but it will work.\u201dEven with the upbeat mood, Praca \u2013 the political analyst \u2013 said Brazil was apathetic toward the Olympics. The country is predicted to win about 25 medals this time \u2013 its best-ever showing and cracking the top 10 \u2013 but Olympic interest pales alongside soccer\u2019s World Cup.There is little evidence across Rio that the games are near; no advertising, few signs of Olympic paraphernalia and little talk about it.\u201cThe Olympics have always been a very secondary thing, like something that happened between World Cups,\u201d Praca said. \u201cI just don\u2019t really see people getting geared up for it like they do the World Cup.\u201dHe said the indifference reduced the chances for protests with the 10 percent unemployed \u2013 and 10 percent inflation \u2013 unlikely to blame the games for their woes.\u201cAt the Olympics, unlike the World Cup, you have a lot of events going on simultaneously,\u201d Praca said. \u201cAt the World Cup it was basically one game, one venue and an easy target to focus attention.\u201d\u2014APTV video reporter Diarlei Rodrigues contributed this report.', u'Canadian Olympic gold medallist Beckie Scott urges WADA to ensure Russians are drug-free in RioMONTREAL \u2013 Olympic gold medallist Beckie Scott gave a speech Thursday that reminded all the leaders at the World Anti-Doping Agency why they\u2019re doing all this work.Scott, the Canadian cross-country skier whose gold-medal celebration came years after the race because a doper beat her, told WADA\u2019s foundation board that athletes want the agency to use its influence to ensure Russia won\u2019t compete at the upcoming Olympics if there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019re clean.Scott said athletes want an expanded investigation into Russian sports, beyond track and field, and they want to know that when they line up in Brazil later this year, they\u2019ll be competing against clean athletes.\u201cWe put this call out in November, and were deeply disappointed with the lack of decisive action and follow-up,\u201d said Scott, who gave a similar speech at WADA\u2019s last big meeting, only to be rebuffed by agency leadership.Scott, the chair of the WADA athletes committee, said athletes understood the \u201cutter, complete implausibility of (Russia\u2019s doping system) being in place to just service track and field.\u201d\u201cThat the doping was so widespread and nothing was done is almost incomprehensible to the athletes\u2019 community,\u201d she said.This week, WADA agreed to investigate allegations, delivered by whistleblowers Vitaly and Yulia Stepanov, that four gold medallists from the Sochi Olympics used steroids.But before that revelation, the Russian investigation had focused on track and field, even though the leader of the investigation, Dick Pound, made it clear in his report that cheating wasn\u2019t confined to one sport.Scott outlined a four-item list of requests from athletes around the world, including that WADA use its influence to ban Russia from the Olympics.Also on the list: immediate penalties for those who violate anti-doping code in extraordinary cases; sanctions for serious noncompliance; and better methods to take care of whistleblowers.Scott said she understands that it\u2019s track\u2019s governing body, not WADA, that has final say on whether Russia\u2019s track team competes at the Rio Olympics. The IAAF will meet next month to determine Russia\u2019s future. But, Scott said, WADA can shape decisions and needs to use that power with respect to Rio.She criticized WADA\u2019s slow-moving investigation process, one the leadership is trying to improve.The Stepanovs sent dozens of emails to WADA from 2010-2014 but no action was taken until the information was given to a German TV network.\u201cIf we don\u2019t lead investigations, and not just follow up on TV programs, if we don\u2019t sanction, we lose athletes\u2019 belief in the system and lose the belief that winning clean is possible,\u201d Scott said.', u'Raptors take Game 5, beat Heat 99-91 to go up 3-2 in seriesTORONTO \u2013 For the first time in perhaps the entire post-season, Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both played like all-stars.And now the Toronto Raptors are one victory away from the NBA Eastern Conference final.DeRozan scored 34 points, while Lowry had 25 to lift the Raptors 99-91 over the Heat on Wednesday. They head back to Miami with a 3-2 lead in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals.A win in Friday\u2019s Game 6 and the Raptors will play in the Conference finals for the first time in the team\u2019s 21-year history.Dwyane Wade led Miami with 20.Bizmack Biyombo added 10 points for the Raptors, who played without defensive specialist DeMarre Carroll for the fourth quarter.Carroll fell hard on his left wrist, and was helped to the locker-room in considerable pain. X-rays were negative for what the team called a \u201cwrist contusion.\u201dIn what\u2019s turned into a series of attrition, the Raptors are without Jonas Valanciunas for the series (ankle), and DeRozan is battling a thumb injury. The Heat are missing starting centre Hassan Whiteside (knee).Lowry and DeRozan\u2019s solid shooting sparked an early 20-point Raptors lead, before the Heat cut it to 10 with a 16-2 run that straddled the second and third quarter.The Raptors headed into the fourth up 75-62, but back-to-back three-pointers from Josh Richardson cut the lead to seven points. DeRozan took a hard hit to his bad thumb, and made a beeline for the locker-room. But he returned with four minutes to play, to a warm ovation, and was huge in his return.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tWithout Carroll\u2019s defence down the stretch, Wade scored Miami\u2019s final eight points, and cut the Raptors\u2019 lead to one point with two minutes to play.But DeRozan scored 13 of the Raptors\u2019 fourth-quarter points, while Lowry had seven, including a three-point dagger with 53 seconds left that he followed up with another long jumper that had the Air Canada Centre crowd roaring.Derozan\u2019s final two free throws with nine seconds left were just icing by that point.The raucous ACC crowd included Pearl Jam\u2019s Eddie Vedder and Jeff Ament, NFL superstar Terrell Owens and Montreal Canadiens\u2019 P.K. Subban \u2013 who has become a regular fixture at Raptors games in the post-season.The backdrop of black and white T-shirts spelled \u201cYYZ\u201d \u2013 both a city nickname and its airport code.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tWade, who sparked outrage on social media when he took shots during \u201cO Canada\u201d in Game 3, was loudly booed every time he handled the ball.The Cleveland Cavaliers await the series winner after sweeping the Atlanta Hawks.The Raptors raced out to a 16-points before the game was 10 minutes old. DeRozan and Lowry combined for 19 first-quarter points and the Raptors led 28-18 heading into the second.Lowry\u2019s reverse layup put Toronto up by 20 points just three-and-a-half minutes before halftime, but with Lowry on the bench for a breather, the Heat ended the quarter on a 10-0 run, cutting the Raptors\u2019 lead to 55-45 at halftime.', u'Eugenie Bouchard advances, Milos Raonic ousted at Italian OpenROME \u2013 Eugenie Bouchard reached the third round of the Italian Open with an upset of second seed Angelique Kerber on Wednesday, while fellow Canadian Milos Raonic was ousted by recent nemesis Nick Kyrgios.Bouchard, once ranked as high as fourth in the world before a disastrous 2015 season derailed her rise to stardom, defeated Kerber 6-1, 5-7, 7-5. Kerber committed four of her five double faults in the first set, and Bouchard took advantage of the German\u2019s early sloppy play by taking a quick lead.Kerber rallied in the second set, converting three of five break point opportunities, but Bouchard claimed the match by coming out on top in a hard-fought third set.Bouchard, who has reached two finals so far in a resurgent 2016 season, next faces Barbora Strycova.Raonic, meanwhile, fell 7-6 (5), 6-3 to Kyrgios, who has won three straight matches against the Canadian.Kyrgios had six aces to Raonic\u2019s three, and broke 10th seed on three of 10 opportunities.Raonic, from Thornhill, Ont., did not reach the quarter-final stage at a tournament for the first time this season.', u'The beauty and challenge of Sawgrass\u2019 island greenI like to think I\u2019m the type of player who does well when the score is only single digits under par. That\u2019s probably why I\u2019ve had success in difficult tournaments, like when the U.S. Open was at Merion or at the , which is this week.I tend to think my way around a course well. I\u2019m the type of player who can hang around even if things aren\u2019t going well. And over four days you\u2019ll have one day where you aren\u2019t feeling it. And how you play on those off-days are key around a course like the TPC at Sawgrass\u2019 Stadium Course, where the Players Championship is held.Sawgrass is a great test. It asks you to hit exacting shots with every club in your bag\u2014from wedge on the 17th hole to a two iron on the 8th hole. The par fours and fives provide a great mix, and when you play a course where strategy and a strong mental game are key, I like to think I have a good chance to be successful. I tend to think of myself as a player who does well on tough courses and it is nice to see the results back that up.Of course Sawgrass is best known for its 17th hole, the island par three that everyone immediately recognizes. I think it is a fun hole\u2014but depending on the conditions it can be terrifying considering it is only 130 yards long. I\u2019ve hit for the cycle there\u2014I\u2019ve made birdies and bogeys. I\u2019ve had shots land in the water, and frankly it would be pretty hard to play there with any regularity and not have one find a watery grave. The green is a tiny target and when they tuck the pins you don\u2019t want to be too far away from them, so you have to be really careful with your yardage. Mistakes can happen\u2014all too easily sometimes.The hole\u2019s difficulty is what makes the shots Rickie Fowler hit last year in regulation and the playoff truly amazing. Those are the kind of memories you take away from the Players. You remember the great shots the best players make under pressure.When you think of a great short, iconic par threes, you think of the 7th at Pebble and the 17th at Sawgrass\u2014both short holes that prove you don\u2019t need to have a long par three to make a great hole. From my perspective, I embrace the challenge.But there are some nuances that fans likely don\u2019t recognize that are key to having success there. My caddy, Brent Everson, has a lot of experience at Sawgrass and has taught me a lot about the course. He\u2019s from the St. Augustine area and has caddied for about 25 years. He told me that when you get to the 16th green you need to start considering the wind on the 17th hole. That\u2019s the trickiest part \u2014 figuring out 17. There are so many grandstands around that you can\u2019t get a good gauge of the wind and you want to have a handle on that before you get on the tee box. You\u2019re trying to determine which way the wind is going so you really trust the shot you\u2019re about to hit and commit to it.When it comes to what shot you select, the wind is key to that. I\u2019ve hit wedges into the hole, but they get affected by the wind the most given how much spin is on the ball. But I\u2019ve hit 7-iron one year when it was cold and the wind was blowing in. That\u2019s a little bit more frightening because you don\u2019t have much room for error. It is a sinking feeling when it goes right over the pin and it bounces and disappears.With one swing you can make a birdie and put yourself in the mix, or you can make a double bogey and shoot yourself out of it. That\u2019s the beauty of the tournament\u2014so much can happen right at the end.', u'9-11 amputee wins 7 medals at Invictus GamesORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 Sarah Rudder was on the verge of a key promotion in the U.S. Marines on Sept. 11, 2001 when the terrorist attacks struck and eventually left her without a leg.But she has come back from that setback to thrive on another stage, winning seven medals through Tuesday in two days of Paralympic events ranging from rowing to shot-put at the international Invictus Games founded by Britain\u2019s Prince Harry for wounded members of armed services.\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Rudder said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cIt shows that just because I\u2019m an amputee doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t go out and put my heart and soul on the track or any event that I do.\u201dRudder, awaiting her promotion ceremony, was unscathed in the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon and able to help others to safety, but two days later she was not so lucky. When she returned to the defence complex to help remove remains of victims, her left ankle got stuck in a concrete barrier and was crushed. The injury, which required five reconstructive surgeries, eventually led to her left leg being amputated two years ago.After struggling to deal with the loss of a limb, Rudder found a way to turn despair into triumph through sports. She became a part of the military\u2019s Wounded Warrior program, which paved the way for Rudder to compete in the Invictus Games, held this year at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando following an opening ceremony Sunday evening.By Tuesday, Rudder already had won seven medals for Team USA, taking home the first gold medal of the games on Monday when she finished first in the lightweight powerlifting competition. She also won gold in the one-minute indoor rowing competition.On Tuesday, Rudder won gold in the discus and 100 metres and also took home silver medals in four-minute indoor rowing, shot-put and 200 metres dash for a two-day total of seven medals.Excelling at the Invictus Games, which includes nearly 400 wounded and sick servicemen and women from 14 countries around the world, allows Rudder to prove that her injury won\u2019t limit what she can accomplish.That was the precisely Prince Harry\u2019s goal when he started the Invictus Games a year ago.\u201cI served along with soldiers from all over the world,\u201d Prince Harry said at the opening ceremony. \u201cI saw the sacrifices they and their families made to serve their nations. I learned about the importance of team work and camaraderie in the way that only military service can teach you.\u201dRudder, who won nine medals in last year\u2019s Warrior Games, said it was amazing to see competitors with so many different kinds of injuries.\u201cI might be missing a leg but there are people out there missing two and three limbs or are paralyzed from the waist down or chest down. They are my inspiration.\u201cMe just having one leg missing, I\u2019m able to look at them and say, \u2018If they can do it, I can do it.\u201d\u2018', u'Raptors look to correct shooting woes in Game 5 versus HeatTORONTO \u2013 In the wake of a painful overtime loss in Miami, Raptors coach Dwane Casey says he\u2019s sleeping like a baby \u2013 \u201cwaking up and crying.\u201dThe quip drew the laughter he intended. In reality, Casey says it\u2019s all about maintaining an even keel going into Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinal Wednesday against the Heat.The best-of-seven series is knotted at two games apiece after the Heat\u2019s 94-87 overtime victory Monday in Miami.\u201cEverybody\u2019s upset that we lost, which they should be. But nobody\u2019s pushed the panic button,\u201d Casey told reporters Tuesday at the team\u2019s training centre after flying back from Florida. \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a competitive series.\u201dCasey calls it a \u201cnip-and-tuck\u201d series, three of the four games have gone to OT with Miami leading Toronto in total points 379-374.Watching from the comfort of their homes are the Cleveland Cavaliers, who swept the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday. They will be well rested come the Eastern final.Toronto\u2019s all-star backcourt continues to struggle. Kyle Lowry, who fouled out with 1:58 remaining, and DeMar DeRozan, nursing an injured thumb, shot a combined 6 for 28 on Monday night.Lowry, who had a breakout night in Game 3, is averaging 15.0 points a game in the playoffs on 33.1 per cent shooting. DeRozan is averaging 17.7 points on 33.0 per cent shooting. The regular season numbers for Lowry were 21.2 points and 42.7 per cent shooting and for DeRozan 23.5 points and 44.6 per cent shooting.\u201cThe guys, they\u2019re not shooting well \u2026 We know about it, Miami knows about it,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do things to get around it and trying to create more offence with those guys struggling the way they are.\u201cBut again they\u2019re going to be our guys. Because at some point they\u2019re going to get their rhythm, their shot \u2013 somebody else is going to step up and they may be more of a decoy \u2013 but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re just going to bench Kyle and DeMar and go away from them. They\u2019re our guys. We believe in them. They\u2019re our two all-stars and sooner or later they\u2019re going to come through or be a part of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201dDeRozan did sit out all but 1:38 of the final quarter Monday, however.Casey, who has said his team will \u201cride or die\u201d with the two all-stars, noted DeRozan\u2019s shooting was off before he jammed his thumb in Game 1 of the series. \u201cA double whammy,\u201d he said.Even more so given that other teams are whacking the thumb every chance they get.Both teams will be without their starting centres Wednesday for the second game in a row. Coach Erik Spoelstra said Hassan Whiteside is staying in Miami for rest and therapy on his injured knee. The seven-footer is listed day-to-day with a sprained medial collateral ligament.Toronto big man Jonas Valanciunas (ankle) has been ruled out of the series.Only the coaches were made available to the media Tuesday.Casey looked to the positives, singling out Patrick Patterson, Cory Joseph and Lucas Nogueira for stepping up.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be different storylines each night, different ways trying to win, different ways trying to find offence,\u201d he said.Casey said the Raptors\u2019 biggest problem in Game 4 was the inability to prevent the Heat from scoring in the paint (54 points). Dwyane Wade penetrated time and time again en route to his 30 points.\u201cI don\u2019t care if you have Wilt Chamberlain or Bill Russell back there, one dribble to the rim, there\u2019s not many big guys going to get there,\u201d Casey said.Game 6 is Friday night in Miami with Game 7, if needed, set for Sunday at 3:30 p.m. ET in Toronto.', u'Tulowitzki, Happ lead Blue Jays past the Giants, 4-0SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Troy Tulowitzki homered and drove in three runs, J.A. Happ allowed five hits in 8 2/3 innings and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the San Francisco Giants 4-0 on Tuesday night for their sixth victory in eight games.Happ (5-0) was one out away from his first complete game since August 2010.

At the time it was alleged the elder Vey was having an affair with a woman by the name of Angela Nicholson.It\u2019s\xa0alleged that the pair plotted to kill Curtis Vey\u2019s wife in a house fire while Nicholson\u2019s husband would die of an overdose on Halloween.When the charges of conspiracy to commit murder were laid in 2013, investigators said Vey\u2019s wife Bridget recorded a conversation of the two discussing their plans.Jim Taylor, Nicholson\u2019s husband, said at the time that he was shocked when he heard from RCMP. He said police told him there was a will made by which his wife would inherit the family farm.He said he hadn\u2019t done up a will and planned on leaving his land to the couple\u2019s two grown daughters.None of the allegations have been tested in court.The two charged appeared in court in Melfort, Saskatchewan.Linden Vey told  that he didn\u2019t blame his family\u2019s situation for his recent disappointing play. The 24-year-old had\xa015 points in 41 games for the Canucks during their 2015-16 campaign and spent part of the season\xa0with Vancouver\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate, the Utica Comets.In a statement, Canucks general manager Jim Benning said:', u'Shaq thanks Fort McMurray wildfire \u2018true heroes\u2019, sings \u2018O Canada\u2019Basketball legend\xa0Shaquille O\u2019 Neal has  a Facebook video\xa0thanking Fort McMurray first responders.\u201cThank you to the incredible first responders in Fort McMurray.

There might still be so much more for the 6-foot-3, baby-faced point guard whose ability to make it on the big NBA stage was initially questioned by some.On Tuesday, Curry accomplished something those former greats never did: He became the first unanimous NBA MVP, earning the award for the second straight season after leading the defending champion Warriors to a record-setting season.\u201cI never really set out to change the game. I never thought that would happen in my career,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWhat I wanted to do was just be myself. \u2026 I know it inspires a lot of the next generation, a lot of people who love the game of basketball to value the skill of it, value the fact that you can work every single day to get better. You\u2019ve got to be able to put the time and the work. That\u2019s how I got here, that\u2019s how I continue to get better every single day.Curry is the 11th player in league history to be voted MVP in consecutive seasons and the first guard since Steve Nash in 2004-05 and 2005-06. Curry received 1,310 points from the 130 media voters from the U.S. and Canada.Curry was followed in the vote by Kawhi Leonard of San Antonio, LeBron James of Cleveland and Oklahoma City teammates Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant. Curry\u2019s teammate Draymond Green was seventh.Nash, Golden State\u2019s player development consultant, was on hand to congratulate Curry.\u201cIt\u2019s been weird, I haven\u2019t had to say a word to him. It\u2019s been the easiest job,\u201d Nash said.Curry is the first two-time MVP in franchise history, and Wilt Chamberlain (1959-60) is the only other Warriors winner. After guiding Golden State to its first championship in 40 years, Curry & Co. took that success even further to finish with 73 regular-season wins to top the mark set by the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls team that went 72-10.In a stunning overtime performance Monday night, Curry showed exactly how he can take over a game in a matter of seconds. He returned from a sprained right knee to score 40 points \u2014 and 17 in overtime \u2014 in a 132-125 win at Portland to put his team up 3-1 in the Western Conference semifinals.Curry was sore and fatigued but ready to go again.Curry, now one of the most recognizable and popular athletes worldwide, was presented with his MVP trophy at Oracle Arena before trying to close out the series against the Trail Blazers at home Wednesday night. His teammates were on stage to cheer the latest accomplishment in a long list of them.\u201cHe\u2019s become one of the most popular athletes on the planet,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cPeople relate to him. They genuinely enjoy watching him play and admire his humility and just the way he carries himself. The impact he\u2019s had on the game is really dramatic.\u201dCurry averaged an NBA-best 30.1 points per game to go with 6.7 assists and 5.4 rebounds. He also led the NBA with 2.1 steals a game while shooting 50.4 per cent from the field, 45.4 per cent from 3-point range and 90.8 per cent from the foul line.From the start of the season, Curry vowed to take his game to another level \u2014 and did he ever. Now, all that matters to him is staying healthy and leading the Warriors to another title.Curry understands, and even embraces, the constant scrutiny that comes with being an MVP and playing on a championship team.His pregame ballhandling routine alone draws huge crowds in every city, but it has been his long-range touch that has forced defences to extend \u2014 and has kids and adults alike throwing the ball up from anywhere. He made a record 402 3-pointers after no player had previously even hit 300 in a season.\u201cI want to be remembered as somebody that worked hard, that got the most out of my potential and talent and pushed the envelope,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI never really expected to change the game or spark a new way to play the game, because that\u2019s the way I know how to play, and that\u2019s what was in me when I started the game back when I was 5.\u201d', u'Saskatchewan Roughriders take Josiah St. John 1st overall in CFL draftTORONTO \u2013 The  selected offensive lineman Josiah St. John first overall in the  draft Tuesday night. The six-foot-six, 300-pound St. John spent the last two seasons with the Oklahoma Sooners, starting four of the 15 games he suited up for.He made all four starts at tackle last season after dressing for eight of the Sooners\u2019 15 contests in 2014.The communications major was the top available prospect for the draft, ranked fifth overall by the CFL scouting bureau.The top four prospects \u2014 Manitoba defensive lineman David Onyemata, Iowa receiver Tevaun Smith, Boston College defensive lineman Mehdi Abdesmad and Michigan State cornerback Arjen Colquhoun \u2014 were either drafted into the NFL or had signed contracts south of the border.St. John, a native of Ajax, Ont., will also be heading south as he will participate in the Oakland Raiders\u2019 mini-camp this weekend.Saskatchewan posted a CFL-worst 3-15 record last season but is now being led by head coach/GM Chris Jones, who guided the Edmonton Eskimos to last year\u2019s Grey Cup crown as their head coach.Jones had said prior to the draft he\u2019d entertain trade offers for the No. 1 pick but kicked off the proceedings by calling St. John\u2019s name.The Montreal Alouettes, who\u2019ve started five Canadians on their offensive line, took Laval guard Philippe Gagnon second overall. The six-foot-three, 317-pound native of Ancienn-Larette, Que., was a two-time CIS second-team all-star and had the most reps in the bench press (40) at the CFL combine in March.The Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who moved into No. 3 in a trade with B.C., continued the run of offensive linemen, selecting Brandon Revenberg of Grand Valley State. The native of Windsor, Ont., started 39 of 46 games in college but wasn\u2019t named on the CFL scouting bureau\u2019s final top-20 draft prospects list.The Toronto Argonauts, at No. 4, took Acadia receiver Brian Jones.

He stayed in the game.Encarnacion\u2019s sixth home run of the season moved him into a tie with Joe Carter for fourth place on the club\u2019s all-time list with 203.Gavin Floyd pitched a perfect eighth and Roberto Osuna allowed Crawford\u2019s leadoff double before finishing for his seventh save. Toronto improved to 3-6 in San Francisco in the club\u2019s first visit to the Giants\u2019 waterfront ballpark since a pair of games in June 2013. The Blue Jays won for the seventh time in the last nine meetings with the Giants after a seven-game skid.Peavy walked two of his five batters in the first inning while giving up a pair of singles, putting himself in an immediate jam. He allowed Saunders\u2019 RBI single but got out of the inning without further damage.Peavy gave up three runs on five hits and struck out six in five innings.The right-hander lost a start at AT&T Park for the first time since July 8, 2015. He had been 7-0 with a 3.41 ERA in 11 home starts since before Monday.Andy Burns struck out as a pinch-hitter in Sanchez\u2019s spot in the eighth while making his major league debut.Blue Jays: LHP Brett Cecil was placed on the paternity list and RHP Ryan Tepera recalled from Triple-A Buffalo.Giants: LF Angel Pagan will not be placed on the disabled list for now as he nurses a strained left hamstring that kept him out for the eighth straight game, though he was available as a pinch-hitter. \u2026 RHP reliever Sergio Romo (pitching elbow) threw an easy bullpen session but \u201che\u2019s a ways away still,\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said. \u2026 San Francisco recalled OF Jarrett Parker from Triple-A Sacramento and OF Mac Williamson was optioned to Sacramento. \u2026 RHP George Kontos (elbow) will continue his minor league rehab assignment Tuesday after making his first rehab appearance Sunday at Triple-A.Blue Jays: LHP J.A. Happ (4-0) looks to win his fifth straight decision to start the year but has never beaten the Giants, going 0-4 in four starts. He was on the losing end of Matt Cain\u2019s perfect game at AT&T Park on June 13, 2012, while with Houston.Giants: Cain opposes Happ again Tuesday night this time searching for his first win of 2016 after beginning 0-4.', u'Heat\u2019s Dwyane Wade continues to torch Raptors, Miami beats Toronto in OTMIAMI \u2013 With no Jonas Valanciunas and virtually no DeMar DeRozan, the last thing the Toronto Raptors needed was to lose Kyle Lowry.But Lowry had to watch from the bench after fouling out as the Raptors dropped a 94-87 decision to the Miami Heat in overtime on Monday, that evened the Eastern Conference semifinals at two wins apiece.And moments after the loss, the Raptors point guard took the blame squarely on himself.\u201cI can\u2019t be in foul trouble, I think I let my team down tonight,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI take the loss for us, because me not being out there on the floor hurt our team.\u201dDwyane Wade poured in 30 points, including an emphatic dunk to end overtime, to lead the Heat.Terrence Ross and Cory Joseph had 14 points apiece for Toronto, which is without starting centre Valanciunas for the remainder of this series. Bismack Biyombo had 13 points and 13 rebounds, while DeMarre Carroll chipped in with 13 points.As big a blow as the loss of Valanciunas is, DeRozan\u2019s thumb injury led to one of his worst games as a Raptor. He shot just 4-for-17 for nine points, and he and Lowry, who had 10 points before fouling out with 1:58 to play, shot a combined 6-for-28 on the night.\u201cIt\u2019s the feeling of being uncomfortable, and not doing the things that you normally do with gripping the ball and everything,\u201d said DeRozan, who jammed his right thumb late in Game 1. \u201cI think the missed layup (in the first quarter) showed me how much I have to deal with it, but it\u2019s nothing I\u2019ll ever make an excuse about.\u201dFor the third time in this roller-coaster series, that has felt more like a heavyweight fight at times, the game needed overtime to decide a winner.And it was an ugly one. With a mish-mash of lineups, the Raptors looked headed for a blowout loss with their 29 per cent scoring in the first half. But they opened the third quarter with a 17-4 run and took a 62-60 lead into the fourth quarter. Ross drilled two threes to put Toronto up by nine points with six-and-a-half minutes on the clock.Wade promptly led a comeback that would pull the Heat within two points with just over a minute to play. Then with 12.6 seconds on the clock, the Heat star drove to the hoop, and his basket sent the game into extra time.\u201cYou have two competitive teams that are going and close to equal talent-wise,\u201d said Raptors coach Dwane Casey. \u201cThese are two tough-minded teams.\u201dWith Lowry on the bench, the Raptors could do nothing right in OT. Joseph and DeRozan scored the team\u2019s only baskets, and Wade swiped a Raptors turnover in the final seconds for a dunk that sealed the Heat\u2019s victory.\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any doubt that this game was going to go into overtime,\u201d said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. \u201cIt\u2019s just one heck of a series. Both teams, players are going after it. This series is complex, it\u2019s changing fast.\u201dThe Raptors shot just 40 per cent on the night, while the Heat weren\u2019t much better at 44 per cent. Each team grabbed 27 rebounds.Now the series heads back to Toronto for Game 5 on Wednesday, and returns to Miami for Game 6.Asked if stealing one of the two games in Miami was any consolation, Lowry answered with a definitive \u201cno.\u201d\u201cPersonally I\u2019m pissed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we wanted to come down here and get two, and we had the opportunity. But we\u2019re going to look at the positives, we\u2019re 2-2, best of three and we\u2019ve got two at home.\u201dWith Valanciunas out for the series with a sprained ankle from Game 3, the Raptors have to hope DeRozan and Lowry can rediscover their shooting touch.\u201cWhen our two top players don\u2019t shoot the ball as well, and we had some turnovers down the stretch, I felt like we let the game slip away,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThat is on all of us.\u201dBiyombo had a decent night in place of Valanciunas, and made his presence felt early in the game when he soared over Amar\u2019e Stoudemire for a monstrous dunk, then flexed his massive biceps in celebration.The Heat are also without starting centre Hassan Whiteside, who sprained his medial collateral ligament in his knee on Saturday.Wade, meanwhile, apologized for his behaviour during \u201cO Canada\u201d in Game 3. Wade sparked a social media firestorm for shooting baskets during the anthem, but corrected himself by being the first to line up for the anthems on Monday.\u201cI apologize for Canada thinking I would disrespect their country,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI have so much respect for the Toronto Raptors, I have so much respect for the country of Canada.\u201dSmall pockets of Raptors fans, including Montreal Canadiens star P.K. Subban, who sat courtside, dotted an American Airlines Arena that was otherwise a sea of Miami white. Several fans were shown on the Jumbotron in \u201cWe The South\u201d T-shirts.Biyombo had seven points in a first quarter that saw the Raptors shoot just 37 per cent, and Miami took a 25-21 lead into the second.A Carroll three-pointer tied the game at 35-35, but the Heat hit back with a 9-0 run to take a 44-35 lead into halftime.', u'Rio Olympics should be postponed due to Zika, says Canadian public health profTORONTO \u2013 A Canadian professor of law and public health says the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro should be postponed or moved to other venues because of the threat posed by the Zika virus epidemic in Brazil.Amir Attaran of the University of Ottawa says the expected half-million visitors to the Olympic and Paralympic Games pose a risk of spreading the virus once they return to their home countries.Attaran argues in a commentary published in the Harvard Public Health Review that the International Olympic Committee and the World Health Organization are being irresponsible in allowing the Games to go ahead.Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that has been found to cause underdeveloped brains in babies born to women infected while pregnant. It\u2019s also potentially linked to neurological disorders in some infected children and adults.Attaran says it\u2019s more important to delay the Games or move them to safer locations than to have unborn babies facing a lifetime of permanent disability.He says events could be split up using facilities in cities such as London and Beijing, which hosted previous Summer Games.', 'Brazil soccer riot leaves 2 in serious conditionTwo soccer fans in Brazil were left in a serious condition after a massive brawl between rival supporters at the Alagoas State Championship final on Sunday. The violence broke out between supporters of Clube de Regatas Brasil (CRB) and bitter rivals Centro Sportivo Alagoano (CSA), after CRB beat CSA to take the championship at the Estadio Rei Pele in Maceio, some 1,700 kilometres to the north of Rio de Janeiro.Dozens of angry fans from both teams invaded the pitch to attack one another, as well as players and officials.One man was unconscious on the ground as he was kicked by more than 10 fans.Local website Globoesporte.com quotes the media relations office from Hospital Geral do Estado (HGE) saying that five people were admitted to the hospital, two in a serious condition.Brazil is notorious for football violence with incidents taking place inside stadia and deaths occurring outside grounds every year.', 'Raptors seek series stranglehold against Miami in Game 4The Toronto Raptors will be without centre  as the team tries to take a stranglehold in their second-round playoff series tonight in Miami.The Raptors face the Heat in Game 4 with a 2-1 series lead. Toronto will have to do without Valanciunas, who will miss the rest of the series with a sprained right ankle.The big man suffered the injury in the third quarter of . Valanciunas has averaged 15 points and 12.1 rebounds in these playoffs.The Heat may also have to play the rest of the series without centre Hassan Whiteside, who is listed as day-to-day with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee.Valanciunas missed 22 games in the regular season with a broken hand but the team still managed to win 16 games during that span.', u'Blue Jays bullpen waste impressive start by Estrada in 4-2 loss to DodgersTORONTO \u2013 The Los Angeles Dodgers took advantage of a shaky bullpen performance by the Blue Jays on Sunday afternoon in a 4-2 comeback win over Toronto at Rogers Centre.Blue Jays starter Marco Estrada was brilliant over seven innings but relievers Drew Storen and closer Roberto Osuna couldn\u2019t hold the one-run lead in the eighth. Storen (0-2) put two runners in scoring position and the Dodgers brought them both home against Osuna.Chase Utley led off with a walk and moved to third base on a ground-rule double by Corey Seager. Osuna then struck out Justin Turner and intentionally walked Adrian Gonzalez to load the bases.Yasmani Grandal hit a sacrifice fly to bring home the tying run and Howie Kendrick put the Dodgers ahead with an RBI single. Los Angeles (16-15) tacked on an insurance run in the ninth.Reliever Chris Hatcher (3-3) worked one inning for the win and Kenley Jansen earned his 11th save. Los Angeles outhit Toronto 8-5.Estrada \u2013 who allowed just three hits \u2013 was matched by Dodgers starter Ross Stripling, who gave up one hit and one earned run over six innings. The Dodgers took two of three in the weekend interleague series to leave Toronto (16-17) with a 4-3 mark on their homestand.After a pair of clean innings, Kevin Pillar put Toronto on the board in the third. He led off with a double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on a Ryan Goins grounder to the right side.The Dodgers put their first runner on in the fourth inning when Utley drew a walk. After a Seager strikeout, Turner reached on a Troy Tulowitzki error.Estrada responded by catching Gonzalez looking before fanning Grandal. The Toronto right-hander finished with two walks and eight strikeouts.Pillar, who entered play with a .385 average over his last 14 games, nearly had another hit in the fifth inning but Joc Pederson robbed him with a nice diving catch in shallow centre field.The sellout crowd of 46,665 gave Estrada a nice cheer after Trayce Thompson led off the sixth with a double for the first Los Angeles hit of the afternoon. Thompson moved to third on a Utley sacrifice fly but was left stranded when Gonzalez grounded out.Pederson put the Dodgers on the board with a solo homer in the seventh inning. He belted a hanging curveball over the wall for his sixth homer of the season.Toronto regained the lead in the bottom half of the frame. Justin Smoak hit a two-out single off Hatcher and Tulowitzki walked before Pillar smacked a single to right field.Smoak was originally held at third base but came home with the go-ahead run when Thompson bobbled the ball.Toronto relievers Jesse Chavez, Chad Girodo and Gavin Floyd all worked in the ninth. Smoak hit a one-out ground-rule double off Jansen but the right-hander got Tulowitzki on a lineout and Pillar on a strikeout to end it.', u'Raptors\u2019 centre Valanciunas out for rest of Heat series with sprained ankleToronto Raptors\u2019 centre Jonas Valanciunas will miss the rest of the series against the Miami Heat after spraining his right ankle in Game 3, the team said Sunday.Valanciunas was injured in the third quarter of Saturday\u2019s game, which the Raptors took 95-91 thanks to a resurgent Kyle Lowry.The team said that in the Heat series Valanciunas has averaged 18.3 points, 12.7 rebounds, 1.33 blocks and 33.7 minutes.He has averaged 15 points, with 12.1 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 28.5 minutes in 10 playoff games this season.They said his status will be updated as appropriate.Meanwhile, the Heat announced Sunday that centre Hassan Whiteside was also injured in Game 3 and is listed as day-to-day with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee.The severity of Whiteside\u2019s injury is not known.The Raptors lead the series 2-1, with the next game Monday in Miami.\t\t\t\n\t\t', u'Heat guard Dwyane Wade warms up during \u2018O Canada\u2019, Canadians unimpressedDwyane Wade is Public Enemy No. 1 for a few Canadians at the moment.The Miami Heat guard chose to continue to warm up during \u201cO Canada\u201d played in Miami prior to Game 3 of the Heat-Raptors series.To add insult to injury, Wade went off for 38 points although it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent .Wade\u2019s decision is a clear violation NBA H (2) which reads:The Heat guard\u2019s extra warmup has irked many north of the border.Toronto Mayor John Tory weighed in with some friendly advice for the Heat superstar.Social media savvy Toronto city councillor\xa0Norm Kelly also tweeted out\xa0his displeasure with Wade\u2019s perceived\xa0slight.Ontario legislature member Mike Colle, who represents a Toronto riding, chimed in too, releasing a statement calling on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to \u201cformally seek a public apology\u201d from Wade.There is no word from the league on whether he will be disciplined although in the past, players have been suspended for this.Back in 1995-96, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf chose not stand for the national anthem as a political protest.While he was eventually suspended for one game, this carried on until March before it happened. It would be a surprise if the NBA did much of anything in this case given it is the playoffs and it was a one-time occurence.\xa0', u'Toronto Raptors beat Miami Heat 95-91 to take Game 3, go up 2-1 in seriesMIAMI \u2013 It took all of 24 minutes for Kyle Lowry to put the demons of a horrible playoff slump behind him.With big man Jonas Valanciunas on the bench with a sprained ankle, and a double-digit lead quickly disappearing, the all-star version of Lowry finally emerged after halftime Saturday.The Raptors point guard scored 29 of his 33 points in the second half to carry the Raptors to a 95-91 victory over the Miami Heat, and a 2-1 lead in their best-of-seven second-round playoff series.And moments after the couple of hundred Raptors fans at American Airlines Arena cheered them off the court, coach Dwane Casey said it \u201cfeels good\u201d to be able to put the ball in Lowry\u2019s hands down the stretch.\u201cBecause now you\u2019re not searching,\u201d Casey said. \u201cEveryone in the world knew Kyle was struggling and it made it a lot easier for us to score when he\u2019s scoring the way he did tonight.\u201dDeMar DeRozan added 19 points, while Valanciunas had 16 points and 12 rebounds before he left early in the third quarter.Lowry shot 11-for-19 and scored 14 of Toronto\u2019s final 20 points in a game that could have gone very wrong after Valanciunas limped to the locker-room in the third quarter.\u201cJV was holding it down, he\u2019s been holding it down all playoffs, and I think for me and DeMar, we just said we\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cWe knew the situation we were in.\u201dThat situation was a battle of guards. The Heat had already lost their starting centre Hassan Whiteside to a sprained knee in the first half, and Dwyane Wade responded by scoring 29 of his 38 points in the second half for Miami.The Raptors were the dominant team in the first half, but Wade lit it up with 18 points in the third quarter that brought American Airlines Arena to life, and sent the game into the fourth all even at 68-68.The Heat raced out to an early six-point lead, but the Raptors clawed their way back and when Lowry drilled a three-pointer and followed it up with a layup, it gave the visitors a four-point lead with just under four minutes to play.The game was tied at 82-82 when Lowry drilled a three, then a pair of free throws to put Toronto up by five points with a minute and a half to play, prompting a chant of \u201cLet\u2019s go Raptors!\u201d from the fans who made the trip south.Wade and Lowry traded baskets before DeRozan\u2019s five free throws, plus a missed three by Joe Johnson, sealed the victory for Toronto.DeRozan and Lowry sat at the post-game podium together, as they have done throughout the post-season. DeRozan joked when asked how Lowry\u2019s resurgence changes the series.\u201cUm, it makes it a lot easier,\u201d DeRozan said.\u201cDamn, putting pressure on me,\u201d Lowry replied.DeRozan then turned serious, saying \u201cA lot of people are acting like I\u2019ve never seen it before. Like it\u2019s my first time seeing it.That\u2019s the Kyle I know, and I support him the same way even if he\u2019s having a rough time.\u201dLowry\u2019s woeful post-season shooting plunged to new depths in Monday\u2019s Game 1, when he scored just seven points and stayed on the court throwing up shots until 1:15 a.m.\u201cI had some good people, the people who can get to me, they got to me,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a guy to my left (nudging DeRozan), he\u2019s probably my biggest supporter, and backbone to me right now. And he said \u2018Just keep going.\u201d\u2018Game 4 is Monday in Miami, and the big question marks will be the health of Valanciunas and Whiteside.\u201cIt\u2019s swollen, we\u2019re gonna see (Sunday) how it is and we\u2019ll play it by ear,\u201d said Valanciunas, wearing shower shoes in the locker-room.Whiteside left with his knee encased in a soft cast.American Airlines Arena was blanketed Saturday in white Heat T-shirts, dotted with pockets of Toronto fans, who cheered every Raptors basket.\u201cNothing surprises me about Raptors fans,\u201d said DeMarre Carroll. \u201cNot them packing Jurassic Park, some of the Instagram and tweets I get, nothing surprises me about those fans. I feel like they\u2019re some of the best fans in the world and I feel like we have to just keep going and keep giving them something to cheer about.\u201dThe series heads back to Toronto for Game 5 on Wednesday.Valanciunas was superb from the opening tipoff, making his first three shots and scoring eight points in the first to put the Raptors up 23-19 going into the second.Johnson scored back-to-back baskets to give Miami a brief one-point lead midway through the second quarter, but a Valanciunas alley-oop capped an 18-6 Raptors run for an 11-point Toronto lead.The Raptors went into halftime up 49-40.Lowry poured in 15 points in the third to lift the Raptors to a 10-point lead, but they couldn\u2019t contain Wade, whose jump shot with 23 seconds left tied the game.', u'Canadian-owned Nyquist wins Kentucky Derby to remain undefeatedLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2013 Canadian-owned Nyquist captured\xa0the Kentucky Derby by 1 1/4 lengths on Saturday, improving to 8-0 in his career as the fourth consecutive favourite to win the race.Ridden by Mario Gutierrez, Nyquist ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:01.31.

Dickey\u2019s longest outing of the season was wasted as the Toronto Blue Jays fell to Clayton Kershaw and the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-2 on Saturday afternoon at Rogers Centre.Kershaw allowed two earned runs over seven innings as the Dodgers (15-15) snapped the Blue Jays\u2019 four-game win streak.The 28-year-old Kershaw matched his season-high with 10 strikeouts and allowed eight hits while improving to 4-1 on the season.Darwin Barney had an RBI single and Kevin Pillar added and RBI double for Toronto\u2019s offence.The Blue Jays (16-16) have now lost six straight starts by Dickey (1-4) this season.L.A.\u2019s offence got to the knuckleballer in the third inning.After Justin Turner reached to load the bases on a fielder\u2019s choice, Chase Utley scored on a passed ball from Blue Jays catcher Josh Thole, giving the Dodgers a 2-1 lead. Adrian Gonzalez then singled to score a pair of runs.Joc Pederson opened the scoring in the second inning taking Dickey\u2019s 2-1 pitch deep over the centre field wall for his fifth home run of the season.Dickey allowed four runs, two earned on six hits while striking out three.Barney\u2019s second inning single scored Justin Smoak to tie the game 1-1.Kershaw, who was making his first career start against the Blue Jays, retired the following eight Toronto hitters in order following Barney\u2019s RBI single.The Blue Jays didn\u2019t get to the left-hander again until the fifth inning when Kevin Pillar\u2019s double to left scored Barney from first.Pillar, who hit a game-winning three-run home run in Friday\u2019s 5-2 win, has now reached base in 12 straight home games.With Chad Girodo on to pitch in the eighth, Turner added to the Dodgers lead going deep of the Blue Jays reliever for his first home run of the season.Pillar showed off his defensive prowess in the ninth, making a diving catch in centre field to rob Carl Crawford of extra bases.Howie Kendrick scored from third on the play.Girodo and right-hander Joe Biagini each pitched an inning of relief in the loss.Notes: The Blue Jays conclude their seven-game homestand on Sunday afternoon against the Dodgers.

Bellator president Scott Coker calls Parsons \u201can exceptional athlete and a rising star in the sport.\u201d', u'Raptors take Game 2 in OT against Miami, 96-92TORONTO \u2013 DeMarre Carroll came up big for the Toronto Raptors both on and off the floor Thursday.Carroll showed some tough love for struggling all-star Kyle Lowry, and then went out and scored a team-high 21 points to lift the Raptors 96-92 over the Heat in overtime, to send the series to Miami tied at one game apiece.And moments after Lowry scored on a key jump shot with 15 seconds left in regulation, Carroll pulled the point guard aside and said \u201cI told you so.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been texting Kyle, I kind of do the rough brother texting with Kyle, I tell him you\u2019re Kyle Lowry, you need to play like you got a chip on your shoulder,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI remember the Kyle Lowry in Memphis that got traded. And that\u2019s the biggest thing for Kyle is he gotta remember who he is. He\u2019s a blue-collar, gritty, grimy type of person.\u201dTwo days after perhaps the worst game of his career, Lowry had 18 points, including two clutch baskets in the final 46 seconds of regulation, plus six assists, four rebounds and three steals.Jonas Valanciunas had 15 points and 12 rebounds, DeMar DeRozan chipped in with 20 points, and Terrence Ross added 10.In what\u2019s been a roller-coaster post-season for the Raptors, it was another wild night.The Raptors roared out to a 14-point lead, and looked poised to romp to a relatively easy victory over Miami, but the Heat had all the momentum in a horrible third quarter for Toronto and took a 65-63 lead into the fourth.Luol Deng capped an 8-0 Heat run with a three-pointer to give Miami a seven-point lead with six minutes to play. But the Raptors clawed their way back over a thrilling final few minutes of regulation.\u201cOur sense of urgency was there,\u201d said Raptors coach Dwane Casey.After Lowry\u2019s jumper with 15 seconds to play, Goran Dragic, who played the second half with eight stitches in his lip, sunk a heartbreaking three with 10.5 seconds left to send the game into overtime tied 86-86.Toronto dominated in OT, virtually the reverse of Tuesday\u2019s game. Miami missed its first five shots, and the Raptors had baskets from DeRozan and Valanciunas, who was huge down the stretch. A Deng dunk made it a four-point game, but free throws in the dying seconds from Cory Joseph, DeRozan and Lowry iced the victory for Toronto.DeRozan and Lowry laughed when asked if they think the Raptors will have a playoff game that resembles the consistent squad of the regular-season.\u201cMan, it\u2019s been ugly,\u201d DeRozan said.\u201cUh-gly,\u201d Lowry added.\u201cWhen we do, I\u2019m pretty sure you will know,\u201d said DeRozan, to which Lowry piped in: \u201cIF we do.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a grind man, honestly,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cWe know nothing was going to be pretty, as long as we can come out with a W, doesn\u2019t matter how we play. It\u2019s going to come.\u201dCarroll had a superb night, shooting 7-for-13 and grabbing four steals and five rebounds with his hustle play.Lowry, meanwhile, had been limited to just seven points in a horrible performance in Game 1, and stayed on the court until 1:15 a.m. shooting alone. He said the next day the Raptors can\u2019t win the series without him playing well.The two-time all-star had moments where he looked like his post-season slump might be a distant memory. He scored early on a mid-range jumper, then followed it up with a beautiful pass to Carroll for a three-pointer. And when he tossed up a three of his own late in the first quarter, the Air Canada Centre crowd of 20,906 went nuts.\u201cI felt great,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI got so many phone calls and texts from people who just care about me in general, fellow NBA players, and just friends of mine supporting me. And then knowing I have the support of my teammates, I just had to come out and have fun and be myself.He shot just 7-for-22 on the night, while DeRozan, his right thumb taped after his jammed it on the final play in Game 1, shot just 9-for-24, and made just two of his eight free throws.\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever missed that many free throws,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve got to deal with it. It\u2019s my first game playing with it hurt, sore like it was. . . another day of rest and icing and I should be alright the next game.\u201dGame 3 is Saturday in Miami, while Game 4 is Monday.The Raptors won five of their last six regular-season matchups with Miami, but the Heat claimed the series opener 102-96 on Tuesday, ruining a thrilling comeback by Toronto to force overtime on a half-court Lowry buzzer-beater.The Air Canada Centre was painted in black and white T-shirts that spelled out \u201c6IX,\u201d the Drake-inspired nickname for Toronto. Maple Leaf Square outside drew a packed crowd of T-shirt waving fans.The Heat raced out to an early-six point lead but the Raptors found their rhythm with a 17-3 run, and took a 29-19 advantage into the second quarter.Miami cleaned up its turnovers in the second, giving up just one, and pulled to within five points before a Carroll basket sent the Raptors into the halftime break up 48-41.The Raptors shot just 6-for-20 in the third quarter, and the Heat ended the frame on a 13-2 run to take their first lead since early in the first.', u'St. Louis Blues winger Scottie Upshall watches from afar as hometown Fort McMurray burnsSt. Louis Blues winger Scottie Upshall saw images of the wildfire spreading across his hometown of Fort McMurray, Alta., and likened them to a disaster movie.\u201cI saw the freeway that I used to drive in from the airport and both sides of the roads were 100-foot flames. I saw a couple of restaurants that I used to eat at and those were gone. You know, I\u2019m thankful for all the supporters there who are doing their thing and everyone who\u2019s still there or trying to get out or looking for places to stay, we hope everyone has a helping hand.\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to support them and do what we can from here and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all get together nationally and help them out.\u201dThe 32-year-old Upshall grew up in the Alberta city and played for the Fort McMurray Oil Barons of the Alberta Junior Hockey Leauge before moving on to the Western Hockey League\u2019s Kamloops Blazers.He said his nieces were among those evacuated, although his brother and fiancee, who also live in Fort McMurray, were in St. Louis to watch Tuesday\u2019s game \u2013 a 6-1 Blues victory that gave them a 2-1 lead over the Dallas Stars in their Western Conference semifinal series.\u201cI got a lot of texts yesterday (that said) \u2018Go out and win the game for the city,\u2019 so that was pretty special,\u201d Upshall said.The wildfire has torched entire neighbourhoods and forced more than 80,000 to flee the city. The flames roared into the southwest corner of the Fort McMurray on Tuesday afternoon. It engulfed homes in three subdivisions and destroyed vehicles, gas stations and a motel.Blues coach Ken Hitchcock is from Edmonton. He interrupted his post-game news conference after Tuesday night\u2019s 6-1 victory by issuing condolences to those affected by the fire. Rookie defenceman Colton Parayko played two seasons in the minors at Fort McMurray.Stars coach Lindy Ruff is from Warburg, Alta.After Tuesday night\u2019s game, Hitchcock said he and Upshall were both able to make contact with friends and acquaintances in the city. Hitchcock said he probably knows about 100 people in the city.The Beacon Hill suburb in the south end of Fort McMurray has seen the worst damage with about 80 per cent of homes destroyed.Senators defenceman Chris Phillips, who grew up Beacon Hill, told Ottawa\u2019s CFRA radio Wednesday morning that he\u2019s been following the wildfire closely and has been in contact with family members in the area, including his sister, brother-in-law and their three young children.\u201cIt was not an enjoyable (phone) conversation, hearing (the children) in the background and their panicked voices and crying,\u201d Phillips told CFRA. \u201cReally, just the unknown. Luckily, they were able to get out of town.\u201dPhillips said he heard from his family at about 2 a.m. after they arrived in Edmonton.', u'Raptors coach Casey hopes players will \u2018take offence\u2019 to being written offTORONTO \u2013 One game into the Toronto Raptors\u2019 playoff series against Miami, LeBron James and some news outlets are already looking ahead to a Cavaliers-Heat Eastern Conference final.Raptors coach Dwane Casey was less than pleased, but not surprised.\u201cI saw that. Like I\u2019ve said, nobody respects us, everybody has written us off, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe people in this building right now, and in that locker-room over there, are the most important people to believe that. Hopefully our guys take that heart, and take offence to it. They\u2019re the ones who can do something about it.\u201dThe Raptors lost 102-96 to the Heat in Tuesday\u2019s series opener. Game 2 is Thursday in Toronto.READ MORE: The Raptors are the favourites on paper, winners of five of their six last regular-season games against Miami.James, whose Cavs topped Atlanta 104-93 in their opener, told reporters Wednesday morning he\u2019d love to face the Heat in the next round.\u201cNaturally, of course,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s since I\u2019ve came back. It\u2019d be great to play against those guys in the post-season.\u201cThroughout my whole career, I\u2019ve always wanted to go against (Dwyane) Wade in a playoff series. We\u2019ve always talked about it even before we became teammates in \u201910. It\u2019s not been heavy on my mind, but it\u2019s crossed my mind throughout my whole career.\u201dWade, meanwhile, isn\u2019t looking past Toronto.The Raptors say they\u2019re used to being overlooked and written off.\u201cI\u2019m sure we are looked at as the underdog, but we are the No. 2 seed,\u201d Kyle Lowry said. \u201cWe still have the confidence to win four games. But everybody has their own opinion, everyone has their own thoughts. Let ESPN talk about it. That\u2019s what they do, they have their opinions. We have our opinions, you guys have y\u2019all opinions, it\u2019s opinions. They still have to beat us three more times.\u201dPatrick Patterson said the lack of love for the Raptors around the league has been a constant in his three seasons in Toronto.\u201cIt\u2019s something we face every single day and something that we\u2019re OK with because at the end of the day it\u2019s us in the locker-room versus the world,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cWe have no problem with that at all.\u201d', u'Kyle Lowry wonders where shooting touch has gone after Game 1 loss to MiamiTORONTO \u2013 Kyle Lowry was late to the dressing room after Toronto\u2019s Game 1 loss to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinal. The Raptors all-star was upstairs in a practice gym trying to find his shooting touch.\u201cI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s at,\u201d said Lowry. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling right now. It\u2019s frustrating. But I\u2019m not going to shy away from the criticism or anything. I\u2019m going to continue to be aggressive and shoot shots and take the onus.\u201cI know I\u2019m not playing well at all. We got out of one series with me not playing well, shooting the ball well. We\u2019ve got to get out of this next series. I have to play better, shoot the ball better, score the ball better.\u201dHow bad was Lowry? Up until the final tick of regulation time Tuesday, he had more fouls (five) than points (four). Lowry was playing like a poster boy for an instructional tape on when bad hoops things happen.And yet on a night when he couldn\u2019t hit a barn door, Lowry amazingly sank a Hail Mary from halfcourt with no time remaining to force overtime.His redemption shot tied the game at 90-90. Miami star Dwyane Wade crumpled to the ground, his hand to his forehead, while the Air Canada Centre crowd shot to its feet as the moonshot went in.Jose Bautista\u2019s home run against the Texas Rangers in last season\u2019s baseball playoffs became known as the Bat Flip. For a few brief minutes, Lowry had the Shot.\u201cAs soon as it left his hand, I think everybody in the building kind of had an idea that would go,\u201d said Miami coach Erik Spoelstra.But Toronto could not take advantage of its second chance, losing 102-96 in OT.Lowry finished with seven points on 3-of-13 shooting (1-of-7 on three-pointers) with four rebounds, six assists and five fouls. His post-season is going from bad to worse.He said he\u2019s been through slumps like this before. \u201cBut not at this time. So that\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating. Playoffs, all eyes are on you. So it sucks that I\u2019m playing this bad when all eyes are on me. Because I know I\u2019m way better than this.\u201dHe has to pick things up, he added, although he used a different word. On the plus side, he is performing better in the practice court.\u201cI shoot the ball well when I\u2019m by myself. But I\u2019m by myself.\u201dLowry made his first basket almost five minutes into the third quarter. The second came midway through the fourth. His first assist took almost 21 minutes to come.Lowry downplayed his last-second successful shot Tuesday. \u201cIt didn\u2019t mean anything, we lost the game,\u201d he said, still cradling a ball from his post-game gym visit.He later admitted \u201cit felt good to make it. But us losing the game kind of took a little bit of the dramatics away and the feel-goodness away from it.\u201dAt times Lowry looked like a fish out of water on the court. By his own admission, he passed up \u201ca ton of shots\u201d because of his lack of success. And he admitted \u201ca thousand different things\u201d were going on in his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201dBut teammates and opponents alike said don\u2019t count him out yet.\u201cKyle Lowry, he can get it going,\u201d said Wade. \u201cWe have to always be aware of him, he\u2019s an all-star player in this league, him and (DeMar) DeRozan all year have been the leaders of this team.\u201dToronto coach Dwane Casey compared him to a baseball hitter in a slump. \u201cWe have to believe in him and we do believe in him. He\u2019s going to come out of it.\u201dTime is running out.Statisticians, meanwhile, troll Lowry and his woeful numbers.Lowry is averaging 13 points while shooting 30.6 per cent (13 per cent on three-pointers) in these playoffs. In the regular season, those numbers were 21.2, 42.7 and 38.8.ESPN Stats say his 30.6 is the worst field goal percentage in a single post-season in the last 50 years (on a minimum 100 attempts).To his credit, Lowry made no excuses. He faced the media, saying he needed to get back to having fun in the gym.Then he went back to shoot some more.', u'Kyle Lowry\u2019s long bomb forces overtime, but Raptors still can\u2019t beat the HeatTORONTO \u2013 In what\u2019s been a roller-coaster post-season for the Toronto Raptors, Game 1 versus Miami was the wildest ride yet.The Raptors played poorly, then very nearly pulled off a victory after Kyle Lowry\u2019s long-distance buzzer-beater forced overtime.But it all fell apart over the extra five minutes, as Toronto dropped a 102-96 decision to the Heat on Tuesday, in the opener of their best-of-seven second-round playoff series.Coach Dwane Casey couldn\u2019t help but feel his team had given one away.\u201cYou always think that when you have an opportunity to win,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThere was a stretch there where we just didn\u2019t execute on either end, and in a playoff situation, every possession is important.\u201dJonas Valanciunas had 24 points and 14 rebounds, DeMar DeRozan added 22 points, Terrence Ross chipped in with 19, and DeMarre Carroll and Cory Joseph had 10 points apiece for the Raptors, who advanced to the second round for the first time in 15 years.Lowry\u2019s 39-foot bomb to force overtime was the single highlight on another dreadful night for Toronto\u2019s all-star point guard. He didn\u2019t get his first assist until 15 minutes into the game, and finished with almost as many fouls (five) as points (seven). He had just six assists.\u201cI tell him all the time, good or bad, I\u2019ve got the utmost confidence in him,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he misses 15 shots in a row, I\u2019m going to stand behind him just like if he\u2019s making 15 shots in a row.\u201cHe\u2019s going to come around, it just sucks that we all had to go through this at this point in time of the season\u201dGoran Dragic scored 26 points to top the Heat, while Dwyane Wade finished with 24, moving into the 16th spot on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list.The game between the No. 2 and 3 seeds was tightly matched from the opening tipoff.Up 68-63 to start the fourth, the Heat stretched their lead to 10 points barely two minutes into the quarter. The Raptors chipped away at the difference, and Joseph\u2019s driving layup with a minute to play cut Miami\u2019s lead to two points, before Dragic responded with a gut-wrenching three-pointer that had fans heading for the exits.But two Miami turnovers and a loose ball foul allowed Toronto to come back in the dying seconds. With Toronto down 89-83, Ross hit a three-pointer. The Heat managed just one free throw as Ross hit a free throw and then Lowry sank the tying three from long distance.\u201cI unfortunately had a very good look at it, I\u2019m looking at the ball like, no way, this is not about to happen. Because it looked like it was dead on,\u201d said Wade, who dropped to the court on one knee after the shot fell. \u201cWhen it goes in, you\u2019re just crushed for a minute.\u201dThe Raptors almost had another bite of the apple in overtime, when six Raptors points pulled Toronto to within three with 27 seconds left. But Wade pounced on a DeRozan turnover to clinch the victory for Miami.Lowry said he can take some confidence in the fact the Raptors won the Indiana series without much of a scoring contribution from him.\u201cTonight we had a chance to still win the game,\u201d he said.Game 2 is Thursday in Toronto, then the series shifts to Miami for Games 3 and 4.On paper, the Raptors are favoured, winners of five of their previous six meetings with Miami. But the Heat owned the Raptors for several seasons before that. Prior to a Miami loss in March of last season, the Heat had won a whopping 16 straight against Toronto.It took both teams seven games to make the second round, Toronto edging the Pacers 89-84 on Sunday at home, and the Heat beating Charlotte in a 33-point rout.The Raptors are used to playing from behind. They\u2019ve only won one series opener, in the second round against Philadelphia in 2001.\u201cIt\u2019s basketball, a series is a series,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at it like it\u2019s difficult, we look at it like things we can clean up and get better at. A few things that we made a mistake on and still had a couple chances to win this game. We still got another opportunity to win this next game at home, and go on the road and do what we have to do.\u201dMiami is also playing without 11-time all-star Chris Bosh, who sat on the Heat bench in a designer suit. The former Raptor missed the final 29 games of the regular season after a blood clot was found in his left calf.The game was played against a Maple Leaf background of red and white-clad fans, including 17-year NFL veteran Tony Gonzalez, who chucked footballs high up into the crowd during a timeout.Outside, Maple Leaf Square drew another jam-packed crowd, while the popular Toronto sign in front of City Hall was lit in Raptors red and white.Valanciunas, with 10 points, and DeRozan (eight) scored all of Toronto\u2019s points in a first quarter that saw the Raptors briefly hold a six-point lead. They went into the second tied 18-18.The Raptors used a 15-5 run to open a six-point lead, but the Heat fired back to pull even, and Toronto took a slim 43-41 lead into the locker-room at halftime.', u"Decision to fire Calgary Flames head coach Bob Hartley not based \u2018solely on this season\u2019: GM Brad TrelivingThe Calgary Flames announced Tuesday that head coach Bob Hartley, who  as the NHL\u2019s top coach last year, had been fired.\u201cI met with Bob this morning, and we relieved Bob of his coaching duties effective immediately,\u201d Calgary Flames general manager Brad Treliving said at a morning news conference. \u201cI want to thank Bob. Bob did some very good things here. He built a foundation in this organization.\u201d\u201cHe bled for this team,\u201d Treliving said. \u201cBob\u2019s a good coach, so I want to thank him for it \u2013 and it\u2019s a difficult day to go through this.\u201dAfter surprising many by making the playoffs in 2014-15 and then beating Vancouver in the first round, Calgary (35-40-7) took a step back during the last season, finishing 26th overall.In an interview with Calgary\u2019s Global News Morning on April 13, Hartley admitted the team had a \u201ctough start\u201d to the 2015-16 season and consistency had been a \u201cmajor problem.\u201d\u201cThis decision that I reached was not based solely on this season,\u201d Treliving said.\u201cThis is not letting players off the hook,\u201d Treliving added. \u201cQuite the contrary. This is on a lot of other people that need to take responsibility as well. Myself included, the players included.\u201d\u201cI felt for us to move forward as an organization, that it was time, it was important, and it was critical that we make this decision,\u201d Treliving admitted.The news comes just four days after the  fired head coach Bruce Boudreau, leading to speculation he could be called upon to head the team.\u201cToday\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t based upon anybody sitting in the on-deck circle,\u201d Treliving said, when asked about the timing of Hartley\u2019s dismissal. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about \u2018is there a prettier girl at the dance.'\u201dTreliving added he doesn\u2019t know Boudreau personally. He said there was no set timeline for finding a replacement and that \u201cthe process will start today.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got a profile in my mind of what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d he added. \u201cI know we\u2019ll find the right match.\u201dAssociate coach Jacques Cloutier was also informed he would not be returning to the club.Associate coach Martin G\xe9linas, goaltending coach Flames fans were quick to react to the news on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.", u'Raptors look to cool off Heat in Game 1 of second-round seriesTORONTO \u2013 The Toronto Raptors had little time to celebrate their playoff win over the Indiana Pacers. They left the Air Canada Centre with homework on the Miami Heat.Toronto coach Dwane Casey told the players they had until midnight Sunday to savour the hard-fought seven-game series win over the Pacers. Given the game ended just after 10:30 p.m., it was an abridged celebration before switching focus to Miami.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go from exhaling to 100 hundred miles an hour real quick,\u201d said Casey, who pronounced himself \u201chappy for a minute\u201d after finally beating Indiana.The message appears to have got through.\u201cAs soon as I got back to my apartment, I started looking over the scouting report and the playbooks for them,\u201d said Raptors rookie Norman Powell.\u201cI started reading the book last night,\u201d said guard Kyle Lowry.The turnaround was almost as quick for the Heat, who dispatched the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday afternoon and flew north the next day.The Raptors weren\u2019t much interested in an Indiana post-mortem Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s something that we did, it\u2019s over with. We\u2019ve got to prepare for Round 2,\u201d said Lowry.\u201cI\u2019m focused on the Heat,\u201d he added several times.The all-star guard did share his thoughts on facing Miami star Dwyane Wade after playing Pacers marquee man Paul George.\u201cPaul shot the ball well. He shoots jump-shots a lot, he takes threes, he\u2019s physical. But D-Wade is just shifty. He\u2019s Dwyane Wade, he\u2019s a Hall of Famer,\u201d Lowry said with a chuckle. \u201cPG might get there. I think he will one day \u2026 he has the talent to get there. But D-Wade is a Hall of Famer. It\u2019s a different challenge.\u201dThe 34-year-old Wade has played in 159 post-season games, more than three times that of the Toronto franchise (18-31 in the post-season).Growing up, Powell says he modelled his game on Wade. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching him all my life so I\u2019m looking forward for the challenge,\u201d he said.Powell played just four minutes 38 seconds against the Heat this season but was quickly noticed by Wade.\u201cAs soon as I checked in, he looked at me and looked at coach (Erik) Spoelstra and they ran a post-up for him,\u201d said Powell. \u201cSo I know he\u2019s going to see me as a rookie and (think) that he can take advantage. So I\u2019m just going to try and make it as difficult as possible for him.\u201dPowell is literally living the dream, watching his role expand in the playoffs thanks to some gritty defence and timely offence.\u201cBut I know there\u2019s still much more for me to accomplish, much more for me to prove. I still have a big chip on my shoulder in proving a lot of people wrong,\u201d said the second-round draft pick who was taken 46th overall. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what driving me.\u201dCasey likes what he sees in Powell.\u201cI\u2019m proud of him, the way he\u2019s played, produced. He\u2019s met the challenge. The moment hasn\u2019t been too big for him \u2026 it\u2019s a big leap from UCLA to the NBA playoffs,\u201d he said.The Heat series marks Toronto\u2019s first trip to the Eastern Conference semifinals since 2001 when it lost in seven to Philadelphia.Toronto (56-26) is the second seed in the East while Miami (48-34) is No. 3.Miami remains without 11-time all-star \u2013 and former Raptor \u2013 Chris Bosh, who missed the final 29 games of the regular season after a blood clot was found in his left calf.Bosh, who averaged 19.1 points a game this season, was not on the Miami team flight but could still be in Toronto to cheer on the team Tuesday.Without Bosh, Miami is smaller and quicker \u2013 more efficient offensively but still excellent defensively, according to Casey.Miami \u2013 and Bosh \u2013 once owned the Raptors.Prior to a 102-92 loss in Toronto on March 13, 2015, the Heat had won 16 straight against the Raptors. Toronto\u2019s last victory before that was Jan. 27, 2010, when Bosh played for the Raptors and DeMar DeRozan was a rookie.The Raptors have gone 4-1 against the Heat since ending that streak. They won three of four this season with DeRozan, Toronto\u2019s other all-star, scoring 30 or more three times. He averaged 29.3 points a game against Miami, above his season average of 23.5.Veteran guard Joe Johnson, who signed with Miami in February, led the Heat with 28 points in their most recent meeting with the Raptors. The 34-year-old former all-star has averaged 18.7 points a game in his career against Toronto, second only to his 19.5 average against Portland.And in Hassan Whiteside, the Heat have a seven-footer whose 24 blocks in the Charlotte series erased Alonzo Mourning\u2019s club record of 21 for a seven-game series.Notes: If the Raptors-Heat series goes to five games, the scheduled May 11 Pearl Jam show at Air Canada Centre will be pushed back to May 12.', u'Oilers\u2019 McDavid up for NHL\u2019s rookie of the year awardNEW YORK \u2013 Edmonton forward Connor McDavid, Philadelphia defenceman Shayne Gostisbehere and Chicago forward Artemi Panarin were named the Calder Trophy finalists on Monday.The Calder Trophy is awarded to the NHL\u2019s best rookie player.McDavid, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NHL Draft, ranked fourth among rookies with 16 goals and 32 assists despite appearing in only 45 games for the Oilers due to injury.His average of 1.07 points per game led all rookies and ranked third in the entire NHL.At 19 years, 29 days, he became the ninth-youngest player in NHL history to register a five-point performance McDavid on Feb. 11 against the Toronto Maple Leafs.Gostisbehere led rookie defencemen in goals (17), assists (29), points (46), power-play goals (8), power-play points (22) and game-winning goals (5) while playing in 64 games for the Flyers.Panarin, who signed with the Blackhawks in May 2015, led all rookies in goals (30), assists (47), points (77), power-play goals (8), power-play points (24) and game-winning goals (7) while skating in 80 games.Members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association submitted ballots for the award at the conclusion of the regular season, with the top three vote-getters designated as finalists.The winner will be announced June 22 at the 2016 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.', u'Ex-49er Dana Stubblefield charged with raping \u2018developmentally delayed\u2019 womanSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2013 Former San Francisco 49er Dana Stubblefield was charged Monday with the rape of a \u201cdevelopmentally delayed\u201d woman, prosecutors announced.The Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office said Stubblefield, 45, assaulted the woman on April 9, 2015 at his Morgan Hill home after interviewing her for a babysitting job. He is charged with five felony counts and faces a \u201csubstantial prison sentence\u201d if convicted.A day before the assault, Stubblefield contacted the then 31-year-old woman on a babysitting website and arranged an interview, prosecutors said.Bail for Stubblefield is set at $250,000. His arraignment is scheduled to take place within 24 hours.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Stubblefield had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.According to a report by the Morgan Hill Police Department, the interview lasted about 20 minutes. She later received a text from Stubblefield saying he wanted to pay her for her time that day and she went back to the house, the San Jose Mercury News reported.After raping her, Stubblefield gave her $80 and let her go. The woman immediately went to the Morgan Hill Police Department and reported the rape. DNA evidence matched that of Stubblefield, the report said.', u'Dwane Casey instructs Toronto Raptors to quickly turn focus to Miami HeatTORONTO \u2013 The Raptors wasted little time putting the Indiana Pacers behind them.Toronto coach Dwane Casey says he told his players they had until midnight Sunday to savour the series win. And then start thinking about Miami.The Raptors sent the Pacers home Sunday night. The Heat flew to Toronto on Monday, one day after dispatching the Charlotte Hornets.Toronto, seeded second in the East, won three out of four games this season against the Heat, who are without all-star Chris Bosh due to blood clot issues.Casey says the Heat are playing differently without Bosh \u2013 they\u2019re smaller and quicker, stretching the floor.It\u2019s the Raptors\u2019 first trip to the Eastern Conference semifinals since 2001 when they lost in seven games to Philadelphia.', u'5,000-1 underdog Leicester wins first Premier League titleLONDON \u2013 Leicester City completed one of the greatest-ever sporting achievements Monday when the 5,000-1 underdogs won the Premier League for the first time.Leicester players were crowded around a television inside top-scorer Jamie Vardy\u2019s house as they were handed the title by closest challenger Tottenham being held to a 2-2 draw by deposed champion Chelsea.With an insurmountable seven-point lead over Tottenham with two games remaining, Leicester is champion of England for the first time in its 132-year history.\u201cChampiones! Championes! Ole! Ole! Ole!\u201d the jubilant Leicester players sang as they jumped up and down with their arms on each other\u2019s shoulders inside Vardy\u2019s house.\u201cNobody believed we could do it, but here we are \u2013 Premier League champions and deservedly so,\u201d Leicester captain Wes Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a spirit like the one between these boys, we\u2019re like brothers.\u201dJust two years ago, Vardy and many of his teammates were playing in the second tier and then came close to instantly dropping out of the Premier League. They started this season as among the favourites to be relegated again. But on Monday night fans who never dreamed their modest club in city with a population of 330,000 would conquer wealthier rivals descended on Leicester\u2019s King Power Stadium to party into the night.\u201cPeople saw it last season when everyone expected us to be relegated, but we fought back to prove people wrong,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThis season\u2019s been a continuation of that. We\u2019ve built on the momentum, but I don\u2019t think anyone believed it would come to this.\u201dLeicester, which will collect the trophy on Saturday when it hosts Everton at home, had not even finished higher than second since 1929.English soccer has not had a first-time champion of the top flight since Nottingham Forest in 1978. And for the last 20 years the Premier League trophy has never left London or Manchester, with Arsenal, Chelsea, United and City sharing the trophy between them.Unlike that title-winning quartet or 1995 champion Blackburn, Leicester has achieved its success without lavish spending on its squad.Chelsea\u2019s draw also ensured Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri became a league title winner for the first time in his career, 12 years after the 64-year-old Italian was fired by the Blues.\u201cLet\u2019s do it for Ranieri,\u201d read one Chelsea fan\u2019s banner during Monday\u2019s game at Stamford Bridge where the trophy was presented to Chelsea last May.\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest achievement in the history of English football and it was led by an Italian,\u201d Matteo Renzi, the Italian Prime Minister, tweeted.Leicester missed a chance to seal the title on Sunday when it was held to a draw by Manchester United but Chelsea ensured the party wasn\u2019t delayed any longer.Tottenham had to win at Chelsea to keep its bid for a first title since 1961 alive and led 2-0 thanks to goals from striker Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, before Chelsea staged a second-half fight back to draw in a fiery London derby where tempers frayed and tackles flew in from everywhere.\u201cWhat a game,\u201d Leicester defender Robert Huth tweeted. \u201cMakes me look like an angel! CHAMPIONS!!!\u201dCenter half Gary Cahill pulled a goal back for Chelsea early in the second half, and with Tottenham clinging on, the equalizing goal was scored by Eden Hazard.Hazard\u2019s goal was almost a year to the day since his strike won the title for Chelsea, which is 29 points behind Leicester. Chelsea\u2019s collapse has been as astonishing as Leicester\u2019s surge to the top of the standings it was bottom of last April.Ranieri called Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink to thank him for Chelsea\u2019s part in delivering the title to Leicester, which is owned by Thai retail giant King Power.\u201c(Ranieri said) five times \u2018Thanks\u2019, because of the emotion,\u201d Hiddink said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any tears because it was not a Facetime conversation, but his voice was trembling a bit.\u201dOne bookmaker, Sky Bet, said it paid out 4.6 million pounds ($6.8 million) to punters who backed Leicester to win the title, with 128 putting money on the team at 5,000-1.No sports team has defied such odds to triumph and Leicester\u2019s improbable success has provided a feel-good story for a country divided as it prepares to vote on whether to remain in the European Union.\u201cMany congratulations to Leicester,\u201d British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted. \u201cAn extraordinary, thoroughly deserved, Premier League title.\xa0', u'Justin Trudeau drops the mic in Invictus Games challenge to the Queen, ObamaPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is showing his competitive side, jumping into a transcontinental rivalry ahead of the.In a video message posted to , Trudeau, flanked by Canada\u2019s Invictus Games athletes, sends\xa0U.S. President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and the Queen a message.\u201cOh hey, I just thought I\u2019d show our friends in the U.S. and the U.K. how Canada brings it,\u201d says Trudeau, before\xa0joining two of the athletes on the floor doing push-ups.The mics then come out and get dropped.The video comes days\xa0after , showing the pair getting a video message from \u201cMichelle.\u201d The first lady and her husband then accept the Royal\u2019s challenge to \u201cbring it\u201d to the games, with mic drops all around.Trudeau\u2019s challenge\xa0was posted shortly after the prime minister\xa0met with Prince Harry in Toronto\xa0to officially launch the countdown to the 2017 Invictus Games, which will be held in the city next year.Prince Harry launched the official countdown to the 2017 Invictus Games on Monday, promising that the Toronto edition of the Olympic-style sporting event honouring wounded, injured and sick troops would be its biggest yet.Prince Harry founded the sporting competition, which is\xa0for wounded veterans.

An electric world, life, but I\u2019m here to tell there\u2019s something else \u2013 the NHL playoffs,\u201d Phillips said at the start of his report. \u201cLet\u2019s go crazy, Smashville, let\u2019s get nuts\u201d the anchor said referring the Nashville Predator playoff game.\u201cThis is what it sounds like when doves cry and when Mike Fisher scores, his first goal of the playoffs, ties it up!\u201d the anchor said.Phillips dropped several references throughout his four-minute highlight reel.\u201cA suddenly steamy Atlanta Braves looking to take two of three from the (Los Angeles) Dodgers, Freddy Freeman tells Chase Utley, \u2018I never meant to cause you any pain, I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain, and not on first base,\u2019\u201d Phillips said.On Friday, the news anchor took to  as a result of his tribute.\u201cFirst of all, I want to thank everyone for the kind words, comments and positive feedback on this tribute I did to Prince last week. It really means a lot,\u201d Phillips wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, there were apparently some viewers, as well as management at the station, who did not feel the same way. They felt I was insensitive.\u201cAnd as a result, I was terminated today,\u201d reads the Facebook post.According to , Phillips had worked at the station for 10 years.

It just feels good to get that off,\u201d he said.\u201cThe energy, the moments, a lot of people don\u2019t get those opportunities to be able to play in a Game 7 when everything is the line, and all the things that me and this guy (fellow all-star Kyle Lowry, seated next to him) and the team has been through,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to get that moment duplicated, and we just want to live every single minute of it.\u201dRookie Norman Powell had 13 points for Toronto, while Patrick Patterson and Lowry had 11 apiece. Jonas Valanciunas had 10 points and a game-high 15 rebounds.Paul George, who was spectacular all series, led Indiana with 26 points.Backed by a raucous home crowd, the Raptors led almost the entire game, and took a 78-64 advantage into the fourth quarter.Toronto went up by 16 points when Powell drilled a three-pointer and then swiped the ball away from Indiana on the next possession for a Cory Joseph bucket. But in a roller-coaster series where no lead has been safe, the Pacers pulled to within three points with 2:36 to play when Monta Ellis drilled a three.A pair of George free throws made it a three-point game with 53 seconds to play, but DeRozan grabbed a huge steal off George on the Pacers\u2019 next possession and then calmly sunk two free throws with 6.5 seconds to play to secure the victory.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cI think everybody wrote the Raptors off and gave us up for dead,\u201d said coach Dwane Casey. \u201cBut that locker-room is full of fighters and scrappers and guys that are really getting into it now. Like I told them, it\u2019s a marathon, but I\u2019m happy for those young men in there.\u201dThe Raptors had advanced to the second round of the playoffs one other time, way back in 2001, when they knocked off the New York Knicks in a five-game series.After last year\u2019s four-game debacle at the hands of Washington, they\u2019ve played under heavy expectations. The subtext of this season was whether or not they could win a playoff series, and then roaring to a franchise-best 56 wins and earning the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference only intensified the pressure.Monkey successfully removed, the Raptors hope they\u2019ll play more freely in the next round.\u201cHonestly, before you come into a game like this you probably get hundreds of text messages of people telling you what happened in the past years,\u201d said Bismack Biyombo. \u201cThe big thing for us was if we finish second in the East, the right way to finish this series is to move on to the next round. . . This is just the beginning of something great.\u201dDeRozan, meanwhile, struggled with his shooting all series, going 31.9 per cent over the seven games. He was 10-for-32 Sunday, and when asked about the amount of shots he took, Lowry interjected.\u201cCan I answer that one? He was going to empty the clip,\u201d Lowry said with a smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s what he did tonight and that was his goal. And we\u2019re going to ride with him emptying that clip. I\u2019m answering that question for you so I don\u2019t care if he shot 40 times. He emptied the clip and we won. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201dLowry shot 31.6 per cent for the series, but doled out nine assists, and was at his scrappy best Sunday, diving all over the floor.The Maple Leaf \u2013 laid out in a pattern of red and white T-shirts \u2013 provided the Air Canada Centre backdrop. And the crowd of 20,669 that included Drake, Montreal Canadiens star P.K. Subban, and Blue Jays Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Marcus Stroman, was electric, in full voice from the opening jump ball.When Biyombo missed a free throw late in the third quarter, the fans stood and gave the Raptors big man a rousing cheer. He made the second one, with a smile.Outside, thousands of Raptors fans braved the chilly weather to watch the game on the giant screen in Maple Leaf Square.\u201cI thought our crowd carried us through the times we were tired, that\u2019s why we earned homecourt advantage,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThat kept us going.\u201dThe Raptors, who won Games 2, 3 and 5, dropped an ugly 101-83 decision in Indiana on Friday to force a seventh game.The Raptors looked solid in the first quarter, and backed by 13 points from DeRozan, took a 28-23 lead into the second.Powell pushed the pace for Toronto in the second with 10 points, including a pair of threes, and the Raptors went into the dressing room at halftime up 50-44.', u'Blue Jays\u2019 Marcus Stroman celebrates birthday with 5-1 win over Tampa Bay RaysST.

The Blue Jays\u2019 opening day starter is 8-0 in 10 starts since returning from knee surgery last year.\u201cA special kid,\u201d Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \u201cHe\u2019s got so many things that he can attack you with. He was on today.\u201dPinch hitter Darwin Barney doubled and Michael Saunders walked to open the ninth against Xavier Cedeno (2-1). Alex Colome entered and walked Josh Donaldson before striking out Jose Bautista.After Edwin Encarnacion hit a tiebreaking RBI grounder, Tulowitzki made it 5-1 on his fifth homer.\u201cHe was great out there. It\u2019s always fun to play behind him. Pitches with that intensity.\u201dTulowitzki had been hitless in his previous 10 at-bats in the series and is hitting .172.\u201cThey made a good move to bring in Barney,\u201d Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \u201cHe gets a big hit and you have that feeling, know that those guys coming up get paid to drive in runs. They capitalized and got the big hits.\u201dDonaldson\u2019s ninth homer with one out in the fourth was the Blue Jays\u2019 first hit and put Toronto up 1-0.Evan Longoria tied it at 1 in the sixth on his fifth homer and second in as many days.Jake Odorizzi gave up one run and two hits over seven innings for the Rays. Since the beginning of the 2014 season, the right-hander has allowed one earned run or fewer in 21 of 34 starts at home.The three Tampa Bay starters in the series \u2013 Drew Smyly, Chris Archer and Odorizzi \u2013 allowed a combined five hits in 19 innings.Four of the hits were homers.\u201cAs tough as it\u2019s been, to get two out of three against those three pitchers down here you feel pretty good,\u201d Gibbons said.Toronto had 15 hits, including eight homers in the series to become the first major league team to be held to 15 or fewer hits and hit eight or more homers in a three-game series.Blue Jays: RHP Bo Schultz (left hip surgery) gave up three runs, three hits and walked two while getting two outs in his second rehab appearance Saturday night for Class A Dunedin.Rays C Hank Conger stopped a stretch where 48 consecutive runners had successfully stole a base against him when he threw out Ezequiel Carrera at second in the fifth.

They had the best odds to win the top pick at\xa020 per cent.The Leafs haven\u2019t picked first since 1985 when they selected Wendel Clark.The Winnipeg Jets\xa0and the Columbus Blue Jackets\xa0will pick second and third overall respectively.The Jets\xa0had a 7.5\xa0percent chance of winning the draft lottery which was held Saturday night in Toronto.\t\t\t\n\t\tThe top pick is\xa0expected to be\xa0Auston Matthews. The American centre spent last season playing with the ZSC lions of the Swiss National league where he scored 24 goals and 22 assists in 36 games.With , there was a 50-50 chance a team from the Great White North would land the top pick.Taking things a step further, when you add up each Canadian team\u2019s chances of taking the top pick, there was a 78.5 per cent chance the pick was coming to Canada.As for the rest of the Canadian teams, the Edmonton Oilers will pick 4th, the Vancouver Canucks 5th, the Calgary Flames 6th, the\xa0Montreal Canadiens 9th, and the Ottawa Senators will pick\xa012th.The 2016 NHL Entry Draft will be held on June 24-25 in Buffalo, N.Y.', u'\u2018Win or go home\u2019: Raptors hitting reset button ahead of Game 7TORONTO \u2013 A day after the Toronto Raptors\u2019 four-game sweep by the Washington Wizards in last year\u2019s playoffs, Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan talked.They vowed they\u2019d never again have to feel that stinging pain of a season that ended too soon.Sunday, the Raptors\u2019 all-stars and close friends put their word on the line when they host the Indiana Pacers in a Game 7 that has huge implications for the Toronto franchise.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Super Bowl,\u201d Lowry said Saturday. \u201cWin or go home. It\u2019s one game. Survive or don\u2019t survive. Gotta win. Gotta win.\u201dThe Raptors practised Saturday less than 24 hours after a humiliating 101-83 loss to the Pacers in Indiana that evened the series at three wins apiece.The Raptors are searching for just their second playoff series win in franchise history, a woeful streak that goes back to 2001.They lost in a heart-breaking seven games to Brooklyn two years ago, and then suffered the ugly sweep last season.\u201cThat\u2019s how we have to approach it. It\u2019s what you live for, getting these moments to have the opportunity to have a new feeling that his franchise hasn\u2019t experienced in awhile. It\u2019s time for us to go out and take advantage of why we have home-court advantage.\u201dDeRozan, who along with Lowry has struggled mightily in this series, said a Game 7 feels \u201clike life or death.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only experienced it from a losing aspect, and that feeling sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time after, just to be able to turn on the TV to watch a basketball game, that part of it sucks, and everything that comes with it. Understanding once we go out there tomorrow night, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve got to treat it. Everything else we\u2019ll figure out after that last second runs off the clock.\u201dLowry and DeRozan know that despite roaring to their best regular-season in franchise history \u2013 56 wins and a first-ever No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference \u2013 the results of Sunday\u2019s Game 7 will ultimately define their season.\u201cYes,\u201d DeRozan said, then quickly switched gears. \u201cIf (Sunday) don\u2019t go. . . I don\u2019t even want to put that negative energy out there, because that\u2019s not how we think. We\u2019re going out there thinking we won our division, we won 56 games for a reason, to have home-court advantage, and we\u2019re going out there to take advantage of it.\u201d\t\t\t\n\t\tDeRozan and Lowry, who\u2019d been so solid all season \u2013 touted as the second-best backcourt in the league behind Golden State\u2019s Steph Curry and Klay Thompson \u2013 have had a rough series. Their 44.7 points a night combined over the previous 82 games has dropped to 30.1 points against the Pacers. Their 44 per cent shooting has plummeted to 32.The message at Saturday\u2019s practice was: hit the reset button.\u201cI don\u2019t care what happened (Games) 1 through 6. I don\u2019t care.I\u2019m shooting 31 (per cent), I don\u2019t care,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI\u2019m shooting zero per cent right now. I\u2019ve got a clear empty clip.\u201dRaptors coach Dwane Casey believes this is a different team than the previous two playoff squads. He called them more resilient, grittier, and better able to respond when their \u201cbacks are against the wall.\u201dLast season, Casey said they were \u201clooking for Exit Stage Right.\u201d\u201cThis year I don\u2019t sense any of that,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI sense fight. Guys understand what this is about, and they\u2019re not afraid of the moment.\u201dCasey said the mood at practice was positive and focused, no hanging heads or slumped shoulders.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to push the reset button. Flush what has happened in this series,\u201d said Casey, whose job arguably could depend on Sunday\u2019s outcome. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go and do what you\u2019ve done for 82 games. . . . And stay together, don\u2019t fragment, don\u2019t listen to the noise. The most important person is sitting next to you. Play for him, play for that guy sitting next to you, and stick with the guy next to you.\u201dDeRozan, whose future in Toronto is also on the line Sunday he\u2019ll become a free agent this summer, called Game 7 the biggest of his career.\u201cYeah by far. It\u2019ll be the funnest one. Everything. It could be everything and one,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the beauty of it, honestly, just to have that opportunity. A lot of people don\u2019t have this opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s big, and it could be one that could be talked about a long time from now. But it\u2019s going to be fun. It\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201dSunday\u2019s winner advances to the conference semifinals where they\u2019ll meet either Charlotte or Miami.', u'Oilers have 13.5% chance of getting first pick in 2016 NHL draftIt\u2019s draft lottery day in the National Hockey League and no team is more familiar with picking first than the Edmonton Oilers.Mathematically, the Oilers have the second-best chance to win number one again Saturday, for the fifth time in seven years.\u201cI\u2019d like to obviously see them get lucky one more time,\u201d one fan said, \u201cand have full confidence in Chiarelli, etc.\xa0to make the moves and make Edmonton a powerhouse again.\u201d\u201cI think they are going to get either two or three and they could trade it away actually,\u201d another fan\xa0added. \u201cThere are bigger issues in the locker room and other issues on the roster and I don\u2019t think the first round pick solves any of that.\u201dWhile Toronto has the best odds for first pick, some fans wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Edmonton scored big again.Last year, the Oilers picked Connor McDavid. This year, Auston Matthews is widely considered the best player available.\u201cThe Oilers actually have a better chance of winning this year than last year,\u201d Reid Wilkins, host of Inside Sports and the pre-game show for Oilers Hockey on 630 CHED, said.This year, for the first time, the top three picks will be chosen through the draft lottery.So, could there be any benefit to not getting the\xa0first overall pick?\u201cThere are some Oilers fans who realize, \u2018OK, we won the one lottery you really wanted to win last year, so you\u2019ve got to be thankful for that.\u2019 And this year, with those top three players \u2013 Auston Matthews is a centre, the same position as McDavid, then there\u2019s the two Finish wingers. Some Oilers fans are saying, \u2018oh man, wouldn\u2019t it be great to get slotted in two?\u2019 Because (Patrik) Laine\xa0is a really dynamic winger and\xa0(Jesse) Puljujarvi is really good too. What if somebody else was drawn first and we were drawn second or third and then it\u2019s a little less complicated. We just take the winger.\u201dCould the Oilers trade a top pick for another potential asset?\u201cIf they got the top pick and they really wanted a winger, could they swap with the team that gets number two plus maybe get an experienced defenceman off that team\u2019s roster? That\u2019s maybe a scenario,\u201d Wilkins said.Odds for the 14 teams to land the first pick Saturday in the 2016\xa0National Hockey League draft, June 24-25 in Buffalo, N.Y.:1. Toronto, 20.0%2.

Lowry had 10 assists but just 10 points on 4-for-14 shooting. DeRozan had eight points on a 3-for-13 shooting night.Game 7 goes Sunday in Toronto.The Raptors roared out to an early 12-point lead, but by the end of a horrible third quarter, it had turned into an eight-point deficit, and they trailed 71-64 going into the fourth.Then things got ugly in a hurry. The Pacers reeled off a lightning-quick 13-0 run to take a 19-point lead just over two minutes into the fourth quarter that had the hundreds of Raptors fans in attendance sitting in stunned silence.Then it got worse. The Pacers continued to pour in one shot after another, to the delight of Pacers fans, and the Raptors seemed helpless to stop them. When George scored on a long jumper with 3:27 to play, it put the Pacers up by 26 points, and prompted fans to chant \u201cU-S-A!\u201dThe Pacers shot 46 per cent on the night, to Toronto\u2019s 36, and held a narrow 44-40 rebounding advantage over the Raptors.Coming off last season\u2019s disastrous four-game opening-round sweep by Washington, the subtext all season long has been: Can the Raptors win a playoff series? The answer will come Sunday.The Raptors have just one series win in their 21-year history, in 2001 versus the New York Knicks.Coach Dwane Casey said his team wouldn\u2019t be distracted by thoughts of past post-season disappointments.\t\t\t\n\t\t\u201cRight now, today, the first quarter, second quarter, each possession, it\u2019s far more important,\u201d Casey said before tipoff. \u201cThat\u2019s what I try to get our players to lock in on, and not the heavy burden of history.\u201dOnce again, hundreds of Raptors fans made the trek from Toronto to Indy, \u201cthe heart of basketball country\u201d according to the game announcer, a place steeped in basketball tradition.Their presence made for a raucous atmosphere at Bankers Life Fieldhouse with duelling chants and non-stop noise. There was a smattering of boos before the singing of \u201cO Canada.\u201d Large pockets of Raptors red broke up the backdrop of yellow Pacers T-shirts.Among those in attendance: long-time Pacer Rik Smits, comedian Mike Epps, and Brazilian race car driver Tony Kanaan.The Pacers took aim at Toronto\u2019s \u201cWe The North\u201d slogan with their own \u201cWe The Gold\u201d campaign, which was written on the yellow T-shirts given to fans, under the words \u201cUNITED STATE OF BASKETBALL.\u201dCasey had been preaching a strong start for Game 6 after woeful first quarters in Games 4 and 5. The Raptors were clearly listening, roaring out to a 12-point lead in the first quarter behind nine points from Carroll. The Pacers pulled to within 22-20 going into the second.The Pacers tied it up midway through the second quarter, but the Raptors would go up by eight before taking a 44-40 advantage into halftime.The Raptors\u2019 defence disappeared in the third, as they gave up 31 points to Indiana.The Raptors won Games 2, 3 and 5, while Indiana took Games 1 and 4.\xa0', u'After draft disaster Tunsil\u2019s comments on receiving cash being investigatedLaremy Tunsil said enough about Mississippi at the NFL draft for the university to launch an investigation into his time at the school. Now, the former Rebel offensive lineman only wants to talk about his new team, the Miami Dolphins.That leaves Ole Miss in a difficult position.Tunsil said at the draft Thursday night in Chicago that he accepted money from a member of the football staff while playing at the school.His comments prompted the university to issue a statement Friday saying it is \u201caware of the reports from the NFL Draft regarding Laremy Tunsil and potential NCAA violations during his time at Ole Miss\u201d and \u201cwill aggressively investigate and fully co-operate with the NCAA and the SEC.\u201dAfter Tunsil was selected 13th overall by the Dolphins, he initially denied taking money while at Ole Miss.The question arose after a post on his Instagram showed an alleged text message exchange between the offensive lineman and an Ole Miss football staff member that included Tunsil\u2019s request for money for bills.When Tunsil was pressed about whether he took money, he said, \u201cI\u2019d have to say yeah.\u201dTunsil made no attempt to clarify his draft-night comments during Friday\u2019s introductory news conference with the Dolphins. The news conference was delayed more than hour because Tunsil said he had an allergic reaction, possibly to something he ate.When asked directly about the text messages to the Ole Miss staff member, Tunsil said, \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about the Miami Dolphins.\u201dIf there\u2019s no help from Tunsil regarding potential NCAA violations \u2013 and he\u2019s under no obligation to talk to the governing body since his college career is over \u2013 Ole Miss will be charged with investigating the matter on its own.Ole Miss athletic director Ross Bjork told The Associated Press in a text message that the school couldn\u2019t comment further because it was \u201cworking on getting answers to all of this.\u201d\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tOle Miss is already under a current NCAA investigation and received a Notice of Allegations from the governing body in January regarding violations in football, women\u2019s basketball and track and field.The university has not disclosed the violations the NCAA said it has committed, but Tunsil was suspended seven games last season after the NCAA ruled he received several illegal benefits, including the use of three loaner cars.With Tunsil acknowledging taking money while at Ole Miss, it\u2019s unclear how the NCAA will handle the new information. The NCAA could delay the current case while it and Ole Miss conduct investigations, or it could start a new case against the university.NCAA spokeswoman Emily James said Friday morning in an email response to the AP that the NCAA does not \u201ccomment on current, pending or potential investigations.\u201dThe current case recently received a 30-day extension and a response from Ole Miss is due in late May.North Carolina\u2019s current NCAA case tied to its long-running academic fraud scandal was delayed eight months when the school reported additional information for the NCAA to review.Tunsil became the story of the draft after he said his social media accounts were hacked and incidents of his troubled past became public minutes before the first round began, including a video of him smoking from a gas mask-bong contraption.\xa0\t\t\t\n\t\tTunsil said Thursday that he believes both of the social media accounts were hacked, but it\u2019s unclear if that was actually the case.Jason Pack, spokesman for the FBI in Mississippi, said \u201cthe FBI is not currently involved in the matter and has not heard from anyone involved in the incident.\u201dThe 6-foot-5, 310-pound Tunsil, who started at left tackle for the Rebels over the past three seasons, helped Ole Miss win 10 games last year, including the Sugar Bowl.Tunsil\u2019s troubles cast a dark cloud over a historic night for Ole Miss; it was the first time the school had three players selected in the first round of the draft.After Tunsil was drafted, receiver Laquon Treadwell was selected by the Minnesota Vikings with the 23rd overall pick and defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche went to the Arizona Cardinals at No. 29.', u'Indiana Pacers troll Toronto Raptors with \u2018We the Gold\u2019 campaign ahead of Game 6INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The Indiana Pacers have come up with a counter to Toronto\u2019s \u201cWe the North\u201d campaign.The Raptors are unimpressed.The Pacers\u2019 T-shirts for Game 6 in Indianapolis read \u201cUNITED STATE OF BASKETBALL,\u201d over the hashtag \u201cWe The Gold.\u201d\u201cWho the gold?\u201d\u2018 DeMar DeRozan said with a head shake Friday morning. \u201cI don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not going to wear it.\u201dPatrick Patterson was far more vocal about the Pacers\u2019 tactics after practice Thursday.\u201cJust because we do \u2018We The North,\u2019 they just trying to find some thing to get at us,\u201d he said.\xa0\u201cI have different feelings toward that \u2026 Flattering? No, not at all.\u201dPatterson praised Raptors fans, saying \u201cThe Canadian fans, they sing the national anthem with pride. They\u2019ve done it for a long time and they do it every single opportunity they get, whether it\u2019s regular season, whether it\u2019s pre-season, whether it\u2019s playoffs, whether the singer allows them to sing it and holds the mic up in the air, they\u2019re constantly singing it.\u201cIn Indiana, or when we go on the road, the Canadian fans are there in the crowd, they\u2019re singing along to the national anthem, they\u2019re proud. And then I feel like the Pacer fans \u2026 they just do it because we did it. They try to do it to be loud or be obnoxious.\u201dHundreds of Raptors fans were expected at Friday night\u2019s game. Hours before tipoff they could be seen wandering the downtown mall, in restaurants, or riding rental bikes along the canal.An estimated 1,700 fans made the trip from Toronto for Game 4 in Indianapolis \u2013 an ugly 100-83 Raptors loss.Indianapolis Star columnist Gregg Doyel wrote about the Raptors\u2019 fans in his Friday column.\u201cThey are loud, and they are coming. Those basketball fans in Toronto, they\u2019re not normal,\u201d Doyel wrote. \u201cThey are NFL fans with an NBA team. They travel. They drink. They scream.\u201dThe Raptors\u2019 \u201cWe the North\u201d campaign is in its third season.Game 7 of the series, if necessary, will go Sunday in Toronto.']
