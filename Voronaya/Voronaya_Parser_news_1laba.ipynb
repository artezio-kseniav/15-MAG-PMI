       " u'Japan\\u2019s Prime Minister ups pressure on Trudeau over TPPTOKYO \\u2013 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe upped the pressure Tuesday on Justin Trudeau by publicly suggesting his Canadian counterpart\\u2019s positions had budged on a pair of prickly international files.Following a bilateral meeting with the visiting Canadian prime minister in Tokyo, Abe read a statement to reporters saying the two leaders shared \\u201cserious concern\\u201d about the territorial dispute that involved the \\u201cbuilding of outposts\\u201d in the South China Sea.Abe also said, through an interpreter, that Japan would continue to make efforts to seek early ratification of the controversial  treaty \\u2014 \\u201ctogether with Canada.\\u201dBut Canada\\u2019s interpretation of the meeting was somewhat different on those two issues.\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tTrudeau initially made no mention of the contentious South China Sea dispute in remarks Tuesday that followed Abe\\u2019s. As for the TPP, the government has made clear it is taking its time to review the 12-country Pacific Rim trade agreement before deciding to ratify.Japan is embroiled in an ongoing territorial dispute with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea. China has been constructing islands despite the concerns of several Asian countries with territorial claims in the area.Last winter, Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida issued a statement confirming their commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in international maritime law.Without naming China, they also said they opposed the use of intimidation, force or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo in the Asia-Pacific.Late Tuesday, Trudeau spokeswoman Kate Purchase said in an email that \\u201cthere is no change in our position on the South China Sea.\\u201d She reiterated Canada\\u2019s position, saying: \\u201cAs we have said consistently, we believe in the rule of law and discourage any unilateral actions.\\u201dKeio University law professor Masayuki Tadokoro said Abe may have been trying to \\u201cextract\\u201d extra support from Trudeau on an issue that represents a real security threat for the Japanese.\\u201cAbe may have exaggerated the level of support he got out of the bilateral meeting for domestic consumption,\\u201d said Tadokoro.Trudeau may have been trying to steer clear of the issue \\u201cin the fear of undermining its relations with Chinese,\\u201d he added.Tadokoro said while there\\u2019s no way to know what Abe and Trudeau actually said to each other, \\u201cit is not uncommon in diplomacy that things are deliberately left for convenient interpretations of both sides.\\u201dKenjiro Monji, Japan\\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in recent interview that on security issues Canada has long kept its attention toward Europe and the south because it is an Atlantic state.Monji said Canada is also a Pacific nation, but Canadians\\u2019 renewed focus on Asia has primarily been through \\u201ceconomic lenses.\\u201dHe added that Japan has put a lot of importance on TPP and hopes to ratify it as soon as possible.Trudeau repeated his government\\u2019s long-held position Tuesday that the TPP was still subject to a thorough, cross-country review.The TPP was negotiated by the former Conservative government and the Liberals have yet to signal whether they will ratify it.But the future of the TPP is in doubt. U.S. presidential hopefuls from both major parties have said they would reject the deal if elected.On Tuesday, Trudeau focused on boosting Canada\\u2019s economic ties to Japan. He personally invited Japanese auto executives to invest more in Canada.\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tBut it appeared his efforts in Tokyo wouldn\\u2019t immediately secure concrete commitments from the auto industry.Trudeau met with parts manufacturers and the presidents of three auto companies: Honda, Toyota and Subaru.The CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries, the firm that makes Subaru, told Trudeau he doesn\\u2019t have any plans to expand capacity in the near term, though he might in the future, the prime minister\\u2019s press secretary Cameron Ahmad said after the meeting.There were no announcements of imminent deals with the others, either.\\u201cI am very much in the relationship-building mode,\\u201d Trudeau told a news conference in Tokyo when asked whether the meetings would yield firm results.As part of his pitch, the prime minister also told Yoshinaga that Canadians are innovative and focused on quality.He later described the meetings as \\u201csuccessful.\\u201dEarlier Tuesday, Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, visited the Meiji Shrine, met with the emperor and empress of Japan and had dinner with Abe.Trudeau\\u2019s Tokyo visit came ahead of the Group of Seven summit on Thursday and Friday in Japan\\u2019s Ise-Shima region.',\n",
       " u'Drunk driving convictions keep engineer off the road but not off busy rail lineNEW YORK \\u2013 An engineer is operating trains along the third-largest commuter railroad in the United States, even though his driver\\u2019s license has been suspended for 10 years because of a history of driving while intoxicated.New Jersey Transit engineer Thomas Broschart\\u2019s license was suspended in 2007 for a decade, and he has someone pick him up from work because he isn\\u2019t legally allowed to drive a car, according to an investigation by . But federal law doesn\\u2019t require him to have a motor vehicle driver\\u2019s license to operate a train.\\u201cYou don\\u2019t need a driver\\u2019s license,\\u201d Broschart said. \\u201cOne has nothing to do with the other.\\u201dNJ Transit said it\\u2019s following the law but would welcome stricter regulations.\\u201cFederal law governing engineers sets forth specific regulations in dealing with DWI cases involving engineers and we are obligated to follow those Federal Railroad Administration rules,\\u201d NJ Transit said in a statement Tuesday. \\u201cThe code was strictly adhered to and the engineer is certified to operate locomotives according to federal law.\\u201dWhen asked whether his supervisors know that his driver\\u2019s license was revoked, Broschart responded, \\u201cAbsolutely. Everybody knows.\\u201dIn 1995, Broschart\\u2019s license was suspended for two years because he refused to have his blood-alcohol level tested, the TV station reported. In 1999, his license was suspended for a year for driving while intoxicated, and in 2001, his license was suspended for not complying with a mandatory alcohol program.U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez said it was \\u201cpretty alarming\\u201d that Broschart can transport commuters but can\\u2019t legally drive to and from work. The New Jersey Democrat has asked his staff to contact the Federal Railroad Administration to determine whether a law needs to be changed.NJ Transit said, \\u201cAnything that could be done to strengthen those federal rules and protect our customers and employees would be welcome.\\u201d',\n",
       " u'Dozens of real estate companies fail to comply with anti-money-laundering lawsTORONTO \\u2013 At least 85 real estate companies have not implemented a plan showing how they are trying to detect money laundering and other suspicious transactions, nearly 15 years after they were required to do so, according to data obtained by The Canadian Press.The federal anti-money laundering agency received 337 compliance reports from roughly 1,000 companies in the real estate sector it surveyed \\u2014 including brokers, sales representatives and developers \\u2014 between Jan. 1, 2013, and Feb. 8, 2016.The data, which was obtained through an access-to-information request, represents only a small sampling of the real estate industry. There are about 20,000 companies in the real estate sector that are required to report to Fintrac.An analysis of the data contained in those reports found that roughly a quarter of the 337 respondents admitted they had not yet fully implemented a compliance regime, which has been required by federal anti-money laundering laws since 2001.Thirty-eight of the companies said they had only partially implemented a compliance regime, while the other 47 said they had not even begun to do so. The names of the companies were not included in the documents.Fintrac spokesman Darren Gibb says some of the reports weren\\u2019t sent back because the companies no longer exist, while others simply failed to respond.Fintrac routinely sends out compliance reports to various sectors to gather information about the companies it regulates, says Gibb.Those reports can sometimes lead to further enforcement actions such as on-site examinations, he says.\\u201cIf we see an assessment report come back and it\\u2019s clear that the entity is not where they should be, then certainly that\\u2019s a flag for us that it may be examination-worthy,\\u201d says Gibb.\\u201cOr conversely, if we don\\u2019t get an assessment report coming back, that\\u2019s potentially an even bigger flag.\\u201dIf violations are discovered during an examination, that could lead to fines of up to $100,000 per violation for individuals and up to $500,000 per violation for companies, depending on severity.Gibb was unable to specify how many of the 85 companies that did not have a compliance plan were fined, noting that the reports are only one factor that the agency considers when deciding whether to investigate a particular firm.The largest number of firms that admitted they have yet to finish implementing a compliance regime was in Quebec, where there were 32 such companies.Gibb said he could not speculate as to why the figure was higher in Quebec than in other provinces.In Ontario, 19 firms said they hadn\\u2019t fully implemented a compliance regime, while in Alberta there were 12 such cases. Eight of the B.C. real estate firms surveyed reported that they hadn\\u2019t finished setting up a compliance regime.Meanwhile, 43 of the companies surveyed nationwide said they had not yet appointed a compliance officer, as required by law.Ottawa also requires companies subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to have a system in place for training their employees on how to comply with the law.The data obtained by The Canadian Press found that 42 of the 337 companies surveyed by Fintrac had only started implementing a training system, while 57 had not even begun yet.Pierre Leduc, a spokesman for the Canadian Real Estate Association, says keeping up with the changes to anti-money laundering laws is a challenge for the real estate sector because most realtors work on their own and are not big corporations like banks or casinos.\\u201cIn addition, until recently, awareness was low, which is why CREA embarked on a national information tour to raise awareness and explain compliance responsibilities,\\u201d Leduc said in an email.',\n",
       " u'WestJet move part of broader telecommuting pushMONTREAL \\u2013 Like many Canadians, Carla Holub has gladly given up commuting for the ease and comfort of working from home.The 41-year-old WestJet sales agent says she has no regrets since she made the change three years ago. Telecommuting affords her the time to take her children to dance lessons and hockey while reducing her lunch, coffee, gas and car insurance costs, she says.\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a great switch,\\u201d she said from Calgary. \\u201cIt just freed up a good two hours of my personal time being able to work from my home office.\\u201dWestJet Airlines plans to establish a bilingual call centre in Moncton, N.B., but most of the 400 agents will work from home. They will join about 85 per cent of the airline\\u2019s 900 call centre workers in Calgary who since 2013 have shifted to fielding customer calls remotely.The move has saved WestJet the cost of expanding its office to accommodate its growing staff, though that is partially offset by expenses to buy extra computers for employees so that they can work from home.Spokesman Robert Palmer said the transition was mainly designed to respond to workers who desire a better work-life balance.\\u201cFrom an employer\\u2019s perspective, generally speaking it makes for a happier employee and a happier employee is generally more productive,\\u201d he said.The shift to telecommuting has accelerated since the 1990s growth of technology, said Sheryl Boswell, director of marketing for job website Monster Canada.She said most companies that allow employees to work from home are looking to build their businesses without added office expenses. They are also seeking access to a broader talent pool, she said.\\u201cI think more employers are doing it because this is what seekers today demand,\\u201d said Boswell, who herself telecommutes two days a week.More than 1.7 million paid employees \\u2014 those not self-employed \\u2014 worked from home in 2008 at least once a week, up almost 23 per cent from the 1.4 million in 2000, according to the latest Statistics Canada report on the subject in 2010.Despite the increase, the proportion of paid employees working from home grew by just one percentage point to 11.2 per cent during the period. A faster pace of growth among self-employed pushed the total proportion of people working from home up two percentage points to 19 per cent in 2008.Louise Howard is typical of those many self-employed home workers. The mother of children aged six and eight spends a few hours a day sewing clothing and accessories for children from her dining room that she sells online and to neighbourhood stores.\\u201cIt\\u2019s more a hobby that\\u2019s become a business by accident,\\u201d said the Montrealer, who says she makes about minimum wage for an average of three hours per day.Monster Canada says nearly 5,000 home-based employment positions are currently listed on its website, up 18 per cent from last year. Available positions vary from customer service and sales representatives to tech support, finance and real estate services. The growth of social media has also pushed companies to hire writers to create content.Telecommuting can also appeal to older workers, allowing businesses to adapt to changing demographics.\\u201cIt\\u2019s a weapon in a company\\u2019s arsenal to attract great employees,\\u201d said Robert Campbell, president of trade association ContactNB.About 30 per cent of New Brunswick\\u2019s more than 100 call centres allow some form of telecommuting, Campbell said, adding that the workers have a range of jobs that include medical telecare, grief counselling, funeral planning and financial advice.',\n",
       " u'Justin Trudeau heads to Japan to talk trade, investmentsJustin Trudeau makes his first major push into Asia this week in Japan, where he hopes to broaden business links with a country that was once Canada\\u2019s No. 2 trading partner.The prime minister will depart Sunday for his first overseas bilateral visit since taking office last fall.He will meet early in the week in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the emperor and empress as well as leaders in the automotive sector.The visit comes ahead of Trudeau\\u2019s participation in the Group of Seven summit, on Thursday and Friday, in the Japanese city of Ise-Shima.But before Trudeau sits down with the powerful group of world leaders, he will try to reinvigorate Canada\\u2019s trade and investment relationship with Japan.His office says it believes there is still a lot of fertile ground in Japan and sees it as a key player in a region where the Liberal government intends to expand economic ties.One of the main goals of Trudeau\\u2019s visit will be to try to encourage Japanese auto industry officials to invest more and to keep the plants already in Canada.In his meeting with Abe, Trudeau\\u2019s office said he plans to discuss negotiations on the countries\\u2019 economic partnership agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, security co-operation, education and the Arctic, given Japan\\u2019s relative proximity.The Japanese-Canadian relationship has been a smooth one, but there are still several ways it could be improved.For starters, Japan\\u2019s ambassador in Ottawa notes that fewer than 15 years ago, his country was Canada\\u2019s No. 2 trading partner after the United States.But Kenjiro Monji says Japan\\u2019s trade position with Canada has slipped since 2002.In 2009, he said Japan had tumbled to No. 5 after being passed by China, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The value of trade between Japan and British Columbia fell by 45 per cent between 2000 and 2014, Monji added.The slide, he said, is due to nearly two decades of recession in Japan, China\\u2019s economic boom and the emergence of Canadian trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.Monji believes the bilateral trade could get a boost from a key Canadian energy source that Japan needs: liquefied natural gas.Japan, the world\\u2019s biggest buyer of LNG, is hoping Canada will issue necessary environmental permits to allow companies to export it from British Columbia.B.C. Premier Christy Clark recently told The Canadian Press it\\u2019s time to proceed given the approval process started more than three years ago.\\u201cCanada is one of the most-promising potential exporters to Japan because \\u2026 liquefied natural gas occupies a still very important share in our energy policy,\\u201d said Monji, who noted that Japanese companies are involved in several LNG projects in Canada.Japan is also expected to tout the benefits for Canada of the , a huge, 12-country treaty that would deepen trade connections across the Asia-Pacific region.The pact, which Canada is reviewing, includes the major economies of Japan and the United States.The controversial, yet-to-be-ratified TPP, negotiated by the former Conservative government, has raised concerns in several Canadian industries.\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tThe future of the TPP is in doubt. U.S. presidential hopefuls from both the Democrats and Republicans have said they would reject the treaty.With the TPP still pending, Monji doesn\\u2019t expect any movement on talks of a bilateral Canada-Japan trade deal.He did praise the Canda-Japan relationship and was quick to point out this will be Trudeau and Abe\\u2019s third meeting in six months. They sat down together at the APEC summit in Manila and again in Washington for a nuclear safety talks.Japan is also expected to raise the issue of regional security with Canada, particularly the ongoing territorial disputes with China in the East China Sea and South China Sea.Masayuki Tadokoro, a Keio University law professor, said Japan will scrutinize Trudeau\\u2019s words on the matter, even though Canada may not want to take very strong position due its economic interests in China.\\u201cPerhaps it\\u2019s very difficult for many Canadians and Europeans to understand, but for Japanese, China represents a real security threat.\\u201dOverall, there are few entanglements between Canada and Japan, but they do have a trade relationship many believe has unrealized potential, says David Welch, CIGI chair of global security at the Balsillie School of International Affairs.Welch said it\\u2019s partly due to the complexities of selling in Japan and the fact Canada has put more focus in recent years on trade with Latin America and Europe.\\u201cNow, the Japanese have huge hopes that Trudeau will bring Canada back. I hear this all the time, not just from Japan, but from other countries in the region, too.\\u201d\\xa0',\n",
       " u'How knowing how much homes sell for could make it easier for you to buy a home in CanadaBuying a home may soon be a bit less stressful for Canadians\\xa0thanks to a\\xa0precedent-setting ruling that could force real estate boards to hand over data on home sales and in turn make buying a home more transparent.In April, \\xa0in a long-standing dispute over access to home sales data. The tribunal ruled the TREB\\xa0was creating unfair competition and keeping prices high by keeping data \\u2013 like how much money a\\xa0home sold for \\u2013 private.By only providing that data to personal clients, the tribunal ruled  \\u201cnew and innovative real estate brokerage services using the Internet.\\u201dTREB maintains that it limits access to this data to ensure the privacy of its buyers and sellers.While it\\u2019s not yet clear what type of data will be released, many brokerages believe the ruling could set a precedent for other real estate boards in Canada to release their home sales data.And that has the potential to make the entire home buying experience a lot less stressful for Canadians.Currently, Canadian real estate sales data isn\\u2019t very \\u201cGoogle-able.\\u201d \\xa0From trip planning, to finding a new restaurant for dinner, nearly everyone takes to the Internet, or an app, to research before committing to an idea (especially when money is involved).Sure, it\\u2019s easy enough to look up list prices for houses in your preferred neighbourhood \\u2013 but what you really want to know is the final selling price of those houses.This is especially important in  \\u2013 Toronto and Vancouver \\u2013 , where homes are purposely under-priced to drive up prices. A recent report by the CBC showed that the Rokham Fard, , said if selling prices were more accessible, consumers would have more insight into what they can actually afford.\\u201cYou could inform the buyer that based on prior data the seller has listed the home at a lower price point, based on what other homes in the area have sold for,\\u201d Fard told Global News.\\u201cThen you wouldn\\u2019t get mentally drained from going into all of these bidding wars.\\u201dRecognizing the potential power of this data, Toronto\\u2019s Spring Reality is working on a database that will predict what homes might sell for using past sales data.\\u201cWhat we want to do is stop wasting people\\u2019s time,\\u201d said Mamourian. \\u201cWe want to narrow down on the number of people with a $700,000 budget looking at properties that sell for over $800,000.\\u201dBut Mamourian\\u2019s team can\\u2019t move forward with their project until the tribunal provides more information about what data TREB should release.Meanwhile other real estate startups are turning to crowdsourcing.Take for example RedDoor \\u2013  by crowdsourcing selling data from home buyers themselves.RedDoor allows users to compare estimated property values by neighbourhood, right down to a specific street.

       " u'Fort McMurray wildfire to have modest economic effect: fedsOTTAWA \\u2013 Finance Minister Bill Morneau says he expects the Alberta wildfires to have a relatively modest impact on the broader economy.Morneau also says the economic fallout from the disaster will be largely contained to the current quarter of the fiscal year.A huge wildfire forced the evacuation of Fort McMurray as well as the shutdown of some economically important oilsands operations.The blaze also destroyed 2,400 buildings in Fort McMurray.Morneau says investments over the coming months in response to the wildfire will not only help the people of Fort McMurray \\u2014 they will also help the economy bounce back.He says the government\\u2019s initial focus was the human challenge, such as the matching of charitable donations.Morneau made the comments during a conference call to reporters.

       "[u'Riot breaks out at Donald Trump rally in New MexicoALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \\u2013 Protests outside a Donald Trump rally in New Mexico turned violent Tuesday night as demonstrators threw burning T-shirts, plastic bottles and other items at police officers, overturned trash cans and knocked down barricades.Authorities responded by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades into the crowd outside the Albuquerque Convention Center in what police later called a \\u201criot.\\u201dDuring the rally, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, who shouted, held up banners and resisted removal by security officers.The banners included the messages \\u201cTrump is Fascist\\u201d and \\u201cWe\\u2019ve heard enough.\\u201dAt one point, a female protester was physically dragged from the stands by security. Other protesters scuffled with security as they resisted removal from the convention centre, which was packed with thousands of loud and cheering Trump supporters.Trump responded with his usual bluster, instructing security to remove the protesters and mocking their actions by telling them to \\u201cGo home to mommy.\\u201dHe responded to one demonstrator by asking, \\u201cHow old is this kid?\\u201d Then he provided his own answer: \\u201cStill wearing diapers.\\u201dTrump\\u2019s supporters responded with chants of \\u201cBuild that wall!\\u201dThe altercations left glass at the entrance of the convention centre smashed.During the rally, protesters outside overran barricades and clashed with police in riot gear. They also burned T-shirts and other items labeled with Trump\\u2019s catchphrase, \\u201cMake America Great Again.\\u201dTuesday marked Trump\\u2019s first stop in New Mexico, the nation\\u2019s most Hispanic state. Gov. Susana Martinez, head of the Republican Governors Association and the nation\\u2019s only Latina governor, has harshly criticized his remarks on immigrants and has attacked his proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The governor did not attend the rally and has yet to make an endorsement.Trump read off a series of negative statistics about the state, including an increase in the number of people on food stamps.The governor\\u2019s office fired back, saying Martinez has fought for welfare reform.\\u201cThe potshots weren\\u2019t about policy, they were about politics,\\u201d said spokesman Michael Lonergan. \\u201cAnd the Governor will not be bullied into supporting a candidate until she is convinced that candidate will fight for New Mexicans, and she did not hear that today.\\u201dREAD MORE:\\xa0Trump supporters at the rally said they appreciated his stance on boosting border security and stemming the flow of people crossing the border illegally, but some said they were frightened by the violent protests outside.Albuquerque attorney Doug Antoon said rocks were flying through the convention centre windows as he was leaving Tuesday night. Glass was breaking and landing near his feet.Albuquerque police said several officers were treated for injuries after getting hit by rocks thrown by protesters. At least one person was arrested from the riot, police said.Karla Molinar, a University of New Mexico student, said she participated in disrupting Trump\\u2019s speech because she felt he was attacking members of her family who are living in the country illegally.

       " u'Provincial medical regulators set detailed guidelines for doctor-assisted dyingOTTAWA \\u2013 Medical regulators in every province have issued detailed guidelines doctors must follow to help suffering patients end their lives once Canada\\u2019s ban on medically assisted dying is formally lifted next month.And most of those guidelines impose safeguards similar to \\u2013 or even more stringent than \\u2013 those included in the federal government\\u2019s proposed new law on assisted death.The existence of guidelines in every province undercuts federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould\\u2019s contention that there\\u2019ll be a dangerous legal void if the government\\u2019s controversial new law on assisted dying isn\\u2019t enacted by June 6.That\\u2019s the date on which the Supreme Court\\u2019s landmark ruling last year, striking down the ban on medically assisted dying, goes into effect. The court suspended the ruling for 16 months to give the federal government time to enact a new law that allows assisted dying for clearly consenting adults with \\u201cgrievous and irremediable\\u201d medical conditions who are enduring suffering that is intolerable to them.Wilson-Raybould and Health Minister Jane Philpott have issued seemingly contradictory warnings about the dire consequences that will unfold if the proposed legislation isn\\u2019t in force by June 6 \\u2013 a feat that seems increasingly unlikely.They maintain assisted death will be readily available without any safeguards to protect the vulnerable. At the same time, they contend many doctors will refuse to provide assistance in dying because of uncertainty about who is eligible.Their arguments are \\u201cfalse,\\u201d says Josh Paterson, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, a plaintiff in the case that led to the Supreme Court striking down the ban on assisted dying.\\u201cNobody is going to be left wondering what they\\u2019re going to do on June 6. Everything in terms of the medical profession is ready to go \\u2026 We\\u2019re not jumping into a void here, we\\u2019re not on the edge of a cliff.\\u201dLike the proposed federal law, most of the various guidelines produced by provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons require that at least two doctors must agree that a patient meets the eligibility criteria for an assisted death, that a patient must submit a written request signed by witnesses, that there be a waiting period between the request and the provision of an assisted death, that a patient must be competent to give free, informed consent throughout the process, up to the time of dying.Some impose more stringent safeguards, for instance putting the age of consent at 19 rather than the federally proposed 18, and requiring a psychiatric assessment in cases where depression or mental illness might impair a patient\\u2019s ability to give consent.The one big difference, said Paterson, is that the provincial guidelines rely on the relatively permissive eligibility criteria spelled out by the Supreme Court whereas the federal government is proposing more restrictive conditions.The legislation would allow assisted death only for consenting adults who are in \\u201can advanced stage of irreversible decline\\u201d from a serious and incurable disease, illness or disability and for whom a natural death is \\u201creasonably foreseeable.\\u201dThe Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada has expressed concern that \\u201creasonably foreseeable\\u201d death is \\u201clegal language that is far too vague\\u201d to enable doctors to confidently determine who is eligible for a medically assisted death.\\u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\\u2026 For all of us, death is reasonably foreseeable,\\u201d Dr. Trevor Theman, registrar of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons and past president of FMRAC, said in an interview.While they struggle to interpret aspects of the Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling as well, Theman said the court\\u2019s eligibility criteria is more manageable for regulators.Yet the federal government has all but ignored the wishes of medical regulators and the guidelines they\\u2019ve produced, citing instead approval of its proposed law by the Canadian Medical Association, which lobbies on behalf of doctors but does not regulate, license or discipline them.\\u201cSo it may be that they see a void (if the legislation isn\\u2019t enacted by June 6) because they\\u2019re not used to dealing with us and they\\u2019re less aware of what we\\u2019re capable of.\\u201dThe three territories do not have independent medical regulatory authorities. However, the Yukon government has issued guidelines for doctors similar to those produced in the provinces and the Northwest Territories government has promised to do the same by June 6.Only Nunavut is waiting to see the final shape of the federal law. Even there, Paterson noted the eligibility criteria laid down by the Supreme Court will still apply, as in the rest of the country.Notwithstanding Wilson-Raybould\\u2019s dire warnings, it seems well nigh impossible for the proposed legislation to be enacted by June 6. Even should the House of Commons pass the bill Monday, the first day back after a break week, that would leave less than a week for the bill to go through all stages of the legislative process in the Senate \\u2013 a rush few senators appear inclined to accommodate.',\n",

In spite of this,\\xa0NDP supporters polled by Ipsos were quite\\xa0forgiving, with 56 per cent willing to give Trudeau a pass.That didn\\u2019t come as a big\\xa0surprise to Darrell Bricker, CEO at Ipsos Global Public Affairs.While had predicted the end of the Liberal \\u201choneymoon\\u201d and speculated Trudeau\\u2019s outburst would lead to a drop\\xa0in his personal\\xa0approval ratings, the poll does not support this.Six in ten Canadians still approve (19 per cent strongly and 43 per cent somewhat) of the performance of the Liberal government under Trudeau, a drop of four points since the last such survey in March.Meanwhile, four in ten Canadians surveyed by Ipsos disapprove of the government\\u2019s performance under Trudeau (17 per cent strongly and 21 per cent somewhat).Other\\xa0polls conducted over the past week have yielded similar results. A  survey\\xa0after the elbow incident revealed Trudeau has hit an all-time high in terms of who\\xa0Canadians prefer as prime minister, with nearly 54 per cent of respondents naming him as their favourite. An\\xa0\\xa0poll found that 70 per cent of respondents said the\\xa0elbowing incident had\\xa0no impact on their view of Trudeau.The government also remains\\xa0in a very comfortable position\\xa0when it comes to voting intention.If an election were held tomorrow, the poll indicates that the Liberals would receive 46 per cent of the decided popular vote compared to 30 per cent for the Tories under Rona Ambrose.The NDP and out-going leader Tom Mulcair would receive 15 per cent support. Approximately 4 per cent would go to the Bloc Quebecois, and 5 per cent to the Greens and other parties.\\xa0',\n",

The concern is Canada may not want to take very strong position due its economic interests in China.\\u201cCanada has always been watching toward the east and south because Canada is an Atlantic state,\\u201d Kenjiro Monji, Japan\\u2019s ambassador to Canada, said in an interview last week.\\u201cCanada is also a Pacific nation and it is only recently that Canadians started to look to the west, but only through economic lenses.\\u201dAbe is also expected to urge Trudeau to move quickly to open up Canadian liquefied natural gas exports to Japan.Japan, the world\\u2019s biggest importer of LNG, is hoping Canada will issue necessary environmental permits to allow companies to export it from British Columbia.Monji said LNG is still very important energy source for his country, which makes Canada one of the most promising potential exporters to Japan. He noted that Japanese companies are involved in several LNG projects in Canada.Trudeau\\u2019s Tokyo visit comes ahead of the G7 summit on Thursday and Friday in Ise-Shima.',\n",

Smith to apologize Tuesday night to \\u201call Canadians everywhere\\u201d for doubting the Raptors.\\u201cI can\\u2019t put into words how stunned I am, I can\\u2019t believe what I saw,\\u201d Smith said.\\u201cI gotta be a man of my word and just apologize to Canada, all Canadians everywhere because I certainly thought that this was going back to Cleveland, 3-1 \\xe2\\u20ac\\xa6 with the Cavs closing this series out on Wednesday night so I wouldn\\u2019t have to go back to Canada and go through customs and all that other nonsense.\\u201dSmith called the Raptors winning two straight \\u201cinexplicable.\\u201d\\u201cI can\\u2019t understand what\\u2019s happened to Cleveland right now,\\u201d Smith said. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t resemble the team that has won 10 straight playoff games prior to losing the last two.\\u201dThe key to a win Wednesday, Casey said, is limiting the Cavaliers\\u2019 runs. Game 2 in Cleveland was tied late in the second quarter but the Cavs closed out the half with a brisk 16-2 run. It was a hole too deep for the Raptors to dig out of.\\u201cThe games that we lost there, there were probably three- or four-minute segments, portions of the game that really did us in in both games,\\u201d Casey said. \\u201cIf we can sustain our defence against their runs and not let them blow it open in those three- or four-minute segments. . . and we\\u2019ve got to respond offensively.\\u201dToronto\\u2019s all-star backcourt was superb in Tuesday\\u2019s victory \\u2013 Kyle Lowry had 35 points while DeMar DeRozan added 32.Each has struggled at times these playoffs, but when they\\u2019re both firing on all cylinders, pity the opponent.\\u201cThey\\u2019re always dangerous with the guys they have who can get going at any time,\\u201d said Cleveland\\u2019s backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova. \\u201cOnce they get it going, it\\u2019s hard to stop because they hit tough shots and make plays. It\\u2019s up to us to try to take them out of their rhythm and make it as hard as possible on them.\\u201dCasey hopes to get Jonas Valanciunas into Game 5, but it depends on the Cavs\\u2019 lineup. Valanciunas, who sprained his ankle in Game 3 of the Miami series, rejoined the active roster ahead of Tuesday\\u2019s game, but didn\\u2019t play.\\u201cI know he\\u2019s our starting centre, but it\\u2019s tough to put him out there if they\\u2019re playing Channing Frye big minutes at (centre),\\u201d Casey said. \\u201cWe just have to make sure that he has a matchup and he\\u2019s not out there chasing three-point shooters all around the perimeter.\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to be valuable for us because he is an excellent passer and can make plays from the top of the key.\\u201d',\n",

Point guard Kyrie Irving scored 26 points and added six assists with three rebounds.Few picked the Raptors to steal more than a token win against the Cavs, who roared red-hot into the conference finals having swept Detroit and Atlanta.Toronto dropped Games 1 and 2 in Cleveland by a combined 50 points, and it seemed the Raptors were writing their obituary. But bolstered by the hometown crowd, they won Game 3 in dominant fashion.Backed by Lowry\\u2019s sharp-shooting on Monday, the Raptors raced out to an 18-point first half lead. But the Cavaliers, who\\u2019d made just three of their 22 three-point shots in the first half, started hitting from long distance. And when Irving drained two in a row, he pointed at Drake \\u2013 the Toronto rapper and Cavs heckler \\u2013 as he ran back upcourt.The Raptors led 78-69 to start the fourth, but when Channing Frye drained three straight threes, and James scored on a driving layup with 8:20 left, the Cavaliers took their first lead of the game.\\u201cAt the beginning of the fourth quarter, we lost our composure,\\u201d Casey said. \\u201cWhen we put the starters back in, they regained their foothold.

The Raptors were up by four with a minute to play and their defence came up huge, with a couple of key rebounds and a Biyombo block.Lowry drove to the hoop for a basket with 23 seconds left, to the ear-splitting roar of the Air Canada Centre crowd, and was fouled on the play.

According to Elias Sports Bureau, the last time a team led by at least 15 at halftime in a conference finals without a free throw attempt was Milwaukee in 2001 versus Philadelphia.When the Cavs were whistled for their first foul, the crowd gave the referees a sarcastic standing ovation.The ACC crowd, all in white, was in full voice from the opening tipoff, and included NFL legend Terrell Owens and Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy, Edmonton Eskimos quarterback Mike Reilly, Toronto FC star striker Sebastian Giovinco and actor Stephen Amell, star of the superhero TV drama Arrow.The Raptors raced out to another strong start, shooting 52 per cent in the first quarter, and holding the Cavs to 21 per cent from three-point range.

       " u'Late season additions paying off for Red Deer RebelsRED DEER, Alta. \\u2013 The Red Deer Rebels sold off parts of the future in an attempt to win the 2016 Memorial Cup as the host team. It paid off on Sunday.Adam Helewka scored twice and Jake DeBrusk added a goal and two assists as the host Rebels beat the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies 5-2.Helewka, 20, and 19-year-old DeBrusk were added near the WHL trade deadline along with Luke Philp, also 19. The trio of veterans cost Red Deer six roster players and six draft picks over the next two years, including a first-rounder in 2017.\\u201cWe know why we were brought here and this was a moment we had to be different makers,\\u201d said Helewka, who scored 26 goals in 34 games for the Rebels after being acquired from the Spokane Chiefs.Philp had a single assist, but also won 21-of-31 faceoffs.The victory keeps Red Deer\\u2019s tournament hopes very much alive after losing its opener to the OHL champion London Knights. Another loss would have left the Rebels in a do-or-die situation in their final round-robin game of the tournament against the WHL champion Brandon Wheat Kings.Evan Polei and Haydn Fleury also scored for the Rebels (1-1), while Rylan Toth made 22 saves.Timo Meier and Julien Nantel struck for the Huskies (1-1), who got a 33-save outing from Chase Marchand.Red Deer\\u2019s Nelson Nogier, a 2014 Winnipeg Jets draft pick, took a cross-checking penalty 3:26 into the first period that led to the game\\u2019s opening goal. Meier was able to beat Toth from just inside the right face-off circle for his third goal of the tournament 51 seconds into the power play.It didn\\u2019t take very long for the Huskies to double their lead as Nantel broke into the zone down the left side and snapped the puck through Toth\\u2019s legs at the eight-minute mark.Rebels coach Brent Sutter called a timeout right after the goal to try and reset, and it seemed to spark his team.\\u201cBrent made a couple comments that really made us change our game,\\u201d said Helewka, a 2015 San Jose Sharks draft pick. \\u201cHe told us to just simplify. We know (the Huskies) are a fast team so we tried to play in their zone and limit the turnovers, and that\\u2019s what we did.\\u201dPolei got one back for the Rebels at 11:07 with a clean wrist shot between Marchand\\u2019s pads to make it 2-1, bringing the sold-out crowd of 7,000 at Enmax Centrium to their feet for the first time since opening faceoff.Red Deer outshot the No. 1 ranked team in the country 7-0 to end the first and kept up the pressure early in the second, tying the game just 40 seconds into the period. DeBrusk made a pretty feed out front of the net to Helewka, who beat Marchand blocker side.Four minutes later, while on the power play, Ivan Nikolishin put a point shot on net that DeBrusk tipped past Marchand for a 3-2 lead.\\u201cAs soon as we got the lead the crowd went nuts and we just kept saying score more, score more,\\u201d said DeBrusk, who was selected in the first round of the 2015 draft by the Boston Bruins.A goaltender interference penalty called on Rouyn-Noranda\\u2019s Anthony-John Greer led to Red Deer going up 4-2 with 11:09 to play in the second. DeBrusk, once again, found Helewka for his second of the game and third of the tournament.At that point the Rebels were in full control and had a 19-4 shot advantage since finding their legs on Polei\\u2019s opening marker.Greer picked up two and 10 for unsportsmanlike conduct midway through the third after arguing with the officials about an embellishment call. It left him unable to finish the game.\\u201cI overreacted, I saw it a different way than the refs did (but) I learn from my mistakes,\\u201d said the Colorado Avalanche prospect.Fleury added a late power-play goal to help earn Red Deer its first win at the tournament.Notes: Only one host team in the past eight tournaments has gone on to win the Memorial Cup, the 2012 Shawinigan Cataractes\\u2026 The London Knights (1-0) will play the Brandon Wheat Kings (0-1) on Monday.']"
