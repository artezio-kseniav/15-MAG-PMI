       "   'text': u'The decision to move a valuable photography collection from Bradford\\u2019s National Media Museum to London was \\u201cthe right professional thing to do\\u201d, the director of the museum has insisted during a grilling by a committee of the city\\u2019s councillors. Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally. Budget restraints had encouraged the museum to refine its focus to the science of photography and film rather than art photography, she said, and the collection would therefore be better looked after at the V&A. The museum\\u2019s director, who was head of exhibitions at the science museum in London before moving to head up the Bradford museum in 2012, said that a focus on science would leave the institution better able to attract the funding it needed. The Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection, dating from 1827 to 2016, has been based in the museum since 2003. Among the items moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. \\u201cSome of [the National Media Museum\\u2019s] collections without a doubt support our new vision,\\u201d said Quinton-Tulloch. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s a body of material, and the RPS collection falls absolutely in this, which is more art photography and that is not an area that we are going to curate anymore, and we don\\u2019t have the resource to make it actively available.\\u201d \\u201cWe could leave it within the stores in Bradford, but that would not be the right professional thing to do as a national institution,\\u201d she said, adding that the museum had failed to communicate its plans effectively to MPs, the local council and the public at large. Confidential documents released to the Guardian showed that only Tate Modern in London and the V&A were given the opportunity to bid for Bradford\\u2019s RPS collection and members of the public attending the meeting on Tuesday complained that the decision had been made by a \\u201csouthern elite\\u201d who made no effort to keep the collection in the north of England.\\nThe Royal Photographic Society revealed earlier this month that it was not consulted about the decision to move its collection, saying in a statement that it would prefer that the collection remained in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography. Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London. According to information gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales, Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid \\xa38 for adults and \\xa35 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.',\n",

The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally. Budget restraints had encouraged the museum to refine its focus to the science of photography and film rather than art photography, she said, and the collection would therefore be better looked after at the V&A. The museum\\u2019s director, who was head of exhibitions at the science museum in London before moving to head up the Bradford museum in 2012, said that a focus on science would leave the institution better able to attract the funding it needed. The Royal Photographic Society (RPS) collection, dating from 1827 to 2016, has been based in the museum since 2003. Among the items moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. \\u201cSome of [the National Media Museum\\u2019s] collections without a doubt support our new vision,\\u201d said Quinton-Tulloch. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s a body of material, and the RPS collection falls absolutely in this, which is more art photography and that is not an area that we are going to curate anymore, and we don\\u2019t have the resource to make it actively available.\\u201d \\u201cWe could leave it within the stores in Bradford, but that would not be the right professional thing to do as a national institution,\\u201d she said, adding that the museum had failed to communicate its plans effectively to MPs, the local council and the public at large. Confidential documents released to the Guardian showed that only Tate Modern in London and the V&A were given the opportunity to bid for Bradford\\u2019s RPS collection and members of the public attending the meeting on Tuesday complained that the decision had been made by a \\u201csouthern elite\\u201d who made no effort to keep the collection in the north of England.\\nThe Royal Photographic Society revealed earlier this month that it was not consulted about the decision to move its collection, saying in a statement that it would prefer that the collection remained in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography. Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London. According to information gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales, Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid \\xa38 for adults and \\xa35 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.',\n",

Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London.

Among the items moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. \\u201cSome of [the National Media Museum\\u2019s] collections without a doubt support our new vision,\\u201d said Quinton-Tulloch. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s a body of material, and the RPS collection falls absolutely in this, which is more art photography and that is not an area that we are going to curate anymore, and we don\\u2019t have the resource to make it actively available.\\u201d \\u201cWe could leave it within the stores in Bradford, but that would not be the right professional thing to do as a national institution,\\u201d she said, adding that the museum had failed to communicate its plans effectively to MPs, the local council and the public at large. Confidential documents released to the Guardian showed that only Tate Modern in London and the V&A were given the opportunity to bid for Bradford\\u2019s RPS collection and members of the public attending the meeting on Tuesday complained that the decision had been made by a \\u201csouthern elite\\u201d who made no effort to keep the collection in the north of England.\\nThe Royal Photographic Society revealed earlier this month that it was not consulted about the decision to move its collection, saying in a statement that it would prefer that the collection remained in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography. Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London. According to information gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales, Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid \\xa38 for adults and \\xa35 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.',\n",

Among the items moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. \\u201cSome of [the National Media Museum\\u2019s] collections without a doubt support our new vision,\\u201d said Quinton-Tulloch. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s a body of material, and the RPS collection falls absolutely in this, which is more art photography and that is not an area that we are going to curate anymore, and we don\\u2019t have the resource to make it actively available.\\u201d \\u201cWe could leave it within the stores in Bradford, but that would not be the right professional thing to do as a national institution,\\u201d she said, adding that the museum had failed to communicate its plans effectively to MPs, the local council and the public at large. Confidential documents released to the Guardian showed that only Tate Modern in London and the V&A were given the opportunity to bid for Bradford\\u2019s RPS collection and members of the public attending the meeting on Tuesday complained that the decision had been made by a \\u201csouthern elite\\u201d who made no effort to keep the collection in the north of England.\\nThe Royal Photographic Society revealed earlier this month that it was not consulted about the decision to move its collection, saying in a statement that it would prefer that the collection remained in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography. Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London. According to information gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales, Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid \\xa38 for adults and \\xa35 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.',\n",

Among the items moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. \\u201cSome of [the National Media Museum\\u2019s] collections without a doubt support our new vision,\\u201d said Quinton-Tulloch. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s a body of material, and the RPS collection falls absolutely in this, which is more art photography and that is not an area that we are going to curate anymore, and we don\\u2019t have the resource to make it actively available.\\u201d \\u201cWe could leave it within the stores in Bradford, but that would not be the right professional thing to do as a national institution,\\u201d she said, adding that the museum had failed to communicate its plans effectively to MPs, the local council and the public at large. Confidential documents released to the Guardian showed that only Tate Modern in London and the V&A were given the opportunity to bid for Bradford\\u2019s RPS collection and members of the public attending the meeting on Tuesday complained that the decision had been made by a \\u201csouthern elite\\u201d who made no effort to keep the collection in the north of England.\\nThe Royal Photographic Society revealed earlier this month that it was not consulted about the decision to move its collection, saying in a statement that it would prefer that the collection remained in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography. Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London. According to information gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales, Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid \\xa38 for adults and \\xa35 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.',\n",

Among the items moving to the V&A are works by the British photography pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented the negative/positive process for producing photographs, and Julia Margaret Cameron, known for her pre-Raphaelite-inspired portrait photography. \\u201cSome of [the National Media Museum\\u2019s] collections without a doubt support our new vision,\\u201d said Quinton-Tulloch. \\u201cBut there\\u2019s a body of material, and the RPS collection falls absolutely in this, which is more art photography and that is not an area that we are going to curate anymore, and we don\\u2019t have the resource to make it actively available.\\u201d \\u201cWe could leave it within the stores in Bradford, but that would not be the right professional thing to do as a national institution,\\u201d she said, adding that the museum had failed to communicate its plans effectively to MPs, the local council and the public at large. Confidential documents released to the Guardian showed that only Tate Modern in London and the V&A were given the opportunity to bid for Bradford\\u2019s RPS collection and members of the public attending the meeting on Tuesday complained that the decision had been made by a \\u201csouthern elite\\u201d who made no effort to keep the collection in the north of England.\\nThe Royal Photographic Society revealed earlier this month that it was not consulted about the decision to move its collection, saying in a statement that it would prefer that the collection remained in Bradford provided the museum remained a well-staffed centre for photography. Despite claims that the RPS photography collection would be more accessible to the public in London, a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian revealed that an exhibition of more than 200 photographs from the collection had 8,000 more visitors in Bradford than it did in London. According to information gathered by door counters, exit surveys and ticket sales, Drawn by Light was seen by 29,000 people when on display in the north for free, while 21,260 paid \\xa38 for adults and \\xa35 for children to see the show in the Science Museum in London.',\n",

The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally.

The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally.

Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally.

       "   'text': u'The decision to move a valuable photography collection from Bradford\\u2019s National Media Museum to London was \\u201cthe right professional thing to do\\u201d, the director of the museum has insisted during a grilling by a committee of the city\\u2019s councillors. Appearing in front of a Bradford Council scrutiny committee meeting organised to examine plans to relocate around 400,000 objects from the Bradford museum to a new \\u201cinternational photography resource centre\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert museum in Kensington, Jo Quinton-Tulloch said the museum had been forced to make practical decisions in response to a 30% cut to its government funding. The plans to move the collection were announced in February and prompted accusations of \\u201ccultural vandalism\\u201d from local politicians and a petition to keep the collection in the West Yorkshire city has been signed by over 27,000 people. The artist David Hockney, film director Mike Leigh and photographer Don McCullin were among more than 80 leading cultural figures calling for the reversal of the decision.\\nQuinton-Tulloch said the decision was not about London or Bradford, but was about making the collection more accessible to people generally. Budget restraints had encouraged the museum to refine its focus to the science of photography and film rather than art photography, she said, and the collection would therefore be better looked after at the V&A. The museum\\u2019s director, who was head of exhibitions at the science museum in London before moving to head up the Bradford museum in 2012, said that a focus on science would leave the institution better able to attract the funding it needed.

Gvasalia\\u2019s reaction was applauded \\u2013 mostly by Tran, a self-described \\u201cdumb kid\\u201d probably bracing himself for a lawsuit while hiding under the covers in his bedroom at his parents\\u2019 house. But also by the wider fashion community. After all, it would be a tough sell for Gvasalia to argue against Vetememes since Vetements is itself a master of logo play.

A generation that sees pop art as classic will immediately get the out-of-context irony of wearing something so everyday as the logo of a delivery brand on the catwalk, and charging \\xa3185 for it.

Gvasalia\\u2019s reaction was applauded \\u2013 mostly by Tran, a self-described \\u201cdumb kid\\u201d probably bracing himself for a lawsuit while hiding under the covers in his bedroom at his parents\\u2019 house. But also by the wider fashion community. After all, it would be a tough sell for Gvasalia to argue against Vetememes since Vetements is itself a master of logo play.

A generation that sees pop art as classic will immediately get the out-of-context irony of wearing something so everyday as the logo of a delivery brand on the catwalk, and charging \\xa3185 for it.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914.

He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration.

There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought. Although 43% of those interviewed were not sure that the Somme was part of the first world war, schoolchildren did better than their parents \\u2013 in many cases the grandchildren of those who fought. Many of those who did know the date and location of the Somme believed the combat was confined to Europe, and knew nothing of the fighting in Africa, Russia, China, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East. The museum is currently closed for a major rebuild and not due to open until next year, but is releasing an online archive of downloadable facts and images about the Somme, including diaries and letters from soldiers, and encouraging schools and other institutions to create their own exhibitions.',\n",

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration.

       "   'text': u'The centenary of the Battle of the Somme will be marked by international ceremonies at the Thiepval Memorial in France on 1 July, attended by politicians, descendants of those who fought, and 600 schoolchildren from Britain, Ireland and France. The infamous first world war battle, one of the bloodiest in the history of warfare, lasted 141 days, and more than a million people were killed or wounded. The Thiepval Memorial, the largest in the world and designed, like the Cenotaph in London, by Sir Edwin Lutyens, carries the names of 72,000 people killed but buried in unmarked graves. The centenary services are being hosted by the French and British governments, and while the main event is on 1 July, there will be smaller ceremonies marking each day of the battle. Music will play a major role in the ceremony, with performers including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Band of the Royal Irish Regiment, the British tenor Samuel Boden, the band of the Welsh Guards, and the Ch\\u0153ur de l\\u2019Arm\\xe9e Fran\\xe7aise. The army bands will perform songs connected to the battle, including some written by soldiers in the trenches. The music from the BBC Symphony Orchestra will include George Butterworth\\u2019s The Banks of Green Willow, which was composed while he served with the Durham Light Infantry. He was awarded the Military Cross but did not live to receive it, and his name is among those on the Thiepval Memorial. The orchestra includes several musicians whose ancestors fought at the Somme, including the horn player Andrew Antcliff, whose grandfather Herbert Marriott was 27 when he joined the Sherwood Foresters in 1914. Like so many who survived, he scarcely spoke of his experiences, but the family believed that he never really recovered from being gassed \\u2013 although he did go on to father 11 children. He was injured in the battle, and discharged as unfit in 1917. He died in 1946 of a strangulated hernia, having refused to go to hospital because his memories of the field hospitals were still so vivid. \\u201cIt is going to be a strange experience,\\u201d Antcliff said. \\u201cMy children have visited the battlefields and cemeteries, but I never did. I\\u2019m not sure how I will feel \\u2013 I hope I\\u2019m not overcome with too much emotion, I\\u2019ve been known to have a little moment while playing \\u2013 but there is something very moving about joining this commemoration. We have to remember what happened at the Somme, to stop it from ever happening again, or else it really was all for nothing.\\u201d Although no veterans of the battle are alive, some original vehicles will be there, including a London bus, now part of the London Transport Museum collection, which was commandeered and converted into an ambulance in 1916. There will also be a flypast of replica period aircraft, from the Yorkshire Air Museum and the First World War Aviation Heritage Trust. Although the main events will be at Thiepval, there will be many events in Britain, including vigils at Westminster Abbey, in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Northern Ireland on 30 June, and a service in Manchester Cathedral on 1 July. Research by the National Army Museum has revealed that despite the fame of the battle, many Britons have only a hazy idea about where or when it was fought.
