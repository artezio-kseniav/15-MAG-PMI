      "But in New Mexico, you have to earn a mere $231,300 to get into the elite ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nationally, a family needs an income of just under $390,000. However, just what it means to be in the Top 1% varies considerably by state, according to a new report by the Economic Policy Institute, which used Internal Revenue Service data to calculate the threshold for households in each state. The figures are for 2013.\n",

      "\n",
      "In January 2016 -- two years after four-year-old Joel passed away -- 'That Dragon, Cancer' was released.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two-hour game is less choose-your-own adventure and more about immersive experience -- putting the player right in the center of the Green family's battle for Joel's life. You see the diagnosis, the tears, the desperate prayers -- but you also hear Joel's laughter, lots of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green said that people have embraced it, despite the fact that it's not the type of game you'd sit down to play over and over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was incredible, the groundswell of interest,\" said Green, onstage at the Wired Business Conference in New York City on Thursday. \"We were able to share our story and that gave other people permission to share theirs. That grief process -- that's all I could hope for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Magic Leap and Lucasfilm launch lab in SF\n",
      "\n",
      "Green said the game was a team effort. There were four full-time people working on it, and his wife Amy wrote the script.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green used the metaphor of a boat to describe players' engagement with the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you're in a boat, you're going where it's going. You can be freaked out and flail and try to drive it limited way,\" he said. \"[But] we invite you in as a friend. You go downstream with us. It's about the discovery of the story ... It's about grace in the midst of having no choice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The game, which costs $14.99, was a memorial to Joel -- but has also made him live on through the experiences of stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green said people write him and say, \"'The thing that I loved most was making Joel laugh.' They wanted to comfort him as if he was present. I hope it adds to their life experience -- to have loved Joel.\"\n",

      "But Green doesn't return to the game himself.\n",

      "\"That work is done,\" he said. \"It's been all consuming: losing Joel, grieving Joel -- it needs to be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As for what's next? Green -- who has four children -- said his next project will be in the virtual reality space, although he won't disclose details. His studio, Numinous Games, also plans to bring 'That Dragon, Cancer' to mobile devices, in order to share Joel's story with even more people. Right now, it's just available on Macs and PCs.\n",

      "Many Rolls-Royce owners don't drive the car themselves. They hire someone to do that. In the next century they won't even have to bother paying someone to drive their Rolls. The car will take care of the driving on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, in the distant future, Rolls-Royce buyers won't have to bother with selecting from a limited model range and just choosing paint colors and interior options. Instead, every Rolls-Royce buyer will be able to create a completely unique car suited to his or her own tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least that's what Rolls-Royce's parent company, BMW (BAMXY), expects. As part BMW's 100th birthday celebration, the German luxury automaker has been unveiling a series of futuristic concept cars it calls its \"Vision Next 100 Cars\" cars. Two of those cars, a Rolls-Royce and a Mini, were unveiled in London Thursday. BMW owns both of the British car brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rolls-Royce Vision Next 100 lacks any driving controls whatsoever since the car will always drive itself. It would be propelled by a \"zero-emissions powertrain,\" although a Rolls-Royce spokesman did not specify what that would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concept car is intended to represent just one among limitless possibilities the future individual of ample means could choose. Thanks to what are expected to be extraordinarily flexible manufacturing technologies in the future, Rolls-Royce designers of the future will be able to work with clients to create virtually any shape, size or style of car imaginable. Buyers will no longer have to have to choose a Phantom, Wraith or Dawn. The can create their own Rolls-Royce and call it, one presumes, anything they wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of the Vision Next 100, making an entrance was apparently very important to this imaginary future customer. Along with the doors, the roof also opens, allowing occupants to simply stand right up and walk out of the car. None of that awkward bending over to get out. Light projections create a virtual red carpet on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the car, occupants are assisted by Eleanor, a computer-generated virtual assistant who appears in a transparent display. She's a lifelike embodiment of the famous Spirit of Ecstasy statuette that rides atop the grill of every Rolls-Royce and which was modeled after the Edwardian-era actress and model Eleanor Thornton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passengers can ask Eleanor to take them somewhere or to find a good restaurant along the way. Over time, Eleanor can learn the tastes and preferences of regular passengers and predict their desires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passengers will sit on silk upholstery in a cabin outfitted with rare Macassar ebony trim and hand-twisted silk carpeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Rolls-Royce's first true concept car, Rolls-Royce spokesman Andrew Ball said. The British luxury automaker has created \"experimental\" cars before, but this is the first time designers have created something as purely fanciful as this.\n",

      "The Cleveland Cavaliers forced a deciding Game 7 of the NBA Finals, which will begin after 8 p.m. ET.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deciding game is likely to be in the second quarter at 9 p.m. when HBO's Emmy-winning drama, will feature a battle for the fictional kingdom of Winterfell, a widely anticipated showdown that has been teased throughout the season. (The episode is subtitled \"Battle of the Bastards,\" referring to the central combatants, Jon Snow and Ramsay Bolton.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, many of those inclined to watch both can record one during the period in which they overlap. Yet that also raises the risk of having what happens spoiled via social media given the passions of the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: NBA Finals has most watched Game 1 since 1998\n",
      "\n",
      "Few programs can rival the must-watch ardor of \"Game of Thrones.\" The show is such a reliable driver of web traffic that news outlets hang on every wrinkle -- posting stories immediately after it airs, and even analyzing weekly teases for the next episode, synopses and newly issued publicity photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audience profile for the HBO drama overlaps with that of sports more than most popular series. According to Nielsen data, 57% of the audience is male, and 43% female. (Like CNN, HBO is a unit of Time Warner (TWX).)\n",
      "\n",
      "By going to a Game 7, the Finals are already a huge boon to Disney (DIS)-owned ABC/ESPN, since ratings generally peak for such games, and give the network the maximum amount of commercial inventory to sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Golden State Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games last year. That series averaged nearly 20 million viewers, the highest for the Finals since 1998.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Chinese resort is a big bet by Disney CEO Bob Iger on a massive market that he admits can be a tricky place to operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the grand opening comes at a time when Disney is also having to respond to emergencies back in the U.S., including the alligator attack at Walt Disney World in Florida that left a 2-year-old boy dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iger issued a statement expressing his sympathies to the boy's family over their \"devastating loss.\" Hours later, however, the focus was on the dedication ceremony of the Shanghai resort.\n",
      "\n",
      "With senior Chinese officials in attendance, the Disney chief called the opening \"one of the proudest and most exciting moments\" in the company's history.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wet grand opening: #Shanghai #Disneyland ready for its first guests in the rain. pic.twitter.com/2lmT0a79yU — Steven Jiang (@StevenCNN) June 16, 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "After the ceremony, thousands of visitors flocked to check out Shanghai DisneyLand's attractions. Here are the key numbers to know about the brand new park:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost: $5.5 billion. The resort is the biggest investment the company has ever made outside the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years in the making: Construction began more than five years ago in April 2011. But the idea goes back much further: Disney has been talking about building a Shanghai theme park since the mid 2000s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Disney CEO says China is tough but a 'great opportunity'\n",
      "\n",
      "Size: The park is 963 acres, bigger than New York City's Central Park. Shanghai dwarfs the company's other Asian parks in Hong Kong and Tokyo. And Disney says it's already started construction to extend attractions beyond the existing Shanghai site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shanghai also features the largest castle and longest parade route of any Disney park in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attractions: Two hotels, a shopping district and six themed lands -- Mickey Avenue, Gardens of Imagination, Fantasyland, Adventure Isle, Treasure Cove and Tomorrowland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees: Around 10,000 on the opening day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected visitors: The House of Mouse isn't saying how many people it expects to visit Shanghai Disney per year. But analysts at Nomura Securities are predicting 15 million. And interest in the site has already been high. Since Disney began a kind of soft launch of the theme park in early May, more than 600,000 people have visited it, the company said Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Target audience: The company estimates that 330 million people live within a three-hour drive or train ride of Shanghai, which is situated China's incredibly densely populated eastern seaboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ownership: Disney isn't going it alone on this project. Like many Western companies operating in China, it had to team up with a local partner to keep authorities happy. Disney owns 43% of the resort company. Its Chinese partner, state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group, holds the other 57%. But Disney has the majority stake in the resort's management company.\n",
