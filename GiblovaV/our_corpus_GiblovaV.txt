They scraped home against the Suns to keep their finals hope flickering but coach Damien Hardwick concedes the team is a long way off its best.

The electronics giant is mulling two new smartphones for 2017 that have bendable screens, one of which will fold \u201clike a cosmetic compact,\u201d Bloomberg said, citing sources \u201cfamiliar\u201d with the development.', u'Another device will have a 5-inch display when used as a handset but will unfold into a display \u201cthat\u2019s as large as 8 inches,\u201d according to the report.', 'Related: Computex 2016 highlights: Home robot, razor-thin MacBook clone, and a gorgeous 3D printer', 'Samsung has broached the possibility in the past.

It\u2019s just menacing waves beating against the sand bordering houses.', 'Coastal engineer Angus Gordon, who is advising the local council in assessing homes and working on recovery of the row of vulnerable houses, has seen the worst of the damage.', 'He has inspected affected properties, but says some were too dangerous to enter.', u'\u201cThe worst one I haven\u2019t been inside, but went down the side of the house and had a good look into it,\u201d he said.', u'\u201cThe lounge room had started to slump and the internal furniture was all at strange angles and up against the wall.', u'\u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared to go into the building itself because the front part of it was not stable, it\u2019s too unsafe.\u201d', u'Most residents were given only an hour\u2019s notice to retrieve valued belongings from their homes, and while most have been allowed back in to gather more, Mr Gordon said most houses were filled with now damaged items, adding to the residents\u2019 personal damage bills.', u'With the storm just about passed and tides retreating, talk has turned to recovery, but Mr Gordon says it\u2019s far too early to begin even thinking about getting to work on the houses.', u'\u201cThere\u2019s still another high tide to come and the waves are still up,\u201d he said.', u'\u201cIt\u2019s monitoring the situation, the State Government has now appointed a recovery office person, but there\u2019s a lot of planning and a lot of work that needs to happen.\u201d', 'Mr Gordon has said before homes in the affected area were safe to be inhabited a sea wall must be built on the coastline.', 'Council and residents finally seem to have accepted this, with the Northern Beaches Council admitting the structure is needed, and confirming it will work with the State Government and residents to build a sea wall on Collaroy Beach.', u'Homeowners are expected to be billed $140,000 each to cover the cost of the wall. They\u2019ve agreed to do it, but it\u2019s going to be a lengthy project.', u'\u201cThere\u2019s got to be the money, there\u2019s got to be a firm agreement with all parties, and there\u2019s got to be a sea wall designed and built,\u201d Mr Gordon said.', u'\u201cThere\u2019s so many variables in this. There\u2019s a lot of rock needed, you\u2019ve got to be able to source that rock, and that\u2019s a heck of a lot of rock. You\u2019re talking about a pretty big production rate for the quarries, and then you need the trucks to transport it and the logistics start to control it.\u201d', u'Only after the sea wall has been completed could work begin on the homes, Mr Gordon said, and that\u2019s if they remain standing.', 'NSW Planning Minister Rob Stokes said there was a recent plan to build a sea wall in Collaroy where the damage occurred, but the owners would not agree on making a contribution.', u'\u201c(It) required the owners to make a contribution,\u201d Mr Stokes told the ', '.', u'\u201cThe owners couldn\u2019t agree on whether they would contribute.

finance : [['Deutsche Bank has been hit by a spate of suicides, but questions have been raised about foul play.', 'Three bankers in New York, London and Siena, Italy, died within 17 months of each other in 2013/14 in what authorities deemed a series of unrelated suicides.', 'But in each case, the victim had a connection to a burgeoning global banking scandal, leaving more questions than answers as to the circumstances surrounding their deaths.', u'The March 6, 2013, death of David Rossi \u2014 a 51-year-old communications director at Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world\u2019s oldest bank \u2014 came as the institution teetered on the brink of collapse.', u'Rossi was found dead in an alleyway beneath his third-floor office window in the 14th-century palazzo that served as the bank\u2019s headquarters.', u'A devastating security video shows Rossi landing on the pavement on his back, facing the building \u2014 an odd position more likely to occur when a body is pushed from a window.', u'The footage shows that the three-storey fall didn\u2019t kill Rossi instantly. For almost 20 minutes, the banker lay on the dimly lit cobblestone, occasionally moving an arm and leg.', u'As he lay dying, two murky figures appear. Two men appear and one walks over to gaze at the banker. He offers no aid or comfort and doesn\u2019t call for help before turning around and calmly walking out of the alley.', u'About an hour later, a co-worker discovered Rossi\u2019s body. The arms were bruised and he sustained a head wound that, according to the local medical examiner\u2019s report, suggested there may have been a struggle prior to his fall.', u'But the death was ruled a suicide to the disbelief of Rossi\u2019s widow, Antonella Tognazzi. She was quoted in the Italian press as saying her husband \u201cknew too much.\u201d She staged public demonstrations and hired a lawyer to investigate her husband\u2019s death.', 'Among the evidence Tognazzi pointed to was the alleged suicide note, in which Rossi referred to her as Toni. He never called her Toni, she said.', u'Two days prior to his death, according to his wife, Rossi sent a cryptic email to the bank\u2019s chief executive Fabrizio Viola.', u'\u201cI want guarantees of not being overwhelmed by this thing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe would have to do right away, before tomorrow. Can you help me?\u201d', u'It remains a mystery what specifically Rossi thought could \u201coverwhelm\u201d him just before his death, but many have speculated that he was referring to Monte Paschi\u2019s troubled financial position.', u'Rossi was a close confidant to former bank president Joseph Mussari, who was the driving force behind Monte Paschi\u2019s 2008 $US7.5 billion takeover of Banca Antonveneta.', 'Many banking analysts agreed at the time that Monte Paschi paid too much in the acquisition that Deutsche Bank financed.', u'The same year as Rossi\u2019s death, European and US regulators began to probe what would become known as the Libor scandal, in which London bankers conspired to rig the London Interbank Offered Rate \u2014 an overnight interest rate that determines the interest banks charged on mortgages, and auto and personal loans across the globe.', 'It also determines the rate banks like Monte Paschi pay for loans like the one it used to finance the purchase of Banca Antonveneta.', u'The scandal would cost international banks \u2014 most notably Deutsche \u2014 nearly $20 billion in fines.', 'Monte Paschi also got involved in risky derivatives that took heavy losses during the financial crisis of 2008.', u'The esteemed bank, founded 20 years before Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic, was being investigated at the time of Rossi\u2019s death for its handling of billions in these risky derivative bets involving Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch.', u'In October 2014 Mussari and two other Monte Paschi executives were convicted by Italian authorities of obstructing regulators and misleading investigators on the bailed-out Italian bank\u2019s finances in the wake of the acquisition of Banca Antonveneta.', u'In January of this year, three executive from Deustche Bank were also implicated civilly, including Michele Faissola, the wealth management director the German bank \u2014 charged by Italian authorities of colluding with the troubled Monte Paschi in falsifying accounts, manipulating the market, and obstructing justice. Faissola denies these charges.', u'While at least 40 bankers have killed themselves in the 17-month period starting March 2013 in the wake of the global banking scandal, the circumstances of Rossi\u2019s death \u2014 and two others \u2014 stand out as particularly mysterious.', 'In January 2014, the body of William Broeksmit, 58, a high-ranking Deutsche Bank executive, was found hanging in his London flat from a dog leash tied to the top of a door.', u'Financial papers were strewn about, and on a dog bed near the body were a number of notes to family and friends. One was addressed to Deutsche Bank chief executive Anshu Jain, with an apology. But that note \u2014 never publicly revealed until now \u2014 offered no clue as to the reason he was sorry.', u'Broeksmit\u2019s high-ranking colleague at Deutche was Michele Faissola, who arrived on the gruesome scene after Broeksmit\u2019s wife told his stepson, Val Broeksmit, to phone him.

He mobilised millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with politics-as-usual, even among Democrats who have controlled the White House since 2009.', 'Clinton, the former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady, reached the 2383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee on Monday with a decisive weekend victory in Puerto Rico and a burst of last-minute support from superdelegates.', 'Those are party officials and officeholders, many of them eager to wrap up the primary amid preference polls showing her in a tightening race with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.', 'Clinton has 1812 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses.

Following the results in Puerto Rico, it is no longer possible for Sanders to reach the 2383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates.', u'Sanders said this past weekend he plans to fight on until the convention, promising to make the case to superdelegates that he is better positioned to beat Trump in November. Superdelegates can change their minds. But since the start of the AP\u2019s survey in late 2015, no superdelegates have switched from supporting Clinton to backing Sanders.', u'Indeed, Clinton\u2019s victory is broadly decisive. She leads Sanders by more than three million cast votes, by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates.

His liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove Clinton to the left on issues such as trade, Wall Street and campaign finance reform.', 'But she prevailed, in part, by claiming much of the coalition that boosted Obama. She won overwhelming support from women and minorities, catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse, delegate-rich states such as New York and Texas.', u'When Clinton launched her campaign last April, she did so largely unopposed, having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the party\u2019s organisational and fundraising infrastructure. Vice President Joe Biden, seen as her most threatening rival, opted not to run in October.', 'Of the four opponents who did take her on, Sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge. He caught fire among young voters and independents, his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in Iowa in February and a commanding victory in New Hampshire. His ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring.', u'But Clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates, hiring help from Obama\u2019s old team before launching her campaign. They pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could win the most pledged delegates.', 'Her victory in Nevada in late February diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation. Decisive wins in Southern states on Super Tuesday and a sweep of March 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead, which became insurmountable by the end of April after big victories in New York and in the Northeast.', u'She now moves on to face Trump, whose ascent to the top of the Republican Party few expected. The brash real estate mogul and reality TV star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to Clinton, debuting a nickname \u2014 \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d \u2014 and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup.', 'After a long primary campaign, Clinton said this past weekend in California she was ready to accept his challenge.', u'\u201cWe\u2019re judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, not our ethnicity, not our religion,\u201d she said Saturday in Oxnard, California. \u201cSo it is time to judge Donald Trump by his words and his deeds.
