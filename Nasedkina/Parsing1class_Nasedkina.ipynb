The chief has also committed to posting more officers near the Village and areas where events will be happening, Pride\\'s executive director Mathieu\\xa0Chantelois said.Toronto police have not made any other decisions about changes to Pride events in the city, Const. Jenifferjit Sidhu said Sunday. Sidhu said the force\\'s LGBT liaison officer has reached out to counterparts in Florida and to Pride Toronto to assess any threats.The celebratory nature of Pride has been already been shadowed by the shooting, with a candlelight vigil planned on Church Street Sunday night to honour the 50 who died and the 53 injured in the shooting at Pulse nightclub.Chantelois said that he was sickened by both the hatred and the violence in Florida, saying that he had still been unable to eat by late afternoon.\"What happened has already changed what this Pride month is about,\" he said. \"There\\'s not one march, not one rally, not one human rights panel that we will not address it. And on July 3, when a million of us will take the street, it\\'s going to be in everyone\\'s mind.\"\\xa0Pride events have always been about a creating an place for people to feel safe to be themselves.

And for good reason.\"The way the noise echoed here was really cool,\" Henderson said. \"I\\'d never experienced that before. ... And then a lot of those cheers ended up being for me, which was even cooler.\"Henderson won her first major title Sunday, beating top-ranked Lydia Ko with a birdie on the first hole of a playoff to win the KPMG Women\\'s PGA Championship after overcoming a three-shot deficit on the back nine.The 18-year-old Canadian, ranked No. 4 in the world, closed with a bogey-free 6-under 65 \\u2014 the best round of the week at Sahalee Country Club \\u2014 to match Ko at 6-under 278. Ko finished with a 67.In the playoff on the par-4 18th, Henderson hit her second shot \\u2014 a 7-iron from 155 yards \\u2014 to 3 feet, while Ko\\'s second from farther back in the fairway left her with 20 feet. Ko missed to the left, and Henderson tapped in to cap a week that started with a hole-in-one on her fourth hole Thursday and ended with a major championship.Henderson became the second-youngest winner in a major championship, with Ko the youngest last year in the Evian Championship in France. Henderson also is the second Canadian woman to win a major championship, following Sandra Post\\'s victory in the 1968 event, and is projected to jump from fourth to second in the world on Monday. Her first victory came last year in Portland, Oregon.\"To think about all of the incredible players that have\\xa0come before me,\" Henderson said. \"I was ready some of the names on this trophy and it\\'s very, very cool.\"Ko was bidding to become the fifth player in tour history to win three straight majors. Most times a bogey-free round with four birdies would be enough.\"I\\'m happy with the way I played. I just got outplayed,\" the New Zealander said. \"For Brooke to shoot 65 on the final day at a major, at a course like this is very impressive.\"The final round was a display of nearly flawless golf from the best after players spent the first three rounds getting kicked around at difficult Sahalee. Henderson, Ko and third-place Ariya Jutanugarn played a combined 56 holes on the final day without a bogey. Jutanugarn, in search of a fourth straight victory, shot a 66 to finish a stroke back. The 20-year Thai player missed a birdie putt on the 18th that could have put her into the playoff.But no one was better than Henderson, who was the first round leader after a 67 before shooting consecutive rounds of 73. Three times she saved par out of the bunker, although her best save came the first time she played the 18th. Henderson\\'s tee shot found the trees right of the fairway, but she scrambled to make a 12-footer to finish out a back nine of 31.That moment likely decided the tournament. While Henderson saved par on 18, Ko missed a 4-foot birdie try on the par-3 17th after a perfect tee shot.\"I\\'m not really sure if I pushed it,\" Ko said. \"I didn\\'t feel like it was a bad stroke.\"Henderson began the day at even par, two strokes behind Ko. The Canadian pulled off the comeback with a perfect back nine after going out in 2 under. Henderson\\'s 90-foot eagle putt from the front of the green at the 11th was just the third at the long par 5 all week and separated her from a large pack at 2 under.\"We needed to go on a birdie run or something so that sort of jump started us and we were able to keep going,\" said Brittany Henderson, her sister\\'s caddie.Ko answered with a birdie at the 11th, but Henderson drew another huge roar with a birdie at the 13th to stay one shot behind. Both continued to make pars until the 17th when Henderson pulled even by dropping a 35-foot birdie putt after pulling her tee shot to the wrong side of the green on the par 3.But Henderson had one more birdie remaining that will only raise the expectations for the Canadian star.\"Looking forward to the rest of the summer.

He then killed the women, execution-style.By the time he turned the weapon on himself, he\\'d slaughtered 14 young women for the offence of being women, earning himself a place at the apex of misogynistic violence.Lepine\\'s suicide note read, in part:\"I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker \\u2026 The feminists have always enraged me.\"\\xa0The atrocity, and its stated motivation, immediately triggered an angry and overdue conversation in Canada about misogyny and collective male guilt.Men who\\'d never as much as lifted a hand to a woman in their lives were told that even so, if they\\'d ever smiled at a sexist joke or tolerated discrimination against a woman, they\\'d done their bit to shape a culture that culminated with the funerals of those 14 girls in Montreal.It was hard to swallow, but only a dullard could reject the logic outright.And, at least partially as a result, open sexism and misogynistic humour became far less okay after Polytechnique, at least in polite company. It was a transformative moment.Now, after Omar Mateen armed himself, reportedly professed allegiance to ISIS and went hunting gays in an Orlando night club, could there possibly be a better time to have the same conversation about organized religion, and what responsibility it bears for the pain and misery and death inflicted on gays for so many centuries in the name of god?And not just the Muslim god. That is happening now because of Mateen, and deservedly so, but restricting the discussion to Islam is far too easy.Islam may be more overt about its homophobia than the other major religions \\u2014 anyone who\\'s worked in the Middle East has heard some fool in high office declaring that there are no gays in Islam, and therefore no AIDS \\u2014 but the fact is, conservative iterations of all the monotheistic faiths are deeply and actively and systemically anti-gay.The sacred monotheistic texts contain prohibitions that would by just about any legal definition be considered hate speech in the modern secular world.The Old Testament Book of Leviticus 20:13 states: \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\"The Qu\\'ran proscribes sex between Muslim males, and mandates punishment, although it does sometimes allow for leniency. Elsewhere, though, it cites the destruction of Sodom, held as divine punishment for homosexual sex, as a lesson.And the Hadith, the Qu\\'ranic commentaries, contain references to punishing the \"abomination\" of gay sex with stoning or immolation.Such prohibitions could be dismissed as antediluvian anachronisms, not to be taken seriously in the modern world.But of course they are taken quite seriously. Deadly seriously.Fundamentalists and traditionalists of all three faiths not only regard such passages as divine instruction, they actually portray their homophobia as a matter of religious freedom; something noble, protected by constitutions and essential to democracy, when in fact they are working to oppress and deny fundamental rights to people based solely upon the sexuality with which they were born.A perfect example is Proposition 8, the California ballot initiative whose purpose was to block the advance of same-sex marriage, on the grounds that it would somehow harm or invalidate heterosexual marriage, and would result in schoolchildren being taught that gay sex is normal and acceptable.Prop 8 proponents included the Roman Catholic Church, the Knights of Columbus, the California Catholic Conference of bishops, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormons), the Union of Orthodox Jewish Organizations of America and assorted evangelical Christian groups. Together, they poured a fortune into the campaign. The Mormons alone provided $20 million.They won, then immediately lost when the initiative was vacated by secular courts.Since then, organized religions have continued their anti-gay activities, often going to court to ensure their right to discriminate against gays in hospitals and schools and other religiously affiliated institutions.Yes, it is true that Pope Francis has softened his church\\'s line on homosexuality. But his tolerance is only remarkable in contrast to his hardline predecessor, and church doctrine remains unchanged.It is also true that the Reform and to an extent the Conservative streams of Judaism have moderated their tone where gays are concerned.Not so Islam. That religion remains largely hostile to gays, and anti-gay sentiment is woven into the laws of many Muslim countries.Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar, a British-born physician and imam, has spoken at public venues in the United States, softly and diffidently asserting that as a matter of compassion, homosexuals should be put to death.There are many, many other sheikhs like Farrokh Sekaleshfar.And while evangelical Christians don\\'t seek the death penalty for homosexuality, many do want it punished. In 2004, Dr. Richard Land, the Oxford-educated former president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, told me on camera he thought gay sex should be outlawed.\\xa0In any event, this much is singularly true: the worst mass murder in American history was directed at one group, and it was done by some one who had sworn allegiance to a fundamentalist religious group.If casual misogyny and sexist humour helped create Marc L\\xe9pine, then organized religion must reflect on helping shape a culture that will this week have led to 50 funerals in Florida. It\\'s not just the extremists who want to deprive gays of human rights.People of faith might ask themselves this: even if they\\'ve never so much as lifted a hand to a gay person, have they smiled at a homophobic joke? Or overlooked mistreatment? Or nodded during a anti-gay sermon?And if so, wouldn\\'t this be a good time to speak up?', u'In December 1989, Marc L\\xe9pine armed himself with a Ruger Mini-14 semiautomatic rifle and headed off to Montreal\\'s \\xc9cole Polytechnique, hunting women.He separated male and female students and ordered the men to leave.

But his tolerance is only remarkable in contrast to his hardline predecessor, and church doctrine remains unchanged.It is also true that the Reform and to an extent the Conservative streams of Judaism have moderated their tone where gays are concerned.Not so Islam. That religion remains largely hostile to gays, and anti-gay sentiment is woven into the laws of many Muslim countries.Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar, a British-born physician and imam, has spoken at public venues in the United States, softly and diffidently asserting that as a matter of compassion, homosexuals should be put to death.There are many, many other sheikhs like Farrokh Sekaleshfar.And while evangelical Christians don\\'t seek the death penalty for homosexuality, many do want it punished. In 2004, Dr. Richard Land, the Oxford-educated former president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, told me on camera he thought gay sex should be outlawed.\\xa0In any event, this much is singularly true: the worst mass murder in American history was directed at one group, and it was done by some one who had sworn allegiance to a fundamentalist religious group.If casual misogyny and sexist humour helped create Marc L\\xe9pine, then organized religion must reflect on helping shape a culture that will this week have led to 50 funerals in Florida. It\\'s not just the extremists who want to deprive gays of human rights.People of faith might ask themselves this: even if they\\'ve never so much as lifted a hand to a gay person, have they smiled at a homophobic joke? Or overlooked mistreatment? Or nodded during a anti-gay sermon?And if so, wouldn\\'t this be a good time to speak up?', u'In December 1989, Marc L\\xe9pine armed himself with a Ruger Mini-14 semiautomatic rifle and headed off to Montreal\\'s \\xc9cole Polytechnique, hunting women.He separated male and female students and ordered the men to leave. He then killed the women, execution-style.By the time he turned the weapon on himself, he\\'d slaughtered 14 young women for the offence of being women, earning himself a place at the apex of misogynistic violence.Lepine\\'s suicide note read, in part:\"I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker \\u2026 The feminists have always enraged me.\"\\xa0The atrocity, and its stated motivation, immediately triggered an angry and overdue conversation in Canada about misogyny and collective male guilt.Men who\\'d never as much as lifted a hand to a woman in their lives were told that even so, if they\\'d ever smiled at a sexist joke or tolerated discrimination against a woman, they\\'d done their bit to shape a culture that culminated with the funerals of those 14 girls in Montreal.It was hard to swallow, but only a dullard could reject the logic outright.And, at least partially as a result, open sexism and misogynistic humour became far less okay after Polytechnique, at least in polite company. It was a transformative moment.Now, after Omar Mateen armed himself, reportedly professed allegiance to ISIS and went hunting gays in an Orlando night club, could there possibly be a better time to have the same conversation about organized religion, and what responsibility it bears for the pain and misery and death inflicted on gays for so many centuries in the name of god?And not just the Muslim god. That is happening now because of Mateen, and deservedly so, but restricting the discussion to Islam is far too easy.Islam may be more overt about its homophobia than the other major religions \\u2014 anyone who\\'s worked in the Middle East has heard some fool in high office declaring that there are no gays in Islam, and therefore no AIDS \\u2014 but the fact is, conservative iterations of all the monotheistic faiths are deeply and actively and systemically anti-gay.The sacred monotheistic texts contain prohibitions that would by just about any legal definition be considered hate speech in the modern secular world.The Old Testament Book of Leviticus 20:13 states: \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\"The Qu\\'ran proscribes sex between Muslim males, and mandates punishment, although it does sometimes allow for leniency. Elsewhere, though, it cites the destruction of Sodom, held as divine punishment for homosexual sex, as a lesson.And the Hadith, the Qu\\'ranic commentaries, contain references to punishing the \"abomination\" of gay sex with stoning or immolation.Such prohibitions could be dismissed as antediluvian anachronisms, not to be taken seriously in the modern world.But of course they are taken quite seriously. Deadly seriously.Fundamentalists and traditionalists of all three faiths not only regard such passages as divine instruction, they actually portray their homophobia as a matter of religious freedom; something noble, protected by constitutions and essential to democracy, when in fact they are working to oppress and deny fundamental rights to people based solely upon the sexuality with which they were born.A perfect example is Proposition 8, the California ballot initiative whose purpose was to block the advance of same-sex marriage, on the grounds that it would somehow harm or invalidate heterosexual marriage, and would result in schoolchildren being taught that gay sex is normal and acceptable.Prop 8 proponents included the Roman Catholic Church, the Knights of Columbus, the California Catholic Conference of bishops, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormons), the Union of Orthodox Jewish Organizations of America and assorted evangelical Christian groups.

       "[u'Toronto police plan to boost their presence at local Pride events following the mass shooting inside a gay nightclub in Florida that killed 50 people early Sunday, organizers say.Police Chief Mark Saunders tweeted Sunday that local officers are \"actively reassessing\" security plans for the city\\'s month-long Pride events, a sentiment echoed by Pride Toronto who issued a statement saying it would \"continue to work with our full security team\" throughout the festival.Pride organizers and police plan to meet Monday morning to review security plans for the rest of the month\\'s celebrations. The chief has also committed to posting more officers near the Village and areas where events will be happening, Pride\\'s executive director Mathieu\\xa0Chantelois said.Toronto police have not made any other decisions about changes to Pride events in the city, Const. Jenifferjit Sidhu said Sunday. Sidhu said the force\\'s LGBT liaison officer has reached out to counterparts in Florida and to Pride Toronto to assess any threats.The celebratory nature of Pride has been already been shadowed by the shooting, with a candlelight vigil planned on Church Street Sunday night to honour the 50 who died and the 53 injured in the shooting at Pulse nightclub.Chantelois said that he was sickened by both the hatred and the violence in Florida, saying that he had still been unable to eat by late afternoon.\"What happened has already changed what this Pride month is about,\" he said. \"There\\'s not one march, not one rally, not one human rights panel that we will not address it. And on July 3, when a million of us will take the street, it\\'s going to be in everyone\\'s mind.\"\\xa0Pride events have always been about a creating an place for people to feel safe to be themselves. Chantelois said he and police are meeting Monday to ensure that organizers have taken all the steps they need to make sure that the LGBT community feels physically safe during this year\\'s celebrations.\"We\\'re meeting with police, we\\'re meeting with the RCMP and we\\'re going to look again at our plan and see how we can make it more solid,\" he said. \"This is what pride is all about, creating a safe space where we can all be together.\"Past Pride celebrations have been loving and inclusive, the director of LGBT organization the 519 said Sunday. And while John Farrell said that he expects organizers will review security plans, he does not believe there will be major changes to the events.\"We do take comfort in the fact that our Pride Month celebrations have existed for many years now and they have been marked by love, celebration and participation,\" he said.The co-chair for Toronto\\'s Pride events confirmed that there would be an increased police presence at Sunday\\'s candlelight vigil\\xa0\\u2014 something that may continue throughout the month depending on the discussions with officers, Alica Hall said.\"I definitely think this is a tragedy for our community and there will be people who are fearful [because] violence is, unfortunately, a part of the LGBT experience,\" she said. \"There are people out there who definitely have hatred toward the LGBT community, but I\\'m confident that we can work with Toronto Police Services and RCMP to create a safe space for our community and our lives.\"',\n",

       " u'Brooke Henderson kept hearing the roar of fans echoing through the trees, leaving her to wonder what was happening elsewhere on the golf course.By the end, all those roars were left just for her. And for good reason.\"The way the noise echoed here was really cool,\" Henderson said. \"I\\'d never experienced that before. ... And then a lot of those cheers ended up being for me, which was even cooler.\"Henderson won her first major title Sunday, beating top-ranked Lydia Ko with a birdie on the first hole of a playoff to win the KPMG Women\\'s PGA Championship after overcoming a three-shot deficit on the back nine.The 18-year-old Canadian, ranked No. 4 in the world, closed with a bogey-free 6-under 65 \\u2014 the best round of the week at Sahalee Country Club \\u2014 to match Ko at 6-under 278. Ko finished with a 67.In the playoff on the par-4 18th, Henderson hit her second shot \\u2014 a 7-iron from 155 yards \\u2014 to 3 feet, while Ko\\'s second from farther back in the fairway left her with 20 feet. Ko missed to the left, and Henderson tapped in to cap a week that started with a hole-in-one on her fourth hole Thursday and ended with a major championship.Henderson became the second-youngest winner in a major championship, with Ko the youngest last year in the Evian Championship in France. Henderson also is the second Canadian woman to win a major championship, following Sandra Post\\'s victory in the 1968 event, and is projected to jump from fourth to second in the world on Monday. Her first victory came last year in Portland, Oregon.\"To think about all of the incredible players that have\\xa0come before me,\" Henderson said. \"I was ready some of the names on this trophy and it\\'s very, very cool.\"Ko was bidding to become the fifth player in tour history to win three straight majors. Most times a bogey-free round with four birdies would be enough.\"I\\'m happy with the way I played. I just got outplayed,\" the New Zealander said. \"For Brooke to shoot 65 on the final day at a major, at a course like this is very impressive.\"The final round was a display of nearly flawless golf from the best after players spent the first three rounds getting kicked around at difficult Sahalee. Henderson, Ko and third-place Ariya Jutanugarn played a combined 56 holes on the final day without a bogey. Jutanugarn, in search of a fourth straight victory, shot a 66 to finish a stroke back. The 20-year Thai player missed a birdie putt on the 18th that could have put her into the playoff.But no one was better than Henderson, who was the first round leader after a 67 before shooting consecutive rounds of 73. Three times she saved par out of the bunker, although her best save came the first time she played the 18th. Henderson\\'s tee shot found the trees right of the fairway, but she scrambled to make a 12-footer to finish out a back nine of 31.That moment likely decided the tournament. While Henderson saved par on 18, Ko missed a 4-foot birdie try on the par-3 17th after a perfect tee shot.\"I\\'m not really sure if I pushed it,\" Ko said. \"I didn\\'t feel like it was a bad stroke.\"Henderson began the day at even par, two strokes behind Ko. The Canadian pulled off the comeback with a perfect back nine after going out in 2 under. Henderson\\'s 90-foot eagle putt from the front of the green at the 11th was just the third at the long par 5 all week and separated her from a large pack at 2 under.\"We needed to go on a birdie run or something so that sort of jump started us and we were able to keep going,\" said Brittany Henderson, her sister\\'s caddie.Ko answered with a birdie at the 11th, but Henderson drew another huge roar with a birdie at the 13th to stay one shot behind. Both continued to make pars until the 17th when Henderson pulled even by dropping a 35-foot birdie putt after pulling her tee shot to the wrong side of the green on the par 3.But Henderson had one more birdie remaining that will only raise the expectations for the Canadian star.\"Looking forward to the rest of the summer. There\\'s still three major championships left. I\\'d like to get my name on all three of those,\" Henderson said. \"But I won\\'t get ahead of myself here.\"',\n",
