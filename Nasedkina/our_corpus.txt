canada : [u'A University of Alberta student has accused private school company Bridge International Academies used intimidation tactics after he was arrested last month in Uganda while researching its schools.Ugandan police arrested\xa0Curtis Riep\xa0on May 30 for allegations of\xa0trespassing and impersonation. They dropped both charges the next day.Riep\xa0said he believes the arrest was orchestrated by Bridge International Academies. He said his research could\xa0cast the schools in a negative light.\xa0"This has been like nothing I\'ve ever experienced," he\xa0said about the arrest.Riep, a PhD\xa0candidate in the\xa0University\xa0of Alberta\'s\xa0Department of Educational Policy Studies,\xa0was investigating\xa0the chain of low-fee private schools run by Bridge International Academies in Uganda.\xa0Riep\xa0said he went to several BIA schools in Uganda to find out more about their teaching methods, and claimed he was warmly welcomed by staff. He didn\'t have a formal agreement with the organization to do research on their property, but said he did arrange an interview\xa0with two of its executives in the country\'s capital of Kampala.He met them\xa0at a cafe and\xa0said a detective and two uniformed police officers appeared at their\xa0table before the coffee did. They took\xa0Riep\xa0to a police station in\xa0Kyengera, about 13 kilometres away,\xa0for questioning.When they arrived at the station,\xa0Riep\xa0said a cohort of local reporters\xa0stood waiting for him."As soon as I stepped out of the car, they started taking photos of me, kind of bombarding me with questions,"\xa0Riep\xa0said.The organization\xa0has since taken\xa0responsibility for the allegations\xa0that led to\xa0Riep\'s arrest.\xa0They claim he\xa0impersonated a BIA employee to unlawfully\xa0get into five of their schools."We are open to anyone that wants to come and see the way we work," said Lucy Bradlow, a spokesperson for BIA.\xa0"For purely safety reasons, we can\'t allow someone around young children that\'s pretending to be someone he\'s not."But Riep said he identified himself at every school he went to, calling ahead to announce his visit wherever possible.According to Riep, the allegations were\xa0fabricated, which he said he was able to prove to police because\xa0he signed into visitors\' books at each school with his full name. Riep said he\xa0also included the name of the organization that commissioned his research, a worldwide\xa0federation of teachers\' associations and unions called\xa0Education International.\u200bRiep\xa0returned to Canada on June 3, and said the arrest has left him shaken, yet determined."I think they wanted to engage in some kind of intimidation tactic to try and scare me away from doing the research which I was legitimately hired to do,"\xa0Riep\xa0said."This is my duty, this is my work and although Bridge is trying to deter me, scare me, and repress information which I have collected, they won\'t beat me down. So that\'s that."Bridge International\xa0also took out a\xa0newspaper notice in Uganda\xa0with a photo of the researcher, asking the public to report him to police."From our perspective, all we did is call the police and alert the authorities that an unknown man was walking around a primary school claiming to be someone we knew he was not,"\xa0Bradlow\xa0said.\xa0"When he called the head of our Uganda office, we called the police and the police came and arrested him."\xa0Bridge International Academies expanded into Uganda last year, and is backed by high-profile investors such\xa0as\xa0Facebook\'s\xa0Mark\xa0Zuckerberg.\xa0Its schools are for-profit and\xa0offer private education to\xa0"families who live on less than $2 US\xa0per day," according to BIA\'s\xa0website.Though students can request funding for their tuition, not all of them are eligible for sponsorship.The organization took a foothold in Uganda with seven schools last January, and now has a total of 62\xa0BIA schools throughout the country.In April, the Ugandan government suspended any further\xa0growth, citing\xa0concerns about the legality of the schools under a national education act as well as the quality of their teachers, infrastructure, methodology and curricula."Following this rapid expansion, the Ministry is greatly concerned about several issues," states a\xa0letter signed by Rose\xa0Nassali\xa0Lukwago,\xa0the permanent secretary of Uganda\'s\xa0Ministry of Education and Sports Management."Halt the expansion of the Bridge International Academies forthwith, until the Ministry establishes that these schools, and those yet to open\xa0later, are in conformity with our Basic Requirements and Minimum Standards."BIA acknowledged its expansion in Uganda has\xa0been suspended, but Bradlow said it\'s all\xa0part of a standard two-year registration process for private schools\xa0in the country."They wanted to make sure we completed the registration process for our longest-running schools before we continued," Bradlow said.

But it has\xa0 those\xa0regulations\xa0following the recent mauling of a woman in Montreal\'s east end.\xa0Here are a few of the ways different municipalities deal with\xa0dogs and dog owners.Many cities around the world ban\xa0pit bulls. Such regulations, however, have been the target of much criticism\xa0and many cities are now reversing their policies.\xa0The Quebec College of Veterinarians, like the Montreal\xa0SPCA, argues banning breeds creates "a false sense of security" and does not necessarily reduce the number of bites. It gives the example of Ontario, which has banned four breeds of dogs considered to be pit bulls since 2005, only to see the number of dog bites increase."Banning a breed means in the long term there will be other mixing of races, creating another dangerous animal that people will love,"\xa0said\xa0Val\xe9rie\xa0Trudel, president of the Association of Veterinarians of Quebec."Banning a breed skirts the problem."\xa0\xa0Saint-Leonard,\xa0Outremont, Anjou, Drummondville, Saguenay, Rimouski, Winnipeg (first Canadian city to ban pit bulls in 1990) and Ontario.Other municipalities prohibit dangerous dogs regardless of breed.In the Montreal borough of\xa0Rivi\xe8re-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles, for instance,\xa0a dog that bites, tries to bite, attacks or tries to attack a person or another animal can be declared dangerous by an expert from the borough.The expert may order the dog be euthanized or impose conditions such as sterilization, having them microchipped, or even\xa0having them undergo\xa0behavioural therapy.\xa0Gatineau\xa0specifies that pit bull terriers, Staffordshire\xa0bull terriers and\xa0American Staffordshire\xa0terriers are subject to special municipal regulations.

Berlin, but also in Lower Saxony, in northern Germany, since 2013 and in Switzerland since 2008.Many municipalities encourage dog owners to sterilize their animals. In Quebec, according to the Quebec College of Veterinarians, 75 to 80 per cent of dogs are sterilized."Sterilization greatly reduces running away and aggression,"\xa0said\xa0Michel\xa0Pepin, spokesman for the college."Males that aren\'t castrated\xa0are much more aggressive and tend to want to fight. Their hunting drives are\xa0greater \u2026\xa0 [and] the dog is harder to control, harder to train."He pointed out that some municipalities have tried to force owners to sterilize their dogs, "but it\'s not easy to control." He does not believe that compulsory sterilization is the ideal solution. He proposes instead to reward "good citizens," such as those who sterilize their dogs, by giving them a discount on the licence for the animal. In some European countries, including Belgium (compulsory sterilization of all dogs since Jan. 1).Pepin said more needs to be done to enforce rules about leashes in public places. "The fines aren\'t very high, and there is nobody on the ground to implement it," he said."The city will have some patrollers this summer, but for the whole city. You can walk a long time before someone notices that your dog is loose."Pepin said he believes there should be regulations that punish citizens who fail to keep their dogs in a closed yard. If the dog escapes the yard, the owners should be held responsible, he said. Many municipalities require residents to keep their dog on a leash at all times in public places.The Quebec College of Veterinarians, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the Universit\xe9 de Montr\xe9al and the Montreal\xa0SPCA\xa0are all in favour of wearing halters to prevent bites. The head harness prevents the dog from biting while allowing it to breathe, unlike a muzzle.\xa0Sainte-Julie has just adopted a regulation requiring the wearing of halters in public places for dogs weighing\xa020 kilograms and more, starting in September.According to Pepin, municipalities should reward those who register, microchip and sterilize their animals.An ideal regulation, he said, would include: Quebec City, Drummondville, Verdun and Saint-Hyacinthe.', u'Quebec has a patchwork system of regulations for dogs.

"Big war games can take months to set up and cost an awful lot of money."The ISIS Crisis is only the latest gaming experiment in the federal government, which has been late to so-called "gamification" trends. The private sector has been using computer-based games for training for several years, recognizing their efficiency and effectiveness, especially among younger workers.Last summer, Employment and Social Development Canada ran two gaming experiments over six weeks with 460 of its employees.Using two suppliers, Quebec-based Ellicom and Ottawa-based Launchfire, computer-based games were used to teach workers about digital security on department networks."This is an effective and desired method of learning \u2026 we should embrace gamified learning as a viable alternative to traditional methods, says a November 2015 report on the results, obtained under the Access to Information Act."It doesn\'t feel like work when you\'re earning points, reaching new levels and getting to the top of the leaderboard."Some government planners say gaming may also have potential for directly engaging citizens.Ermel says his military-planning unit, which has never before played matrix-type games, is using The ISIS Crisis to "stress test" forecasting methodology rather than to predict Mideast events or any long-term Canadian role\xa0in the region.The planners use 10 potential scenarios, from routine operations in the Arctic to all-out war, to estimate what the Canadian Forces will need to function 30 years down the road. Adding a matrix-type game to the process can help keep the military aware of potential innovations introduced by adversaries.The Canadian Forces will decide in the fall whether to make the game a regular part of its planning process, Ermel said.Brynen says the gaming approach has been proven successful in other contexts."It has also been used analytically in certain national\xa0security communities, so that kind of game format was used for security planning for the Vancouver Olympics," he said in an interview.Last month, Brynen ran another board-game session for the military\xa0to explore responses to a humanitarian crisis caused by an earthquake in the fictional country of Carana.The game, called Aftershock, is designed for up to eight players and takes about two hours to play.', u'Pity the poor Pagans.

It lurks mainly in the French version of the anthem, about which the ungodly have muttered for years.The English version, of course, does invoke the Almighty:\xa0"God keep our land glorious and free!"But the French version, which preceded the English one and is not a translation, seems noticeably more militant in its invocation of a\xa0crusading Christianity.Literally, that\'s\xa0"because your arm knows\xa0how to carry a sword, it knows how to carry the cross." So we are deep into "Onward, Christian soldiers" territory. We\'re armed, and we\'re spreading the gospel of Jesus.Perhaps, if you\'d asked Adolphe-Basile Routhier, the author of the French lyrics, why he excluded other religions that don\'t revere any cross, he might have replied, "Because it\'s 1880."And it was.

No doubt, many of these folks might not mind if a generic, interfaith\xa0god keeps our land glorious and free \u2014 but are they supposed to revere the crucifix? The central icon of Christianity?Next, consider those who don\'t want any religious label at all. Add up all the atheists, the humanists and agnostics, then throw in all those who just said, \'No thanks, no religion\'\xa0... and you quickly reach nearly eight\xa0million Canadians.

After another\xa0five less-than-glorious years for religious faith, it\'s hard to believe those numbers won\'t grow.These\xa0faithless millions might well\xa0begin to wonder, then, if they should\xa0remain politely mute\xa0about the godly content of the national anthem.

Its bulk\xa0causes even more mayhem than you can on your own, but it also bestows an entirely new category of powers. Think of them\xa0as Kirby's powers but\xa0overclocked.\xa0Some of them are genuinely surprising \u2014\xa0the Jet power, for example, turns the\xa0Robobot\xa0into a fighter aircraft, as the level morphs\xa0into a\xa0side-scrolling shooter\xa0like\xa0.The\xa0Robobot\xa0doesn't reinvent the series'\xa0gameplay, it merely expands on it, adding some freshness to the proceedings without feeling out of place.Kirby games have always been easier than most other\xa0platform\xa0games, and\xa0\xa0is no exception. It's probably even easier than usual, since the\xa0Robobot\xa0allows players to run roughshod over everything in their path.But while some\xa0hardcore\xa0gamers may scoff at the series, it's the playfulness and flexibility\xa0that\xa0stand out.\xa0Everything about Kirby's world and the way he plays is full of whimsy and fun. Its strength is in its lack of challenge. It invites you to try out new powers and new ways to play, even as it throws carefully crafted environmental puzzles at a regular pace.The handheld's 3D capabilities add depth to the playground as well, and you'll often travel between a stage's foreground and background, manipulating elements in one to clear a path in the other.

Its buttoned-down president goes about his business with a condescending colonist\xa0attitude to the natives.It's an\xa0unusual turn that only shows up in a few brief\xa0cutscenes, but sets the stage for an absolutely bonkers final boss sequence that I won't spoil for fans (who can find it on\xa0YouTube\xa0if they want).The main quest isn't especially long \u2014\xa0you'll be able to blast through it during\xa0a lazy afternoon\xa0\u2014\xa0but added modes like a boss rush and another starring Kirby's\xa0Batman-like\xa0rival\xa0Meta\xa0Knight will provide some extra crunch for purists.A final note, though: thrifty gamers worried by the $50 price tag\xa0can grab most of Kirby's back catalogue\xa0for only a few dollars apiece on\xa0Nintendo's\xa0Virtual Console archives.

Think of them\xa0as Kirby's powers but\xa0overclocked.\xa0Some of them are genuinely surprising \u2014\xa0the Jet power, for example, turns the\xa0Robobot\xa0into a fighter aircraft, as the level morphs\xa0into a\xa0side-scrolling shooter\xa0like\xa0.The\xa0Robobot\xa0doesn't reinvent the series'\xa0gameplay, it merely expands on it, adding some freshness to the proceedings without feeling out of place.Kirby games have always been easier than most other\xa0platform\xa0games, and\xa0\xa0is no exception. It's probably even easier than usual, since the\xa0Robobot\xa0allows players to run roughshod over everything in their path.But while some\xa0hardcore\xa0gamers may scoff at the series, it's the playfulness and flexibility\xa0that\xa0stand out.\xa0Everything about Kirby's world and the way he plays is full of whimsy and fun. Its strength is in its lack of challenge. It invites you to try out new powers and new ways to play, even as it throws carefully crafted environmental puzzles at a regular pace.The handheld's 3D capabilities add depth to the playground as well, and you'll often travel between a stage's foreground and background, manipulating elements in one to clear a path in the other. It's an old trick seen in\xa0platformers\xa0over the decades, but the\xa03DS's\xa0capabilities make it pop in a way a traditional screen can't.'s\xa0antagonists, a corporate invasion force called the\xa0Haltmann\xa0Works Company, add a faint political tone to the series' normal\xa0playfulness.\xa0The company is\xa0set to extracting the natural resources of Kirby's home world, mechanizing the landscape in the process. Its buttoned-down president goes about his business with a condescending colonist\xa0attitude to the natives.It's an\xa0unusual turn that only shows up in a few brief\xa0cutscenes, but sets the stage for an absolutely bonkers final boss sequence that I won't spoil for fans (who can find it on\xa0YouTube\xa0if they want).The main quest isn't especially long \u2014\xa0you'll be able to blast through it during\xa0a lazy afternoon\xa0\u2014\xa0but added modes like a boss rush and another starring Kirby's\xa0Batman-like\xa0rival\xa0Meta\xa0Knight will provide some extra crunch for purists.A final note, though: thrifty gamers worried by the $50 price tag\xa0can grab most of Kirby's back catalogue\xa0for only a few dollars apiece on\xa0Nintendo's\xa0Virtual Console archives. They still play as well now as when they first hit stores, so you might want to start there instead.", u'Ontario is on the right path to accommodate the\xa0boost in the number of electric vehicles on\xa0the province\'s\xa0roads that the government hopes to see\xa0in the coming years, say industry analysts.\xa0But there are still challenges\xa0ahead, including\xa0increasing\xa0the number of fast\xa0charging stations available and\xa0convincing skeptical motorists to embrace\xa0electric cars."To get that\xa0infrastructure\xa0in\xa0place now is going to be critical," said Brian Millar,\xa0a spokesman for Plug\'nDrive, an advocacy organization for elective vehicles. "Otherwise,\xa0we\xa0will wake up one day and\xa0realize\xa0\'Oh darn,\xa0we don\'t have\xa0any electrical vehicle\xa0infrastructure."Electrical vehicles are not a passing fad. They\xa0will\xa0just\xa0increase in\xa0popularity."Earlier this week, Ontario Premier Kathleen\xa0Wynne\xa0unveiled the Liberal government\'s $8.3 billion climate change plan, which aims to see\xa0electric cars make up five per\xa0cent of new vehicle sales by 2020.According to the plan,\xa0Ontario will continue to offer rebates of up to $14,000\xa0for electric vehicles, including up to $1,000 for installing a home\xa0charging station, and will provide free overnight charging for\xa0residential customers for four years, starting in 2017.The province is looking to make it mandatory for\xa0all new homes and\xa0townhomes\xa0with garages to\xa0have\xa0a 50-amp, 240-volt receptacle (plug) in the garage for the purpose of charging electric vehicles.

health : ['Experts are questioning widely circulated Health Canada claims that the drug W-18 is 100 times more powerful than fentanyl, or that the new arrival to the illicit-drug scene is even technically an opioid.Dr. David Juurlink, head of pharmacology and toxicology at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, said that while W-18 could very well be dangerous more research is needed before conclusions can be drawn about its chemical behaviour and potency."The main thing we know is that we don\'t know very much," Juurlink said in an interview. "It\'s clearly a chemical and it does something but what exactly it does is not clear."What is known is that W-18 is a synthetic compound created and patented at a University of Alberta laboratory as a potential pain reliever in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was one of 32 chemicals produced in the so-called W-series, none of which were ever produced commercially.As of June 1, Canada made it illegal to produce, possess, import, export or traffic W-18 after the substance was identified during several illicit-drug seizures.Researchers looking at the chemical structure suggest the compound doesn\'t bind to opioid receptors in the body the way fentanyl or other opioids do, Juurlink said.The inventor of W-18 also disputes the claims being made about the chemical. Retired chemist Ed Knaus said that while the other compounds in the W-series behaved in some ways like opioids, that same behaviour wasn\'t displayed in W-18."It\'s always possible (that it\'s an opioid) because we didn\'t prove the mechanism of action," Knaus said. He added that W-18 isn\'t necessarily 10,000 more toxic or dangerous than morphine."The problem here is that the press and everybody extrapolates (and) people start to equate numbers," said Knaus."They say that this thing is 100 times more potent than fentanyl and fentanyl is 100 times more potent than morphine, so automatically it\'s 10,000. Well, we never tested fentanyl in our case."Knaus said he was "saddened and disturbed" that after so many years someone would exploit W-18 for use as an illicit drug.The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has since backtracked on information it released in January describing W-18 as an opioid 100 times more toxic than fentanyl."That information was what was available to us back at the end of last year, and there has since been a lot more interest and some more supposition," said Jane Buxton, the head of the centre\'s harm reduction office.Health Canada did not respond to a request for comment, but it appears the information included in its fact sheet comes from preliminary research in the original nine-page patent application, dated Aug. 28, 1984.That same research information was circulated by the Centre for Disease Control, said the organization\'s head, Mark Tyndall.The study used mice to test the pain-relieving activity of all the W-series compounds and the results were compared to several other drugs, including aspirin and morphine.The research found it takes 10,000 times more morphine than W-18 to produce the same analgesic effect.That doesn\'t make the drug 10,000 times more dangerous than morphine, said Bryan Roth, a pharmacologist at the University of North Carolina."All this means is that if you\'re a mouse ... you could be given a dose of W-18 that\'s 10,000 times less than a dose of morphine and you would have basically an equivalent effect," said Roth, who is conducting research on W-18."It may be a dangerous drug, but we don\'t know that. There\'s no data out there."It\'s prudent to be concerned about it though, given that a poorly understood compound is showing up on the illicit market, he added.Roth raised the concern that if W-18 turns out to be toxic but not an opioid, then standard overdose-reversing agents such as naloxone would be ineffective.Juurlink said there are plenty of other drugs to focus on that warrant the attention of police forces and regulators and doctors and end users."We should focus on them and spend less time catastrophizing on the issue of W-18."', 'Experts are questioning widely circulated Health Canada claims that the drug W-18 is 100 times more powerful than fentanyl, or that the new arrival to the illicit-drug scene is even technically an opioid.Dr. David Juurlink, head of pharmacology and toxicology at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, said that while W-18 could very well be dangerous more research is needed before conclusions can be drawn about its chemical behaviour and potency."The main thing we know is that we don\'t know very much," Juurlink said in an interview.

Not anymore.Today\'s MS patients aim for something called "no evidence of disease activity," a state that is achieved by using drugs that stop the immune system from attacking brain cells."We put them on a medication with very low risk and with very low complications and procedures," says Dr. Jock Murray, a Halifax neurologist who has been treating MS patients for decades."Some of these things are just pills. Some are injections. There\'s one, you take the treatment for five days, and a year later you take it for two days, and then you never take it again.""Most [MS] patients in Canada are on one of these drugs," he said.In other words, one of\xa0 the major reasons why today\'s bone marrow transplant story is not relevant to 95 per cent of MS patients is that they won\'t need it."I\'ve treated more than 100 people with this [drug] treatment," said Dr. Anthony Traboulsee, medical director of the MS clinic at UBC Hospital in Vancouver."In up to 40 to 50 per cent of patients, many of their symptoms will reverse. And that\'s the cool part," he said. "Fifteen years ago we were telling people, \'We might be able to take the edge off your disease.\'\xa0Now we can say we have a good chance of shutting it down," he said."Now I\'m telling people when newly diagnosed, that my gut feeling is we\'ve got a 90 per cent\xa0chance of controlling\xa0this super well for you, and you will have a normal or near normal life."None of this diminishes the work of the Ottawa team reporting the results of a 15-year study into bone marrow transplants for MS. The research is much admired by the neurology community for its rigour and care. It\'s just not new."We\'ve known the results all the way along. It\'s been over 14 years," said\xa0Murray. "From the start we knew this was not going to be a therapy for everybody. But we would learn a lot."The concept is to give MS patients, already suffering from an untreatable form of the disease, a new immune system using a procedure similar to the one that has been used to treat leukemia and other cancers for years."Ablate the bone marrow and immune system,\' said Murray. "And give them back a new immune system using their own cells."Several groups around the world have done similar studies. The Ottawa researchers used stronger chemotherapy\xa0and were more selective in the cells they transplanted.\xa0And they waited years before reporting their results, to be certain that the disease had been halted in the 24 patients, and that the symptoms had improved in almost half of them.In addition to offering a new option for the most desperate MS patients, the Ottawa research also acts as a proof of principle that\xa0the immune system is the key to controlling the disease."We know the immune system is the actor involved. We don\'t know why it initiated this damage to the nervous system or what it\'s specifically trying to attack. All we know is there is great evidence that the process is of immune cells getting into the brain and causing an inflammatory reaction\xa0that destroys myelin and eventually destroys axons," said Murray.']

Now a group of scientists has urged U.K. voters to remain in the European Union, warning Saturday that Britain will lose funding, global influence and access to expertise if the nation votes to leave the 28-nation bloc.Thirteen Nobel laureates wrote an open letter to the Daily Telegraph newspaper, arguing that the prospect of losing EU research funding was a key risk to science. They argued that the notion that Britain\'s Treasury can make up for any funding shortfall as "naive and complacent," given that successive governments have allowed support for research to languish."We may be an island, but we cannot be an island in science," they wrote.

Much of the production that was shut down, if it\'s not already back online, is expected to be by the end of June.\xa0', u'Alberta is still many months away from knowing exactly what the wildfires around Fort McMurray will mean for the economy, but some costs, such as the royalty revenues the province will miss out on this year, are\xa0starting to take shape.\xa0The numbers, perhaps surprisingly, may be smaller than you might think.When the threat of the wildfires was at its peak in the last month, more than 1.1 million barrels a day of oilsands production was shut down.\xa0That amounts to nearly 30 per cent of Canada\'s total daily oil production, a disruption to supply that was big enough to play a role in the recent rise\xa0by\xa0oil prices around the world."[The wildfires]\xa0impacted the global market leading to the increase in prices up to $50 US a barrel," said Nicole Leonard, with Platts Analytics Consulting.\xa0"A full month is a long time to have your production shut-in."By the end of June, the cumulative production loss from the wildfires will likely approach 40 million barrels, according to an estimate in a recent research note by FirstEnergy Capital analyst Martin King.\xa0Figuring out what 40 million barrels of oil means for Alberta\'s royalty take isn\'t straightforward.A number of moving parts go into calculating\xa0the amount the province collects from the oilsands, including whether a project has been profitable long enough to pay back the costs of getting up and running \u2014\xa0a split known in the industry as pre-payout and post-payout \u2014\xa0as well as the price that companies actually fetch for their bitumen. \xa0For those reasons and others, Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci\xa0isn\'t yet ready to put a number on what the wildfires will mean for royalties.\xa0"It\'s too soon to know,"\xa0Ceci told reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference in Calgary this week. "But\xa0we\'re working on those projections."While the government is understandably hesitant to comment, some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the eventual royalty hit, while not ideal for a province that\'s already in a recession, won\'t unduly affect Alberta\'s fiscal health.\xa0Using a conservative estimate for bitumen prices, courtesy of Sarah Dobson, a research associate at the University of Calgary\'s School of Public Policy, as well as assumptions for the royalty rates paid by projects that have curtailed production, the wildfires could cost Alberta as little as $17 million in oilsands royalties.\xa0"I would expect [the impact]\xa0would be rather minimal. Although, in this day when you have a deficit,\xa0a dollar is not minimal, I suppose,"\xa0said Barry Rodgers,\xa0a former high-ranking Alberta civil servant in the energy department.\xa0Based on the provincial government\'s spring budget, Alberta\xa0is forecast to earn $656 million from oilsands royalties this year, while running a deficit of around $10 billion.\xa0Crunching the numbers using the government\'s\xa0forecast, the potential royalty hit works out to about $27 million.\xa0Even at that amount, the foregone royalties are\xa0relatively small\xa0for a province that\'s\xa0expecting total\xa0revenues of more than $41 billion this year.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The wildfires do, of course, come with other wrinkles\xa0that could affect the government\'s eventual royalty take.\xa0"If these oilsands companies can look at starting to deduct some of the expenses they have incurred as part of the evacuation or the restart, those are things they may be able to use that rightly reflect their cost of doing business," said\xa0Benjamin Dachis, who has researched royalty systems for the C.D. Howe\xa0Institute.
