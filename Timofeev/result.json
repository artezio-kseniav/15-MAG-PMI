He'll be up against five challengers including Olympic sailing legend Ben Ainslie, who next year hopes to be Britain's first victor since sailing's premier event began in 1851. \nLipton, a self-made man who was born into poverty in Glasgow, was the most persistent challenger in the America's Cup, plowing millions of dollars into five campaigns between 1899 and 1930 through the Royal Ulster Yacht Club. But all of his Shamrock boats were defeated, endearing him to the American public as a \"folk hero\" and \"lovable loser\" according to the event website.\nLipton wasn't the only illustrious name involved in the America's Cup at the turn of the last century. U.S. financier John Pierpont Morgan co-owned the 1899 and 1901 Cup winner Columbia, while the Vanderbilt family, whose wealth came from railroads and shipping, helped fund three Cup winners between 1895 and 1937.\nThe closest Lipton came to winning was in 1920, when Shamrock IV took the first two races before Resolute won the next three to retain the trophy for the New York Yacht Club. \nThat series was highly anticipated across North America, with New York hotels having to turn people away because they were at full capacity, while special trains brought in spectators from Canada, the New York Times reported on July 15, 1920.\n\"Resolute Wins Final Race By 19 Minutes 45 Seconds; America's Cup Stays Here,\" headlined the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 28, 1920.  \nLipton's relentless pursuit of success helped put the event on the map in the U.S., Bob Fisher, a sailing historian and author of numerous books on the sport, said by phone from Lymington on the English south coast.  \n\"He was much loved by America and the Americans,\" Fisher said. \"He was persistent, he wanted to win the Cup and spent a lot of money doing so.\" \nLipton may have spent as much as $2 million on his two challenges in 1920 and 1930, Rousmaniere estimated. That's roughly $27 million \nin today's money\n. \nBorn in 1848, Thomas Johnstone Lipton became interested in the sport when he persuaded his parents to let him sail to New York from Scotland when he was just 14 years old, according to the America's Cup Hall of Fame website. \nWhile in the U.S., he learned about the grocery trade and the power of advertising. Lipton returned home to his parents in Scotland five years later. \nBy 1914, he'd expanded the family's grocery shop into 500 stores -- laying the foundation \nfor the nation's first supermarket chain.\n He also created the Lipton tea brand, which is still in existence today.\nAlthough Lipton never won the Cup and wasn't much a sailor himself, his highly-publicized attempts boosted his business in the U.S. as it helped promote his tea, Fisher said.  \nThe 1920 race was the 13th edition of the America's Cup, and the first since 1903 after the outbreak of World War I prevented the race from taking place in 1914. \nAfter New York Harbor became too busy with commercial shipping, the 14th edition moved to Newport, Rhode Island in 1930. It stayed there until 1983 when Alan Bond's Australia II beat Liberty to end the NYYC's 132-year dominance, the longest in sports.\nDuring the 1920 races, New York Harbor was so filthy with oil and coal that the yachts had to be hauled out every two days to be cleaned, Rousmaniere said.\n\"The only person who wanted to have it in New York was Sir Thomas Lipton,\" Rousmaniere said. \"All the people from his club and the New York Yacht Club wanted to have it in Newport where there was better wind, cleaner water and better sailing. But Lipton had a lot of followers and friends in New York and he made the decision. Most people would say it was the wrong decision because the wind was very poor for his boat.\"  \nLipton didn't fare much better in his final attempt a decade later in Newport, where Shamrock IV was beaten by Enterprise -- skippered by Harold \"Mike\" Vanderbilt. \nLipton's reward after the final race: a specially designed cup for \"the best of all losers.\"\nVanderbilt, who was a schoolboy when Lipton launched the first of his five challenges in 1899, preferred sailing over the family railroad business. A triple America's Cup-winning skipper, he helped develop the yacht racing rules, according to the America's Cup Hall of Fame website. \nVanderbilt summed up the feelings of the American public after the final 1930 race. \n\"Uppermost in our minds is a feeling of sympathy for that grand old sportsman, Sir Thomas Lipton, with whom our relations have been so pleasant,\" he said. \nAlthough this was \"perhaps his last attempt to lift the America's Cup,\" Vanderbilt said, \"it has been our duty to shut the door in his face. In defeat lies the test of true sportsmanship, and he has proved to be a wonderful sportsman, quite the finest it has ever been our good fortune to race against.\"\nCNN's Sailing Success show goes behind the scenes in America's Cup racing\nWho will win the 2017 America's Cup?

Sound familiar? Not quite. \nThe game is \"Counter Strike.\" The team, Fnatic. Welcome to the world of eSports.\nOrigins of an eSports juggernaut\nSam Mathews is one of the major players in this digital realm, which has a global audience of more than 290 million people -- more than the NHL, according to research firm \nNewzoo\n. \nHe set up \nFnatic\n in 2004, having sold his car and invested \u00a35,000 ($7,200) in sending the team to an eSports event in Las Vegas.\n \"It was thought upon as odd the first time I did it,\" he recalls. \"But when they won \u00a320,000 ($29,000) it was thought of as not odd and suddenly like, 'Whoa, how did they win?'\" \nAn avid gamer, Mathews was an early believer in eSports -- an industry where players compete in everything from video games to drone racing.\nHe played under-21 rugby for professional English club Harlequins, but also competed on an eSports team as a teenager. \nHis attempts to fund a trip to a tournament offering \"millions in prize money\" taught him some early business lessons, and with some help from his mom, Anne -- who dealt with finances -- he turned his attention to founding his own team.\nThe name Fnatic reflected his desire to \"represent this audience, this community of fanatical people who see eSports as a movement.\" \nBecoming a brand\nMathews' faith in the future of the industry paid off. Fnatic moved from earning thousands of dollars in prize money playing \"Quake\" and \"Painkiller\" in 2004 to playing for millions in games such as \"Counter Strike,\" \"Dota 2\" and \"League of Legends\" in front of tens of thousands of fans in packed arenas.\n\"He early on saw the potential of eSports and the potential of Fnatic as a brand,\" the team's CEO Wouter Sleijffers -- wearing one of its branded hoodies -- says at the Intel Extreme Masters in Katowice, Poland. \n\"We have our HQ in London. We also have operations in San Francisco, Berlin, Belgrade and in Kuala Lumpur. We've grown out from 2004 as, maybe, passionate and in a clan to today a fairly big operation in eSports, doing apparel and other activities which are all about the Fnatic brand.\"\nFnatic is now one of the biggest teams in the world, along with the likes of Evil Geniuses, Natus Vincere and SK Telecom T1, but these are more than just groups of people competing for prize money. \nESports teams are increasingly becoming brands -- and for good reason. The global eSports market in 2016 is worth roughly $463 million and is set to become a billion-dollar industry by 2019, according to Newzoo.\nFnatic is already a household name. Attend any large tournament and its apparel is omnipresent. The team's players -- no matter which game -- are mobbed by fans wherever they go. \nIts media department produces content that's consumed millions of times. Capitalizing on the excitement and passion around eSports is key to any team wanting to become a brand.\n\"We're the only team designing, manufacturing and distributing their very own gaming hardware,\" says Sleijffers, who became CEO at the start of 2015.\n\"What we see in the future is not only having teams and not only working with sponsors, but to actually launch our own ventures, using the Fnatic brand and excitement -- not only for Fnatic fans, but for anyone that's passionate about eSports.\"\nBuilding success\nPatrik S\u00e4ttermon is a busy man, but Fnatic's chief gaming officer is happy to reminisce about his first console -- an early '90s Nintendo.\n\"I kind of got mesmerized from moment one. I had access to that kind of world, obviously not in the physical space, but being able to compete -- that was super fascinating to me.\"\nA former professional Counter Strike player, known as cArn, the 31-year-old is now dubbed the \"Alex Ferguson of Fnatic\" by Mathews.\nLike the legendary former Manchester United manager, it's S\u00e4ttermon's job to keep his teams at a championship level.\n\"I am more or less responsible for our gaming department ... ensuring that we are relevant. That is highest priority on my list of tasks,\" says the Swede, who has been with Fnatic for 10 years.\n\"It's very important we use our expertise and knowledge, the context that we have built up over and accumulated over this decade. We're setting up an entire framework, how we can help our players reach the next tier.\"\nThe players train \"up to 10 hours a day, five or six days a week,\" while Fnatic plans their diets, gives its Korean contingent English lessons and encourages physical fitness for all members.\n\"The connection between your physical performance and your mental performance is definitely there,\" S\u00e4ttermon says, \"so although eSports and competitive gaming is the sport of your mind, surely you can add hand and eye coordination to that. \n\"We do see our players being as fit as any other average kid, sometimes even more so.\"\nThe superstar\nLooking around from the top of the stage in Katowice after Fnatic's victory, Olof Kajbjer appears justifiably pleased -- but a bit astonished.\nKnown as \"Olofmeister,\" the Swede is widely thought of as the world's best Counter Strike player, yet he still can't quite believe what's going on.\n\"When you play, you're just so focused on playing, so you block everything out,\" the 24-year-old says.\n\"But when you win, and see everyone, like the whole arena full, it's unreal. It's hard for me to understand how big it is right now.\nMORE: Is pro gaming really a sport?\n\"It's weird.

In such a rapidly changing sport, what do the teams do next?\n\"(People have) never seen a new ecosystem come to life as eSports and that is what makes it so unique,\" Sleijffers says. \"That's why we need to stay open-minded and that's where we'll figure out where we'll be in 10 years' time.\"\nS\u00e4ttermon aims to keep Fnatic at the top.\n\"I'd like us to be more engaging with our fan base,\" he adds. \"It's hard to predict where the future is taking us, but we want to be super proactive and we want to change this space, be in the forefront.\"\nFor founder Mathews, the goal is to help eSports stars break out of their online niche.\n\"Since day one, we've always been about representing this audience in the most genuine, authentic way,\" he says. \"I want us to be one of the catalysts that helps drive eSports into the mainstream.\"\nCEO Sleijffers dreams of the day eSports will dominate water-cooler talk in offices after the weekend, not the exploits of Real Madrid, Manchester United or Barcelona. \n\"My vision is that on Mondays, people go to work and they don't talk about football,\" he says, \"but that they talk about eSports and Fnatic.

Husband Eric helps keep it all together out of their kitesurfing and windsurfing school.\nWhen they are not haring around the world competing, they are haring around the world taking guests on kitesurfing safaris or other adventures -- such as setting the record for crossing the English Channel with Richard Branson. \nSo as well as the logistics for travel, equipment, training and competition, there are the stresses and strains of normal family life, like school and work.\nIf life sounds complicated, that's because it is, but for Team Bridge it works.\nREAD: America's Cup: 'Captain' Kate rules the waves\n\"If they weren't enjoying it and they weren't happy it would be more of a strain, but the fact is they are driven by it and motivated by it -- and generally that comes because they are doing well,\" Steph told CNN Mainsail.\nSteph and Eric come from a traditional sailing and racing background --  Steph's father \"Spud\" is a boatbuilder in Devon -- and got into kitesurfing in the early days.\nThey saw what Hawaiian pioneers such as big-wave surfer and windsurfer Laird Hamilton were doing with kites in the late 1990s and began experimenting with their own kit, flying rudimentary kites on short windsurfing boards at home in Exmouth.\nThe resultant thrills -- and spills -- as they explored the new sport were \"huge amounts of fun and danger,\" says Steph.\nREAD: A superyacht for polar bear lovers\nWith her knowledge of the wind and sail-racing tactics, plus her athlete's mentality, Steph progressed quickly.  \nAfter her fourth world title she was named on the final three-person shortlist for the ISAF Rolex Sailor of the Year award in 2014, ultimately losing out to Brazilians Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze.\nFor a few months back in 2012 it looked as if Team Bridge could supply the bulk of the British kitesurf team at the Rio Olympics, when kitesurf racing was announced as a new discipline to replace windsurfing.\nSteph even texted Spud -- who at 68 had recently had a heart bypass operation -- to say he had better hang on for four more years as she was going to the Olympics.\nWhat a story that would have been -- a mother and son winning medals in the same discipline, at the same Games.\nBut an outcry from the windsurfing community over its exclusion helped persuade the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) -- now known as World Sailing -- to reverse the decision. \nHowever, in June 2015 kitesurfing was added to the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, which could pave the way for a belated debut at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.\n'Crazy not to'\nSteph concedes that might be an Olympic cycle too far for her, but she can't quite let it go. \n\"I'm very much a now person,\" she says. \"So right at this moment in time if you told me it was in I'd definitely try. It would be crazy to not want to have a go at seeing whether I could be competitive.\n\"My only concern would be the amount of time needed to commit and be particularly selfish to my training, and to give up a lot of the other bits of my life -- a family and a mother and someone that runs a few businesses. So that would be a big thing. But it wouldn't necessarily have to be for that long. \n\"It's probably a driving factor that I am getting older, because I wouldn't be able to do it in another eight years' time.\"\nOlly is also a man on a mission. At the recent Euros in Sardinia, he was second in the men's division and won the U-21 section. Without an Olympic pathway, and hence the backing and infrastructure of a national governing body, all the support functions -- kit, maintenance, training, advice, motivation -- are provided by mom or dad, depending on who is at the event.  \n\"All he's ever wanted to do is to get an Olympic medal,\" says Steph, who incidentally came second at the Euros while playing mum for \"50% of the time.\"\n\"The other two don't really get it quite yet, whereas Olly really does get it. It would be quite an emotional experience.\"\nSteph's not one for fretting -- \"worrying is no good for anything\" -- but she is wary that if kitesurfing gets Olympic status the intensity and pressure of competition would ramp up even more.\nEnjoyment the key\nThere may even be sibling rivalry to test the family's \"tidy relationship\". \n\"Maybe it's like the Murray brothers in tennis. Guy steps up a gear and realizes competition is for him and the two of them are fighting for a place,\" she says. \n\"But I don't really think that's likely, Guy is more like Andy Murray's brother, a bit more relaxed, a bit more 'teamy'.\"\nOn the other hand, she says, the boys are getting older and things will inevitably change in life anyway.\n\"Maybe they will have done so much kitesurfing, maybe by the time that comes around they're done with it and they want to do something else,\" she adds. \nWATCH: Adventurers gear up for world's longest race\n\"I wouldn't be upset about that...other than they've got talent so potentially could do quite well.\"\n\"The ambition for them is to keep enjoying it, that's the key isn't it?

I learned how to drive a forklift pretty well ... I never thought I'd learn how to weld.\"\nA couple of years ago, Dressler was an aspiring sailor who'd signed up to help build Oracle's Bermuda base for the team's 2017 title defense.\n\"This whole place, it's got a little of my blood, sweat and tears,\" he tells \nCNN's Sailing Success show.\nRead more: America's Cup - What price the ultimate prize?\n\"I had a hand in everything and I was always really drawn to -- especially the systems on board -- how everything is controlled, whether it be hydraulically or electronically or with ropes. I ended up helping out with the rope.\n\"There would be times when I was up in the rafters, and I'd be looking down at this amazing machine and thinking, 'That's crazy, I would never find myself sailing on that,  it's just such top level.\"\nHowever, Dressler's hard-working enterprise was noted by Jimmy Spithill, the skipper who led Oracle to its first \nAmerica's Cup\n success in 2010 and was again at the helm for the remarkable victory against Team New Zealand three years later, when the American syndicate came from 8-1 behind.\n\"The strength of our program in my mind is the Oracle Team shore crew -- I saw it last time when we made that comeback,\" the Australian tells CNN.   \"They do more hours than anyone, here before anyone, go out on water, servicing, stay late, getting boats ready for the next day.  They really are the unsung heroes of our team.\n\"Cooper is just a fantastic story. We get people ask us, 'How do I join the America's Cup team or the sailing team?' The most important thing is your attitude and your work ethic.\nRead more: Tea baron who became 'the best of all losers'\n\"He came in and he just wanted to help the team, wanted to work, initially for free.  And then he was involved with working with our shore team, even to the point of running electrical wires, digging trenches.  \n\"It didn't matter what job he was doing, he was always upbeat, motivated -- a great attitude.  We all saw that and we thought, 'We've just got to have this guy on our team.'\"\nLast year, Dressler was promoted to the sailing crew and given the role of grinder -- a physically taxing job operating the winches that raise the sails and move the boom.\n\"I really didn't expect it at all -- it was sort of a surprise attack,\" the 25-year-old says. \n\"I remember I had to take a little walk after that because it really was one of those 'pinch me I must be dreaming' moments.\"\nDressler graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz but spent just two months working for a geotechnical engineering firm before deciding he wanted to be a full-time sailor.\nHe competed in the 2013 Youth America's Cup, but never expected to make the step up to the top level.\n\"I never had an attitude as if, 'Oh I should be sailing on the boats -- I have a sailing background, I shouldn't be working on other stuff when I could be out there sailing,'\" he says.\n\"I never once thought that way, and I think having the right attitude is a big part of it because it's a really small community. It's a small team and you just have to work as hard as you can.\"\nDressler says he has no intention of forgetting where he came from.\n\"There's no separation between who does the hard labor at night and who's actually out on the boat going fast.

In its 10 previous meetings with Real, Atletico had only lost once -- on that night in Lisbon. \nAnd yet, for all the pregame hype surrounding Diego Simeone's side, it was Real which dominated the opening throes of the contest.\nQuiz: Test your Madrid Derby knowledge\nAnemic Atletico\nIf Real had expected its city rival to begin with the intensity and vigor it is famed for then it would have been happily surprised.\nAtletico, which finished third in La Liga, one place behind Real, appeared to have frozen.\nFirst, Casemiro was denied by Oblak from close range as Atletico's defense was caught napping in the opening minutes.\nAnd with 15 minutes on the clock, Ramos turned home from under Oblak's nose, despite a suspicion of offside.\nReal was dominating but failed to find a crucial second goal before the interval.\nWhy Madrid is the world's football capital\nFightback\nThat was to prove costly as Atletico returned rejuvenated and should have leveled almost immediately after the interval.\nFernando Torres, who had been anonymous in the first half, was tripped by Pepe inside the penalty area after the Portuguese defender misjudged his challenge.\nGriezmann, so dependable in front of goal for Atletico this season, strode forward to take the kick but his rasping effort crashed against the crossbar before rebounding to safety. That miss may have strangled the life out of a team without the level of character which Atletico boasts -- but Simeone' side refused to give up.\nStefan Savic, the defender, prodded inches wide at the far post as Real failed to clear its lines before Saul sent a fine effort wide of the far post as Atletico continued to threaten.\nReal, so dominant in the first period, was reduced to playing on the break and both Ronaldo and Gareth Bale went close as Atletico pushed up in search of an equalizer. \nThat equalizer eventually arrived 11 minutes from time -- and when it came it was Carrasco who made sure. The winger met Juanfran's delightful cross at the far post and steered the ball past the helpless Keylor Navas.\nThat strike sparked wild scenes of jubilation with Carrasco racing away to celebrate by kissing his girlfriend in the stands while his teammates danced their way up the touchline.\nBuoyed by restoring parity, Atletico moved forward in search of the goal which would prevent the tie from moving into extra time. Carrasco, a constant menace in attack, began to run Real ragged as those in white began to fade in the Milan night.\nRamos, never one to shy away from a tackle, was booked for a rather over enthusiastic foul on Carrasco to deny the Belgian a run on goal as the tie finished level after 90 minutes.\nEnd game\nReal, looking increasingly weary, appeared to be struggling to compete with Atletico's energy levels with Simeone's side dominating the contest. And yet, it was Real which could have moved ahead when Ronaldo was presented with a free header at goal only to fluff his lines.\nBoth teams began to suffer in the final period of extra-time with numerous players struggling with cramp at the end of an exhausting season.\nIn the end it was left to penalties to decide the outcome of the tie and when Juanfran struck a post to leave his side 3-4 behind, it left Atletico at the mercy of Ronaldo.\nRonaldo was made for moments like these. Rarely shy of being at the center of attention, he strode forward confidently before coolly firing the ball into the net. The trademark ripping off of the shirt then followed as he raced towards his jubilant teammates. \nFor Ronaldo, a third Champions League title -- and another chapter in a remarkable career.\n\"The penalties are always a lottery,\" Ronaldo told BT Sport. \"You never know what will happen but our team showed more experience and we showed it by scoring all the penalties. A fantastic night for us.\"", "Why Madrid is world's football capital": "", "Lionel Messi in court over $4.6 million in unpaid taxes": "Prosecutors allege the pair sought to hide the Barcelona forward's earnings in offshore accounts, amounting to the defrauding of the Spanish government to the tune of \u20ac4.1 million ($4.6 million).

Literally.\nIn the constant battle to beat the competition, to help players hit the ball further than ever before, one company has gone to space to develop its latest clubs.\nREAD: Why Jason Day is 'Tiger-esque'\nCobra Puma, the brand favored by the world's fifth-ranked golfer \nRickie Fowler\n, is pioneering materials and technologies tested on the International Space Station, via its partnership with the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS.)\nIts recent King LTD driver even features a \"spaceport\" -- a see-through window on the sole of the club allowing the golfer to view its inner makeup.\nREAD: The world's best par-3 holes \nOther brands are also branching out too. Callaway has teamed up with aerospace giant Boeing to improve the aerodynamics of its XR driver, used by \nMasters champion Danny Willett\n. Others have sought inspiration from the field of automotive design. \nThe battle for supremacy shows no sign of letting up, particularly in Carlsbad -- golf's equivalent of Silicon Valley -- where big names such as Callaway, TaylorMade, Cobra Puma and Titleist are based. \n\"There are a lot of very smart people working and thinking about golf clubs every day,\" Cobra Puma's vice-president of research and development, Tom Olsavsky, told CNN.\n\"It can be very interesting if you go to lunch somewhere outside the building. You have to look around and make sure there are no competitors. \nREAD: How 'brotherly love' fueled Willett's Masters win\n\"We definitely feel like we're in an arms race. We're always challenging ourselves to beat the other guys.\"\nDespite a reported downturn, the golf industry is still worth about $70 billion in the U.S. alone. \nEvery year or so -- and more often for some -- the manufacturers bring out new products boasting extra distance, more \nforgiveness\n (which reduces the effects of a bad contact on the ball), better accuracy and more consistency.\nIn drivers, distance is still the holy grail, followed by forgiveness. Some sacrifice one over the other, some try to do both.\nAs well as developing new materials, manufacturers dream up all manner of gizmos to help the \"story\": moveable weights to alter ball flight; \nadjustable hosels\n to change loft and lie; channels; slots; turbulators; speed crowns; smartpads; pink, white, blue club heads. And those spaceports.\nThe marketing departments go into overdrive. Sexy slogans are crafted. \nObsolete\nCallaway gave us \"Forgiveness Meets Fast\" and \"Built for Outrageous Speed,\" then there's Cobra's \"The Ultimate Distance Machine,\" Titleist's \"Distance Without Compromise,\" PING's \"Faster. Straighter. Longer\" and TaylorMade's \"The Definition of Distance.\"\nNew club, new combination of buzzwords. New price tags. TaylorMade's latest M1 driver came with a recommended retail price of $499, while Callaway's XR was $349, Cobra's King Ltd. and Titleist's 915 D3 were $449 and Ping's G LS Tec was $399.\nREAD: Why Tiger Woods turned down John Daly's beer invitation\nIt's a far cry from even the modern birth of the game's arms race almost four decades ago, when the first steel-headed \"woods\" were introduced.\nIn 1979, golf salesman Gary Adams launched TaylorMade with his original metal wood, dubbed the \"Pittsburgh Persimmon\" in honor of the type of timber long used in traditional woods.\nThe takeover of metal woods was more of a trickle than a torrent -- it wasn't until 1988 that a player using a metal wood won a major, when Curtis Strange lifted the U.S. Open with a TaylorMade Burner driver.\nTwo years later, Ely Callaway -- a former soldier, textiles executive and wine maker -- tapped into the skills of workers from the fading aerospace industry in Carlsbad, California and launched his iconic over-sized Big Bertha metal driver. \nThe race was on. Persimmon would soon be obsolete.\n'Indisputably better'\nHowever, it's not a free-for-all.\nMyriad rules -- laid down by governing bodies the United States Golf Association and the R&A -- are in place to curb technology. \nTo conform, clubs must not exceed 48 inches long, while the head of a driver must not be bigger than 460 cubic centimeters. Plus, there are strict laws that govern the \"spring\" of the face.  \nAlthough there is a whacky world of non-conforming designs out there, the game's big-name manufacturers are working feverishly within these parameters. \n In 1980, when persimmon ruled, the biggest hitter on the PGA Tour was Dan Pohl with an average driving distance of 274.3 yards.  In 2015, 40 players on the PGA Tour recorded an average of more than 300 yards, with the leader Dustin Johnson at 317.7 yards.\n\"The clubs are indisputably better,\" former Golf.com managing editor Eamon Lynch told CNN. \n\"But no one is more willing to believe in the promise of a technologically advanced, store-bought solution than a golfer with a crappy swing.\"\nIncremental\nSo what's next? Manufacturers have differing views on where their focus should be, with moveable weights, face technology, head shape and weight all key battlegrounds.\nMost seem to agree that a club's center of gravity -- which affects launch, spin, feel and ultimately distance -- is the priority in the next few years.\n\"Some companies spend a lot of time talking about aerodynamics but we see that as a very small gain because club heads are already pretty aerodynamic,\" Cobra Puma's Olsavsky says.\nREAD: Musical golfer on Brazil's party people\n\"We believe the trend is low and further-back center gravity (CG). Better use of materials, investing in carbon fiber crowns and improved CG is where the industry is headed.\"\nWhether the gains will be incremental, or whether there will be another big leap forward, depends on your time frame.\n\"If you buy a driver every year, yes, you would see more incremental changes than innovative,\" Olsavsky adds.\n\"If you don't buy a driver very often -- say every four, five or six years -- the change will be pretty revolutionary and you will notice a big difference.\"\nFor the pros used to switching in and out of the best equipment, marginal gains are important.\n\"Callaway only bring products to me when they know it's going to perform better than what I've got at the minute,\" Willett told a Callaway prodcast. \n\"I did  a lot of testing with the XR driver at home over the winter and put it in the bag right away. It did exactly what they said it would for my game. It gave me more ball speed and control of my ball flight and it was a win-win.\"  \n \nREAD: Is the Players Championship really the fifth major?\nNot all amateur golfers are convinced.\n\"If they kept adding an extra five yards every time, we'd all be hitting it 350 yards by now,\" says Ed Light, an eight-handicap golfer from Cranleigh in Surrey, England. \"For the price of a new one these days, I tend to think the money's better invested in good quality lessons.\"\nNick Russell, a member at Surrey's Walton Heath club, added: \"I think technology has helped, but it's not distance I'm looking for as modern clubs and balls all go a long way; it's forgiveness, with a club that sits well and is pleasing to the eye.\n\"I am maybe 10 yards longer now than 10 years ago, probably due to technology, but I arguably swing it a bit better too so it's hard to judge.\"\nREAD: Jordan Spieth's Masters disaster -- the ultimate choke?\nThe elephant in the room in terms of distance is ball technology.\nSimilar amounts of R&D time and money have taken the ball from a hair or feather-filled leather orb to a sleek, dimpled urethane-covered missile.\nBut many, including Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, believe ball development should be reined back to ensure courses are not made obsolete by players hitting longer.\nThe club makers, however, will continue pushing the envelope.

Then Jo-Wilfried Tsonga's leg problem forced the normally ebullient Frenchman to retire from his third-round match in tears. \nThat quartet, arguably, are the four most popular male players in a country that loves its tennis. Maria Sharapova, perhaps the world's highest-profile female athlete, is missing, serving a\n provisional ban for failing a drug tes\nt.   \nAnd the weather has been frightful, taking a chunk out of the romance of Paris in the spring. \nFor the first time in 16 years, rain washed out all of the play at Roland Garros on Monday, with temperatures more suited to late winter than late May. \nOn Tuesday, tournament organizers -- already criticized for being the only grand slam not to have a roof -- received more stinging words from two fan favorites: Simona Halep and Agnieszka Radwanska. No men's matches were completed, and play was canceled shortly before 7 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) once again thanks to Mother Nature. \nMen's No. 1 Novak Djokovic led Roberto Bautista Agut 3-6 6-4 4-1 when play was halted. If the men's semifinals don't switch from their usual Friday slot, he faces the possibility of playing on four straight days heading into the final weekend. \nIt's an unpleasant scenario for a player seeking to win the only grand slam missing from his collection. \nBoth Halep and Radwanska exited the year's second major, which no doubt raised their frustration levels. Halep, the 2014 finalist, accused the powers that be -- in this case the French Tennis Federation and tournament supervisors -- of not caring about the players. \nThe Romanian lost to 2010 runner-up Samantha Stosur 7-6 (7-0) 6-3, while second seed Radwanska fell 2-6 6-3 6-3 to unseeded Tsvetana Pironkova. Both fourth-round matches were contested in, at the very least, a light drizzle. At worst, the rain came down hard. \nClay absorbs moisture better than hard courts and grass courts, so play can still take place when rain falls. But Halep and Radwanska felt conditions were too harsh. \n\"No one cares about the players, in my opinion,\" sixth-ranked Halep told reporters. \"I don't care that I lost the match today. But I was close to getting injured with my back, so that's a big problem. \n\"The court was not good. The balls were wet, completely wet during the match. I think it's too difficult to play tennis in these conditions.\"\nHalep and Radwanska led their encounters prior to the resumption. On Sunday, Halep held a 5-3 advantage, and Radwanska was in an even better position, at 6-2 3-0. \nThe Pole, now out of contention for the $2.3 million first prize, needed treatment to her hand Tuesday. \n\"I'm just so surprised and angry, that, you know, we have to play in the rain,\" Radwanska told reporters. \"I mean, it's not a $10,000 tournament. It's a grand slam. How can you allow players to play in the rain? I cannot play in those conditions. \n\"The second set -- we played pretty much in the rain. I don't think they really care what we think. I think they care about other things, I guess.\n\"So, well, I'm just p***ed.\"\nTheir views harkened memories of the 2011 U.S. Open, when Nadal and Andy Murray criticized officials for forcing them to play on wet hard-courts. \nPironkova, a former Wimbledon semifinalist now ranked 102nd, said she just got on with it. \n\"We have played in all sorts of conditions,\" the Bulgarian told reporters. \"Usually if the court is not fit for play, like if it's slippery, they would cancel the match right away.\n\"But today the court was still hanging in, it was okay, we could have played, and so we did.\"\nStosur, who plays Pironkova next, said the delays -- and likelihood of more bad weather -- meant players needed to take every opportunity to be on court.\n\"If the umpire says we're stopping, we're stopping. I don't know what the forecast is,\" the Australian said.\n\"I know what it feels like out there and I know it was raining for the first time we went out today, but the court was okay for the most part.\n\"I don't think Simona was complaining about it. Again we're told to play, we play. If it gets too wet you've got to say something. Yeah, like it's not good out there, but it was fine for us.\"\nFrench Open tournament director Guy Forget didn't immediately reply when contacted by CNN for his reaction. \nSlow start for Djokovic\nDjokovic is sure to speak about the situation when his match ends against Bautista Agut. \nDue to start on center court at 11 a.m., they began at 12:10. \nLooking unfocused -- maybe pondering his now much more difficult path to a maiden title at the French Open -- Djokovic dropped the first set. \nReturning from another rain delay, his mood lightened. The Serb borrowed an umbrella from a fan in the stands prior to offering a brief dance on court. \nHis level escalated, even if his luck didn't. It's rare for players to break a string in a match, but Djokovic broke two in the same game attempting to serve out the second. \nTomas Berdych, David Ferrer, Dominic Thiem, Marcel Granollers, David Goffin and Ernests Gulbis are also in the top half of the draw. Thiem and Granollers split two sets; Gulbis led Goffin 3-0 in their opener; and Ferrer was 2-1 up over Berdych in their first. \nWith the rain falling, Thiem, who boasts the most wins on clay in 2016, seemed to stop play by himself at 5-2 in the first, not waiting for the umpire to call off proceedings. \nMurray's last-eight clash with France's remaining singles player, Richard Gasquet, was pushed back to Wednesday along with defending champion Stan Wawrinka's match with maiden grand slam quarterfinalist Albert Ramos-Vinolas. \nAmong women's matches canceled, for the second straight day, was defending champion Serena Williams' fourth-round meeting with Elina Svitolina. \nOrganizers, fans and players can only hope for a reversal of the weather fortunes. \nCan Djokovic overcome the odds and win the French Open this year?

What happens with 18-hole playoffs?' \n\"So I had some weird things going in my head but somehow managed to hit a great putt. And then the next 10 minutes were kind of crazy.\"\nBehind him, Mickelson had stood on the 18th tee with a one-shot lead. A par four on the last would have been enough to win his third major in a row after victory in April's Masters and the U.S. PGA the previous summer. \nBut amid a feverish throng, Mickelson blew it spectacularly -- first with a drive that sliced way left into a hospitality unit before settling in rough behind trees.\n \nIn traditional swashbuckling fashion, he tried to go for the green from the rough but could only hack out 25 yards. His third shot found the greenside bunker, and his fourth splashed over the green before he chipped on and holed a putt for a six to lose by one. \n'Bittersweet'\nTo rub salt into the wound, Mickelson had to return to the 18th green for the presentation ceremony.\n\"It was really bittersweet with Phil on the last green because ... he was at a pretty low point for the next 20 minutes after the 18th hole and kind of head spinning,\" added Ogilvy, who defended his title at Oakmont, Pennsylvania, the following year. \n\"I'm friends with Phil so that was a kind of an odd moment to try to not be too gleeful in front of him and his situation but I was pretty excited. And then the next few hours were just a complete blur.\"\nCountryman Adam Scott even got off Ernie Els's departing private jet and hared back to Winged Foot to join in the celebrations. \n \nPoignant\nFor Mickelson, it was a fourth runner-up spot in a tournament he so desperately wanted to win. \nHis first big U.S. Open disappointment came at Pinehurst, North Carolina, in 1999, when he was pipped by Payne Stewart, who died four months later in a plane crash. In 2002 he had to settle for second behind Tiger Woods at Bethpage Black on Long Island. \nIn 2004, with a first major finally under his belt with victory at that year's Masters, he lost out to Retief Goosen in the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, also in front of an adoring New York crowd. \nAnd back at Bethpage in 2009 -- and with the narrative given extra poignancy after wife Amy had been diagnosed with breast cancer -- Mickelson finished second behind journeyman Lucas Glover.\n'Motivated by failure'\nBut Mickelson insists the hardest pill to swallow was losing out to England's Justin Rose at Merion in 2013.\n\"I do. That hasn't changed,\" he said ahead of last year's U.S. Open at Chambers Bay. \"It was a tournament I feel I should have won, that I was playing well enough to win. And a couple of mistakes late in the tournament ended up costing me. \n\"Not to take anything away from Justin -- he played a phenomenal final round -- but I felt like I didn't have to play exceptional to shoot a lower score than that and I just didn't do it.\"\nWith such a medley of misses behind him, each successive U.S. Open piles extra pressure on Mickelson.\nOnly two players have won a modern major over the age of 46 -- Julius Boros was 48 when he won the 1968 U.S. PGA and Nicklaus was 46 when he clinched the last of his 18 major titles at the 1986 Masters. \nMickelson, however, is still motivated by the challenge. \n\"I've always been somebody, ever since I was a kid, who got motivated by failure,\" the current world No. 18 told reporters last year.\n\"Some people get discouraged by that, and it almost pushes them away. But for me it's been a motivator to continue to work harder and get over that hump.\"\nHe added: \"I'm enjoying that challenge. I'm having fun with it. It's not a burden. It's like an exciting opportunity. And every year it comes around, I get excited to try to conquer that opportunity and complete that grand slam.

Wimbledon and the Australian Open have covered courts -- the latter boasts three -- and the \nU.S. Open follows suit for the first time at this year's event\n starting in August. \nLast week, French Open tournament director Guy Forget said the earliest a roof can be installed at the venue is 2020, not in 2018 as originally planned. \"In other countries, things are quicker,\" he said. \nResidents in the area in southwest Paris -- close to the Bois de Boulogne park -- and environmental groups oppose an extension of the site that would also include a roof and have taken legal action. \nForget spoke to reporters again Monday in the main interview room and appeared more exasperated than last week. \nIt countered his light-hearted demeanor Sunday, when a television segment aired on Eurosport in which Forget and American analyst John McEnroe pretended to call politicians in France and the U.S. to speed up building of the roof. \n\"I'm coming to express my frustration,\" Forget said, referring to the weather and lack of a roof at Roland Garros. \n\"I am a bit annoyed. It's hard.\n\"For those in our country who are still doubting the necessity to expand, to modernize our stadium, I think right now, the fact, there is proof that it's a necessity and we have to do it.\"\nFrance's former Davis Cup captain added that it's time \"to say stop\" and simply make the project happen. \n\"We have talked about that roof in Paris 15 years ago already,\" said Forget, in his first year in the job. \nUnfortunately for Forget, players and fans alike, the forecast doesn't look great in the coming days. \nRain is predicted for at least two of the next three days.

For one thing, the Cavs reloaded their bench with savvy veterans, while replacing coach David Blatt mid-season. And in contrast to last year's finals when All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down with injuries, they're operating at full strength this time. \nMeanwhile, Golden State proved last year's championship was no fluke by plowing through the regular season with a never-done-before 73 wins. Stephen Curry connected beyond the arc at a record-setting pace, while combining with teammate Klay Thompson for 678 three-pointers -- more than any other \nteam\n in NBA history. \nWhich city will earn the right to parade the Larry O'Brien Trophy depends upon a number of key factors -- all of which will play out over the next two weeks. \nWhose Big Three will be more effective? \nBasketball fans were deprived of this potentially epic duel last season, when Love, a three-point and rebounding ace, was lost to a separated shoulder, while scoring machine Irving suffered a knee injury at the end of Game 1. \nBoth are back, and will be pitted with James -- who has quietly lost the mantle of the popular choice of the league's best player -- against Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green. The two sets of All-Stars bring very different skills to the table. (Irving has evolved into a classic drive and dish point guard, for example, while the Warriors rely on cross-court passing and isolation sets.) At 31 and competing in his seventh finals (and sixth in a row), James is the elder-statesman of the group.  \nREAD: James Goldstein - How a fashion cowboy seduced the NBA\n  \nWhich Warriors team will show up? \nGolden State live and die by the three, and at times can go cold. Curry and Thompson combined to shoot just 11 of 41 from beyond the arc in Games 3 and 4 against the Thunder, both losses, and managed to stave off a combined 5 of 17 effort in Game 5. Then Thompson got hot (11 threes in Game 6, a playoff record) and the face of the series changed. \nCan Draymond Green stay on the court? \nGreen, the vocal leader of the Warriors, is only one flagrant foul or two technicals away from a one-game suspension. Given that he was perilously close to garnering a suspension in the conference finals, Green will have to curb his enthusiasm (and flailing legs) if he's to remain on the court.    \nWhich coach will win the battle of the adjustments? \nSteve Kerr now has two full seasons under his belt as an NBA head coach -- which sounds exceptionally low until you consider that his opponent Tyronn Lue has less than five months of experience at the helm.\nNBA Finals often come down to critical coaching adjustments that swing the momentum of a series. Down 2-1 in last year's finals, Kerr took the advice of a Warriors' video coordinator and inserted Andre Iguodala -- the only defender with the ability to slow down James -- into the starting lineup. The Cavs would not win another game in the series, and Iguodala was named finals MVP.\nThe shorthanded David Blatt, meanwhile, was unable to make significant adjustments of his own, rendering a triple teamed LeBron ineffective. \nKerr pulled the same move again in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, starting Iguodala against Kevin Durant, which may prompt him to leave the 6-foot 6-inch swingman in for the finals. \nLue may consider giving more minutes to Iman Shumpurt, a solid defender with rested legs to match up against the \"Splash Brothers.\"\nREAD: What if the Warriors lose? Eight great teams destiny left behind\nWhich role players will emerge from each team?\nBefore \nIguodala took over the finals\n, last year's surprise was a little-known Aussie-turned-sensation named Matthew Dellavedova, who harassed Curry into a dreadful 4 of 21 three-point shooting slump in Games 1 and 2, while providing clutch scoring in the absence of Irving.\nDelly will be in the Cavs' mix again in this series, though teammates J.R. Smith (46% three-point shooting in the playoffs) and Channing Frye (a blistering 58% three-point shooting in the playoffs) are better positioned to make an impact.\nGolden State will lean on backup point guard, 6-foot 7-inch Shaun Livingston, to help out on defense and scoring, while oversized scorer Marreese Speights can heat up in a hurry. The 6-foot 10-inch perimeter shooter known as \"Mo' Buckets\" has already notched five double-figure games in the playoffs, including a 22-point outburst against Houston in the first round.\nCan Cleveland avoid the same mistakes that plagued Oklahoma City?\nAside from rest, one benefit to the Cavs closing out their conference finals early was the ability to watch the Thunder meltdown against the Warriors. Cleveland will want to avoid the same pitfalls that ensnared Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant -- namely trying to go toe-to-toe in a shooting competition with Curry and Thompson.  \nAlthough the Cavs can also shoot the trey -- breaking an NBA record with 25 three-pointers made in one game against the Hawks in their second round playoff series -- they're not the Warriors. \nWith a commanding 3-1 lead in the series, Durant and Westbrook abandoned the ball movement that gave them the upper hand and began chucking quick shots that clanked off the rim, back into the hands of their red hot opponents. \nFollowing a disciplined start where the duo made 35% of their 38 three-point attempts in Games 1 to 4, Durant and Westbrook shot only 27% of their 45 attempts in Games 5 to 7. Game 6, however, was when the wheels fell off. Enjoying a 13 point home lead early in the game and seemingly cruising into the finals, the Thunder wound up shooting 3 for 23 from beyond the arc and losing by 7. \nDown 104-101 with 1.35 on the clock, Durant -- who was 1 for 7 from three-point range at that point -- heaved a rushed three which clanked into the hands of Thompson. Westbrook finished 0 for 5 from long distance. \nCan Golden State protect its home court advantage? \nThis could prove to be the difference-maker of the finals. The Warriors lost only three times at home all season, including the shocking Game 1 defeat to OKC at the start of the last series. \nThe Cavs, meanwhile, lost eight times in Cleveland, but have gone 7-0 at the Quicken Loans Arena this post season. Taking advantage of a winded Warriors team by stealing at least one of the first two games in Oakland will be the goal of the Cavs -- a feat they achieved in last year's finals but couldn't take advantage of. \nPrediction: Cavaliers win in six games, to deliver Cleveland's first pro championship since 1964\nLast year James played a very un-LeBron-like finals without the offensive support of Love and Irving. Tasked with everything from bringing the ball up the court to calling isolation plays for himself, James will happily defer to Irving and focus on the intangibles necessary to grit out wins. \nAs mentioned in CNN's preseason preview,\n it took LeBron two years to bring a championship to Miami, and he's on course to repeat that feat in his second go-around in Cleveland.\nWho've you got?

One big circus.\" \nHe felt the conditions had been the same throughout the match, so wondered why they departed at that stage. Earlier this week, Simona Halep and Agnieszka Radwanska complained bitterly after being made to play in the rain. \nDjokovic, meanwhile, admitted he was \"lucky\" to still be on the court and continuing his bid to win the only grand slam missing from his collection.\nBouncing his racket in frustration at 0-1 in the same set, it spun backwards near the court's backboard and the linesperson reacted quickly to move out of the way. If he hadn't, Djokovic would have faced disqualification. \nRead: Tennis' first $100M player\nAsked if he realized how close he came to striking the official, the Serb replied: \"It's obvious what I tried to do. I don't understand your question. I threw a racket on the ground and it slipped and almost hit the line umpire. I was lucky there. \n\"I'm just not thinking about those kinds of situations,\" he later added. \n\"I am aware that I have been lucky, and I apologized to people that have been in this particular situation with me and that could have been hurt by my racket. But it was never the intention. It was just some unfortunate bounce, but fortunate ending of that scenario.\"\nDefending champion Williams also overcame the dreadful spring weather and her spirited opponent Yulia Putintseva 5-7 6-4 6-1 to move within two matches of becoming the joint winningest player in grand slams in the Open Era. \nRead: Women's stars criticize organizers\nShowers, at times heavy, pelted the City of Lights and temperatures struggled to reach 16C (61F). Factoring in a biting wind that had Williams draping herself in tournament towels and men's semifinalist Dominic Thiem donning a windbreaker during changeovers, not even the sight of the Eiffel Tower would have made this a pleasant day. \nWell, that's debatable. \nWhat isn't is the number of grand slams Williams possesses: 21. A win Saturday and the American ties Steffi Graf for top position in the Open Era. \nThe 34-year-old remains the strong favorite, although her aura of invincibility waned in upset losses at the U.S. Open and Australian Open -- and might have lessened further Thursday. Something, perhaps, for her surprising semifinal opponent, 58th-ranked Kiki Bertens, to feed off. \nREAD: Kerber stuns Williams\nBertens ousted last year's semifinalist Timea Bacsinszky 7-5 6-2 for a 12th straight win, including qualifying, in the past two weeks. Not since Betty Stove at the 1977 U.S. Open had a Dutch woman made a grand slam semifinal. \nIn recent days, players who possess more power generally have had the advantage in the cool, heavy conditions, yet Williams' radar was off for much of the first two sets against her 5-foot-4-inch foe as the pair followed Djokovic on Philippe Chatrier court. \nA permanent scowl seems embedded on the face of the 60th-ranked Putintseva, a former junior No. 2 who spent significant time at the academy run by Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou. \nShe played smart, clean tennis in the first set of her debut grand slam quarterfinal, allowing Williams to implode -- 24 unforced errors sailed and thumped off the racket of the world No. 1, compared to two for Putintseva. \nWhen Williams led 4-1 in the second, their previous two encounters sprung to mind. On both occasions, Putintseva faded after a tight first set. \nWilliams, however, relinquished the advantage and needed to save two break points at 4-4. On the second, given another chance thanks to a kind net cord, Putintseva sent a backhand long. \nWilliams converted her second set point in the ensuing game courtesy of a Putintseva double fault. The third became a blowout, despite Putintseva forcing Williams to work hard in the final game. \nBreezing through the first four rounds, Williams' display was more like her path 12 months ago when she took part in five three-setters en route to the title. \n\"Yulia played unbelievable,\" Williams told the crowd, using a white towel provided by interviewer Marion Bartoli as a blanket. \n\"I honestly didn't think I was going to win that in the second set.\"\nWilliams showed up for her mandatory post-match press conference about two hours late, which raised alarm bells. She said she wasn't injured but took only seven questions before the short briefing ended at her request. \nWhen Williams played Bertens in the first round at the U.S. Open last year, the latter led by a break, eventually succumbing 7-6 (7-5) 6-3. \nControversy\nDjokovic reached his 30th grand slam semifinal by dispatching Berdych, setting up a last-four meeting with Thiem and once again enlisting the help of a ball-boy to salute the crowd in celebration. \nBaby-faced, yet a ball crusher, Thiem's comeback 4-6 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 6-1 win over pal David Goffin meant the 22-year-old became the third Austrian man to land in a grand slam semifinal after left-handers Thomas Muster and Jurgen Melzer. \nDjokovic, like Thiem, will be playing for a fourth straight day Friday thanks to the rain. \nPrior to his racket-throwing incident, Djokovic played his best tennis of the tournament in winning seven straight games from 2-3 in the first to 3-0 in the second. He improved his record against the seventh seed to 24-2. \nThiem, whose powerful game resembles that of defending champion Stan Wawrinka, will move into the top 10 next week. \nIn their first grand slam quarterfinal, the second set proved pivotal between Thiem and the 13th-ranked Goffin. \nGoffin failed to serve out the second set and Thiem subsequently led 5-2 and 6-5 in the tiebreak. Goffin stormed back to 7-6 to earn a set point but Thiem won three straight points.  \n\"In the whole second set I really didn't think that I'm going to win this match, because he was just on top of me,\" Thiem told reporters. \"He was the better player the first two sets maybe, or until the tiebreak.\"\nThey played continuously, without stoppages, unlike both matches on center court. \nThiem spent 45 more minutes on court than Djokovic and had a long week in Nice prior to the French, winning the title. He said, though, he was in \"good shape.\" \nDjokovic leads their young rivalry 2-0 but Thiem manufactured 15 break points in two sets when they played at the Miami Open in March. \n\"It's going to be unbelievably tough,\" Thiem said. \"I think he's a little bit on a different level than all the other players, but I'm still in good shape and the match starts at 0-0.\"\nWawrinka and second-seed Murray contest the other men's semifinal. Samantha Stosur, the 2010 French Open finalist, plays last year's Wimbledon finalist Garbine Muguruza in the other women's semifinal. \nAs for the rain, yes, some of it is expected Friday.

Whoever gets it less wrong is going to win.\"\nRyan believes his players will be able to cope -- they have to deal with daily exposure and expectation back home in Fiji.\n\"It's every training session, every day the newspaper front and back page, and every time on the six o'clock news -- so that sort of pressure they are used to,\" he says.\n\"After the first world series win, on the drive from the airport mums were putting babies on the road to stop the cars. We had to get out, say hello, take a photograph.\"\nDespite Fiji's great depth in talent, and his desire to keep a consistent team together, Ryan has not been afraid to bring in overseas-based players to \"keep stirring the pot\" and maintain competition for places.\nHe raised the bar again by recruiting former Australian rugby league star Jarryd Hayne, \nwho ended his high-profile stint with NFL team San Francisco 49ers to take a chance on his Olympic dream.\nIn southern hemisphere sporting context, Hayne is box-office gold  -- and was the focus of media attention when he made his Fiji debut at the season-ending London Sevens last weekend.\nRead: Kenya breaks record; Fiji seals series title\nRyan says the 28-year-old -- a dual passport-holder who represented the \"Bati\" at 2008's Rugby League World Cup -- is up for the challenge.\n\"He made a massive gamble in leaving behind the huge pay checks that were being offered to him in rugby league to turn his hand to the NFL,\" Ryan adds. \n\"He made an impact, he ran like a rugby player and beat people and handed off. \n\"I can't even begin to imagine how hard it is to learn those playbooks they have to learn -- my philosophy is everything we do on the field should fit on one A4 sheet. \n\"Jarryd had pieces of paper stashed down his trunks so he could remember the plays, because it's such a highly-structured game.  It also shows how willing he was to invest in that, and he's doing the same with us.\"\nDespite his star status, Hayne -- whose father Manoa Thompson is a former Fiji rugby league international, and well known to Ryan -- is not guaranteed an Olympic place.\nHe will compete with 23 other hopefuls in an intense seven-week camp which will end with the final 12-man squad.\n\"Our cupboard is not just deep, it's littered with fantastic talent,\" Ryan told CNN at Twickenham on Sunday, where an experimental Fiji side finished fourth. \nREAD: Scots' shock win gives rugby minnows hope of Olympic glory\n\"He's got to do a huge amount, the competition's high.

He also was hospitalized in December 2014 with pneumonia.\nIn recent years, Ali has largely stayed out of the limelight. But he once was known not only for his athletic prowess as a boxer but also for his social activism.\nAli was born as Cassius Clay and in 1960 won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight. In 1964, he defeated Sonny Liston by KO in the seventh round and became the World Heavyweight Champion. It was also the year he converted and joined the Nation of Islam, changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali.\nIn April 1967, as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War, Ali refused induction into the U.S. Army. The World Boxing Association then stripped him of his world title. On June 20, 1967, Ali was convicted in federal court of violating Selective Service laws and sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000. He stayed out of prison as his case was appealed.\nIn 1990, Ali met with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad to attempt to negotiate the release of Americans held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait. Additionally, in 2011, Ali publicly appealed to Iranian officials for the release of captive hikers Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal.\nOne of the most powerful images of Ali came in 1996, when he lit the torch at the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.\nIn 2005, Ali was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W.

But look closely, and you can find long garbage trails of debris flowing through the areas where Olympic teams are training before the games. \nThe flotsam includes chunks of wood, rubber sandals, sneakers, and of course, plastic bags. \nBut this isn't the kind of pollution that the athletes are worried about.\nOne of Jurczok and Lorenz's teammates had to have emergency surgery after a race in Rio last summer, when small cuts on his legs became horribly infected.\nDumping ground for waste\nFor all its beauty, the sea here has also been a dumping ground of raw sewage washing down out of the Olympic host city. The horribly polluted waters are an environmental hazard that the city has struggled with for decades.\nBrazilian authorities insist the bay will be safe for the sailors.\nEduardo Paes, the mayor of Rio, told CNN that the Games will be held during the time of year when there is less rain, and thus less effluent pouring into the sea.\nHe spoke to CNN last week at the launch of a brand new sewage treatment plant. It would provide several hundred thousand residents of Rio with modern treatment of their waste for the very first time.\nBut there are many, many more Brazilians living in the surrounding metropolitan area, who do not have sewage treatment.\n\"The twelve cities that are around Guanabara and the state level have missed the opportunity to solve a problem,\" Paes conceded.\nThe worst of the pollution is immediately noticeable at points where urban canals spill out into the bay.\nAt one such location, the air is thick and toxic with the stench of raw sewage. Dark black clumps of debris float on the water's surface. \nFisherman Filipe Fernandes has to slow down his small motorboat to protect the propeller from all the garbage floating in the water.  Still, it doesn't take long before a plastic bag snarls and stalls the propeller.\n\"It's impossible to swim here,\" Fernandes says, after he uses a long metal hook to rip the plastic bag off his propeller.  \"You'll get all sorts of sicknesses. Skin diseases. Hepatitis. And of course you can't fish here.\"\nAnother fisherman named Reinaldo Coelho moors his boat here in the Fundao Canal, a stone's throw from where grey liquid spills out of a large concrete pipe directly into the water.\n\"It comes from the houses,\" Coelho says. \"There is no basic sewage.  Look at Rio now, we are going to have the Olympics, but we don't have a basic sewage system. There's no logic.\"\nSigns of improvement\nAccording to a May 26 statement by World Sailing, the governing body for the sport, the water quality is \"noticeably better\" in launch areas around one of Rio's main marinas. \n\"The trend lines are encouraging,\" announced the group's CEO Andy Hunt, after holding meetings with city officials and environmental experts. \"But it will be important that not a single day is lost in implementing the remaining measures that are planned, including the installation of a series of new eco barriers.\"\nThe two German sailors Jurczok and Lorenz say they try not to focus on the water pollution.\nThey will both be competing for the first time in the Olympics in August. It will also be the first time women will compete in the 49er FX class of sailboat. \nWhen they catch a strong gust of wind, the two sailors hike their bodies out over the water, attached to the mast of their 49er FX by long harnesses fixed to their waists. At these moments, the light-weight craft almost looks like a two-person windsurfer.\nTheir team has medical doctors on stand-by in the event of any complications due to the water.\nAs far as other precautions go, they say they try to avoid swimming and try to keep the water from getting into their mouths.\nAfter each training day, Lorenz says, \"we wash all our neoprene clothes in special washing liquid, so we can ensure that all the bacteria is out.\"", "Why tennis stars love Roland Garros": "", "Pele to auction $5M personal items": "Brazil soccer legend Pele is auctioning off several items from his glittering career, including his replica of the famous Jules Rimet trophy.\nMore than 60 years after first signing as a professional footballer, Pele has put everything up for sale, from his World Cup winner's medals to the football boots he wore during the movie Escape to Victory, which also starred Sylvester Stallone and English football hero Sir Bobby Moore.\n\"It was a difficult decision to make but it takes a lot to properly care for these artefacts,\" said Pele, who was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento.\n\"I felt I could do much more good by sharing these items with the world, as well as helping the causes that are important to me.\"\nThe most valuable item up for sale is Pele's replica of the Jules Rimet trophy, which was presented to him after winning a third World Cup with Brazil in 1970.\nJulien's Auction House in London has been charged with selling the items over the course of three days and values the trophy at $600,000, while each of Pele's winner's medals are expected to sell for $200,000 each.\nAdditional highlights include worn shirts from Pele's time with Santos and the New York Cosmos ($10,000 each), a New York Cosmos NASL championship ring ($40,000) and the boots worn in 1981 World War Two film Escape to Victory ($8,000).\nOver 2,000 items are to be sold with a conservative estimate on the entire collection set at $5.1 million.\n\"Having donated a significant portion of my collection to the City of Santos, I have decided to allow fans and collectors to own a piece of my history as well,\" added Pele, who holds the Guinness World Record of 1,283 for total career goals scored. \n\"I hope they treasure these artefacts and share my story with their children and generations to come. \n\"I will also be donating a portion of the proceeds from the auction to Pequeno Principe (Little Prince), the largest paediatric hospital in Brazil.\"\nNow 75, Pele has himself spent much of the last year in hospital, undergoing prostate, back and hip surgery.\nThe auction runs from June 7-9 and will be live online, allowing prospective buyers from all over the world to participate.", "Washout focuses criticism on lack of roof at Roland Garros": "An already weather-affected Roland Garros hit a low Monday when rain washed out all of the play for the first time in exactly 16 years. Concurrently, it made Novak Djokovic's task of completing his grand slam collection a little bit harder. \nWhile organizers, who canceled play early at about 1:45 p.m. local time (11:45 GMT), can't control Mother Nature, they are sure to receive more criticism for being the only grand slam in tennis not to have a roof. Wimbledon and the Australian Open have covered courts -- the latter boasts three -- and the \nU.S. Open follows suit for the first time at this year's event\n starting in August. \nLast week, French Open tournament director Guy Forget said the earliest a roof can be installed at the venue is 2020, not in 2018 as originally planned. \"In other countries, things are quicker,\" he said. \nResidents in the area in southwest Paris -- close to the Bois de Boulogne park -- and environmental groups oppose an extension of the site that would also include a roof and have taken legal action. \nForget spoke to reporters again Monday in the main interview room and appeared more exasperated than last week. \nIt countered his light-hearted demeanor Sunday, when a television segment aired on Eurosport in which Forget and American analyst John McEnroe pretended to call politicians in France and the U.S. to speed up building of the roof. \n\"I'm coming to express my frustration,\" Forget said, referring to the weather and lack of a roof at Roland Garros. \n\"I am a bit annoyed. It's hard.\n\"For those in our country who are still doubting the necessity to expand, to modernize our stadium, I think right now, the fact, there is proof that it's a necessity and we have to do it.\"\nFrance's former Davis Cup captain added that it's time \"to say stop\" and simply make the project happen. \n\"We have talked about that roof in Paris 15 years ago already,\" said Forget, in his first year in the job. \nUnfortunately for Forget, players and fans alike, the forecast doesn't look great in the coming days. \nRain is predicted for at least two of the next three days. Hence a Monday men's final may be in the works. Forget didn't rule it out but hoped the event would conclude as planned Sunday. \nPrecipitation -- no, not snow, even if temperatures were chilly -- was a feature of week one. \nWorld No. 1 Djokovic\n -- due to meet Roberto Bautista Agut -- and other players in the top half of the men's draw now face the prospect of playing Tuesday and then Wednesday, not getting a day off between matches, which is the norm at grand slams. \nDjokovic is scheduled to begin his match at 11 a.m. local time Tuesday and singles action is planned for four courts as officials attempt to play catchup. Normally at this stage, singles play is reserved for the two biggest courts, Philippe Chatrier and Suzanne Lenglen. \nMORE: Injured Nadal withdraws from French Open\nPlaying on consecutive days last year at the tournament might have affected the Serb. He needed to take to the court on two straight days to finish off his semifinal against Andy Murray, leaving him without a day off ahead of the final against Stan Wawrinka -- who then won in four sets. \nLike Murray, Wawrinka sits in the bottom half and they have already completed their fourth-round tussles. \nDjokovic criticized the tournament Saturday for not having lights, following his third-round win over Britain's Aljaz Bedene.  \n\"I just hope that soon Roland Garros will at least have lights ... at least on the center court and Suzanne Lenglen,\" Djokovic, who will become the first tennis player to pass $100 million in prize money if he reaches the quarterfinals, told reporters. \"I mean, for a grand slam you need to have lights. \n\"I'm really hoping we can have that very soon for these particular situations, especially considering the fact that the forecast for weather is not that great in the following days.\n\"So it's not good for anybody, you know, waiting the whole day, for players, for fans, for tournament organizers. I'm just hoping that things will go well in the future.\"\nWomen's fourth-round matches were all due to be completed Monday, too. \nSerena Williams, chasing a record-tying 22nd grand slam in the Open Era, thus didn't take to the court against Elina Svitolina.

An Associated Press photograph of the terrified child, cowering as an officer in riot gear points an assault rifle at him, inflamed passions even more. \nRioting broke out in Miami as many in the Cuban-American community reacted angrily to the seizure of the boy.\nElian was reunited with his father and following more court proceedings -- ending with the Supreme Court rejecting the Miami relatives' efforts to get him back -- father and son flew home to Cuba. \nA massive 'welcome home' demonstration\nThere the government celebrated Elian's return with a massive demonstration. \nFrom then on, Elian Gonzalez was surrounded by government bodyguards. He said later that they became some of his best friends during his childhood.\nGonzalez's father, a waiter who had received invitations to defect while in the United States, was appointed to the island's National Assembly.\nDespite the promises he would return to his old life, Elian Gonzalez never stayed out of the public spotlight too long.\nAt his seventh birthday party, the guest of honor was Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Images of Elian and Castro celebrating were first shown on the island's state-run TV and then transmitted around the world, to a public still fascinated by the case of the rafter-boy.\n\"Fidel Castro for me is like a father,\" Gonzalez said in an interview with Cuba's state-run media in 2013. \"I don't profess to have any religion, but if I did my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path.\" \n'I saw the monster from the inside'\nIn another 2013 interview, Gonzalez said he remembers little of the disastrous journey to the U.S. or the tense months living with relatives in Miami's Little Havana while lawyers and government officials argued over his future. \nHis mother was \"manipulated\" by her boyfriend to leave Cuba, he said, and if he had stayed in Miami, he would have been forced to become \"a performer\" for the media.\n\"I saw the monster from the inside,\" he said, quoting Cuba's revolutionary poet Jose Marti. \nThat same year, Gonzalez took his first trip outside of Cuba since his return from the United States, traveling to Ecuador for a youth conference.\nDuring the conference, Gonzalez blasted U.S. policies that he said encouraged Cubans like his mother to make the dangerous journey by sea to Florida.\n\"Just like her, many others have died attempting to go to the United States. But it's the U.S. government's fault,\" he told CNN in an interview. \"Their unjust embargo provokes an internal and critical economic situation in Cuba.\" \n'The youngest of our heroes'\nLast December, Gonzalez was one of the guests of honor at \nthe government celebration\n to mark the return of three Cuban intelligence agents who were freed as part of the historic thawing of relations between the U.S. and Cuba.\n\"We are proud of him, as the youngest of our heroes,\" Cuban President Raul Castro said during the ceremony, gesturing to Gonzalez in the audience, as he recounted the young man's achievements in school the way a proud father would.\nSpeaking to ABC News in May, Gonzalez said he would like to visit the United States again one day to thank the people who supported his return to Cuba.\n\"To the American people, first I say thank you for the love they give me,\" Gonzalez said. \"I want the time to give my love to American people.\"\nBut Gonzalez remains a strident revolutionary.  \nIn May, he was elected to the leadership of his local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, the neighborhood watch groups that act as the front-line eyes and ears of the Cuban government. In recent years participation in the committees has dwindled, particularly among the young, who seem less interested in the 59-year-old revolution than their parents and grandparents are.\n\"It's a mistake to say that young people are 'lost,'\" Gonzalez said in the interview with Granma in June. \"Young people aren't the future, we are the present.\"", "Nick Menza, ex-Megadeth drummer, dies after collapsing on stage": "Menza was into the third song with his new band Ohm when he collapsed late Saturday night, said Ohm's manager Steve Bauer. Paramedics couldn't revive him. \nThe band was playing at \nThe Baked Potato\n, in Studio City, California. \n\"The group's bassist texted me last night after it happened,\" Bauer told CNN. \"We are all still in shock.\"\nOfficials haven't released a cause of death. \nAlongside Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax, Megadeth makes up metal's \"Big Four.\" And for nine years in the early 1990s, Menza played on the band's biggest releases: \"Rust in Peace,\" \"Countdown to Extinction,\" and \"Youthanasia.\"\nHe joined Ohm last year\n after Ohm lost its then-drummer David Eagle to heart complications. The band also includes former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland. \n\"Tell me this isn't true,\" Megadeth's frontman Dave Mustaine tweeted. \nEx-Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman called Menza a \"great and unique drummer\" who was also \"a trustworthy friend, a hilarious bandmate, as well as a very loving dad.\"", "'Chewbacca Mom' carpools with James Corden, J.J. Abrams": "Why's that, exactly? It's not \nthe millions of views on her Facebook video\n. It's not the attention she's gotten from just about every media outlet, big and small, since posting the video. It's landing a seat in James Corden's car.\nWe all know that late show host James Corden has some trouble getting himself to work, and frequently enlists the help of stars such as \nElton John\n or \nOne Direction\n. \nChewbacca Mom, whose real name is Candace Payne, offers to help Corden out \nBut this isn't the usual \"Carpool Karaoke.\" There's no singing and a lot of laughing.\nPayne is too distracted by her mask, laughing through the now-classic line, \"I'm such a happy Chewbacca!\"\n\"You know that doesn't sound anything like Chewbacca right?\" Corden asks in faux-exasperation. \nAnd the camera cuts to \"Star Wars\" director J.J. Abrams who disagrees.\n\"Can I give you one director's note?\" Abrams asks Payne, and shows her the \nproper\n way to imitate Chewbacca.\nThere are sadly no Chewbacca-inspired songs in the segment, but Corden does eventually find a mask, and the unlikely trio ends on that same laugh we've all come to love.", "Celebrating Octavia Butler's legacy": "Butler featured people of color in battles for control against aliens and hybrid species, opening a world of possibilities to readers who had been excluded from the genre. Her work helped define the literary cornerstone of Afrofuturism, then an emerging movement that draws from science fiction and fantasy with a socially conscious bend.\nBy the time she \ndied\n of a stroke at age 58 in 2006, Butler had amassed international acclaim among fans of speculative fiction, a combination of science fiction, fantasy and horror.\nHer fan base continues to grow as a new generation discovers her 12 novels and short stories, most of which take place in Southern California, where Butler lived for most of her life. Political and social justice activists in particular are taking an interest in her work for the way it intertwines themes of racism, misogyny and class struggles with alien abduction, time travel and parallel universes.\nDespite her accomplishments, fans say, she has yet to receive due credit from her hometown or mainstream literary circles. They hope to change that with a series of events this year in greater Los Angeles marking the 10th anniversary of Butler's death.\n'Steering humankind in a better direction' \nLos Angeles arts organization \nClockshop\n is the driving force behind \nRadio Imagination\n, an ongoing program of cultural events honoring Butler's legacy in partnership with institutions throughout Los Angeles. Named for a \nphrase\n Butler used to describe how she hears, rather than sees, her imagination, the tribute kicked off in February and continued Thursday with a panel discussion of her work at the Los Angeles Public Library.\u00a0Readings, film programs and city tours are planned, culminating in a mixed-media exhibition at Pasadena's Armory Center for the Arts featuring work by eight artists inspired by Butler's archive at \nThe Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens\n in San Marino.\n\"She is, in my mind, someone who has not been properly recognized in the city of Los Angeles,\" Clockshop founder and director Julia Meltzer said at the Huntington, just a few miles from Butler's hometown of Pasadena.\nButler was part of a wave of feminist writers whose work focused on gender ethics, sexuality and racial politics and what they could mean for the survival of the human race, said science fiction writer Steven Barnes, who knew Butler. She was the first to feature women of color as heroes of those stories within the universe of science fiction, he said.\nThe post-racial revolution will be televised\nBarnes and his wife, writer and educator Tananarive Due, are participating in the tributes to Butler with a \nwebinar\n on Friday in which they will share a recording of a conversation they had with Butler in 2000 about her writing.\n\"For me, Octavia Butler's significance as an author is her commitment to creating worlds that mirrored our own with an eye toward steering humankind in a better direction,\" said Due, an American Book Award winner who teaches Afrofuturism at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"She was very bothered by humanity's self-destructive tendencies, and so much of her fiction is about trying to help us see the dangers of our present course and trying to present alternatives. She wanted us to think and to act, and her passion and prescience really makes her impact timeless.\" \nA different view of of Los Angeles \nBorn in 1947 to a domestic worker and a man who shined shoes, Butler sought refuge in writing from her isolated existence as a tall, awkward black girl growing up in the 1950s and 1960s. She received little encouragement from her mother or grandmother, who helped raise her after her father died. Their attitude was understandable for the era, when few people of color -- and even fewer women -- pursued careers as writers.\nButler prevailed, graduating from Pasadena City College in 1968. She went on to study at the Screenwriter's Guild Open Door Program and the Clarion Science Fiction Writers' Workshop, where she found a mentor in science-fiction great Harlan Ellison. She took a series of temporary jobs on factory assembly lines and elsewhere while honing her craft. \nAfter the success of her novel \"Kindred\" in 1979, she was able to support herself writing full-time and went on to capture top literary accolades. In 1995, she became the first science-fiction writer to win a prestigious MacArthur Foundation \"genius grant\" fellowship. \n\"Her characters are mostly black women or brown people living in a world that is deeply problematic, and it's a different underbelly than you would\u00a0get in the typical L.A. crime novel,\" Meltzer said. \"Just because of who she was and what she experienced, she writes about L.A. in a different way than you would get in a Raymond Chandler novel. \n\"Why isn't this the story that we hear about L.A.?\"\n'Power is always central to her work'\nWhen the Huntington opened Butler's archive to scholars in late\u00a02013,\u00a0Meltzer saw an opportunity. She approached the Huntington with the idea to let artists access the archive and create works inspired by its contents.\u00a0\nThe massive collection of 8,000 cataloged items and more than 80 boxes of additional material spans Butler's lifetime: childhood drawings of horses; her first short stories written at age 12; journals filled with grocery lists and draft complaint letters to utility companies; book contracts, manuscripts, outlines and programs from speaking engagements.\n\"She saved everything, but I don't think she saved it out of a sense that it was going to be this great treasure trove for people,\" said Natalie Russell, the Huntington's assistant curator of literary manuscripts. Russell spent nearly three years \nprocessing the items\n (PDF), organizing and categorizing the body of materials, which fills a shelf in the Huntington's basement.\n\"She was very reflective; she wrote to herself a lot: notes everywhere on manuscripts, in notebooks, journal-style pages where she pours out herself in a way that you don't often get to see from any person. That's a really valuable resource, especially for someone who is known for being a really private person.\"\nThe items appeal to different people for different reasons. Writer Tisa Bryant fixated on Butler's list of goals in her journals, which read like affirmations: become a bestselling author, buy a beautiful home, help \"poor black youngsters\" go to college, get \"the best health care\" for herself and her mother.\n\"My books will be read by millions of people! So be it! See to it!\"\nBryant, moderator of Thursday's talk, is using the archive to learn about Butler's research process for an essay about self-education and self-determination. The archive provides a road map to her work, which has a timeless quality. Whether it's alien abduction, climate change or the transformation of humanity into three genetic groups, relationships between the empowered and the disenfranchised are central to Butler's work, Bryant said.\n\"Power is always central to her work and not just state power but how we leverage our abilities, our intellect, our bodies against each other for our own gain.\"\nA visionary among futurists\nPhotographer Connie Samaras latched onto library call slips for books that Butler used to inform her stories. Butler researched life in the antebellum South for \"Kindred,\" the story of a black woman in California who goes back in time to rescue an ancestor, the white son of a plantation owner. \n\"What she has done is prefigured the young-adult literature market,\" said Samaras, who is working on a project for the exhibition in October. \"What's profound about Butler's work is, she talks about cultural differences and social differences and people, but it's always in a way to look at human connectivity.\" \nFor the \"Xenogenesis\" trilogy (now published as the \"Lillith's Brood\" books), a postapocalyptic tale of human-alien genetic blending, Butler dived headlong into human anatomy and molecular biology. She even visited the Amazon and has a picture from Machu Picchu to prove it (it's in the archive).\nAs \none biologist noted\n, her vision was \"remarkably consistent with modern molecular biology, even predicting developments that have occurred since the novels were written.\"\u00a0\nAside from mastering the science of her subject matter, Butler built worlds that included people often left out of history and popular culture. \n\"She had a deep commitment to science fiction, and she wrote many wonderful books, but her talent was in worldbuilding,\" said mystery writer Walter Mosley, a friend and contemporary. \n\"And underneath that was a social and political fever which spoke so loudly and clearly to women in the black community.\" \nThose worlds and the characters' struggles are just as relatable today, film curator Erin Christovale said, making Butler's work ripe for new audiences. \nFor Radio Imagination, Christovale is putting together two screenings featuring experimental shorts by black filmmakers that draw upon science fiction and Afrofutrism, genres that Butler's work presaged.\n\"Her work is extremely cinematic; I'm waiting for the day something gets adapted,\" she said. \"It shows the possibility of experimental black film by stepping away from stereotypes put on people of color in the film industry and focusing on personal narratives.\n\"It brings the larger idea that there's not one way of existing, and we don't have one singular identity.\"\n'She opened a door of possibility'\nButler's inclusiveness -- and the struggles of those communities -- is what makes her work resonate among the latest generation of activists. \n\"\nOctavia's Brood\n\" is an anthology of fantastical science-fiction stories written by American organizers and activists, published in 2015. It's since  become a community of writers, artists and activists who see aspects of Butler's work as a blueprint for organizing.\n\"Our realities are not utopian or dystopian, they are realistic and hard, but hopeful,\" \"Octavia's Brood\" co-editor Walidah Imarisha wrote in an email. \"And that is what (Butler) pulls out in her work. As much as the inclusion of marginalized characters at the center, the principles and values which embody positive change have so many lessons to teach us.\"\nThe social and political themes underlying her stories continue to resonate with broader audiences, Butler biographer Ayana Jamieson said.\n\"People on the margins -- black people, women, science-fiction readers, feminists, queer folks, variously abled and gendered folks -- find parts of themselves in her work. Many of her works are coming-of-age tales where people are testing out and discovering who they are. That transformational process, along with the growing pains, joys and shock that go along with it, really grabs people,\" said Jamieson, founder of the \nOctavia Butler Legacy Network\n.\u00a0\nIndeed, Butler's chosen genre allowed her to make the fantastical relatable.\n\"What science fiction does is, it creates a future for the readers, and black people, especially black women, are less considered in the future than almost anybody in this country,\" Mosley said. \"The simple answer is that her legacy is her readers; what she has done is, she opened a door of possibility.\"", "So you want to live off the grid?": "", "12-year-old gets into college": "", "How Africa is giving fast food a new spin": "The young investment banker turned away in frustration and decided to start his own fast food eatery which would raise the bar of service in Nigeria's oil and gas hub.\nIn 2004 he opened Kilimanjaro, a chain of fast food restaurants which today has 20 outlets across Nigeria, including the capital Abuja and commercial center Lagos.\nThe company is one of a growing number of fast food restaurants to sprout across Africa in recent years. Morocco and South Africa have seen average annual fast food outlet growth of between 3-4% from 2009 to 2014 according to Euromonitor, and markets in Sub-Saharan Africa have also become attractive to international chains.\n\"Kenya and Nigeria are most obvious candidates from a macro perspective because they offer the desirable ingredients of an expanding middle-class, and a strong private sector backbone,\" says Elias Schulze, managing partner at the Africa Group, a boutique advisory and venture capital firm. \"They have a challenging but growingly sophisticated supply chain, and adaptable consumer tastes,\" he adds.\nRising incomes, changing lifestyles \nKFC has had the biggest reach across the continent out of international brands, with 771 outlets in South Africa and franchises in Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, Malawi, Ghana, Kenya and Zambia. In 2013, it extended into Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Uganda. \nThis growing palate for fast food is attributed in part to the continent's growing middle class whose disposable income and changing lifestyle left them with with an appetite for quick food on the go. \n\"As incomes rise and all of the usual emerging market dynamics are in play, such as urbanisation, more hectic lifestyles, many people in Africa are also gaining access to chained/branded restaurants for the first time,\" says Elizabeth Friend, strategy analyst at \nEuromonitor International\n. \nThe spread of internet and advent of social media has also exposed young Africans to tastes and preferences of other people of their age group across the world.\n\"They're curious about the foods their peers are eating and the restaurants they are going to, and they're eager for a chance to try them out for themselves,\" Friend adds.\nBlending with locals\nSome international chains have tailored their products to local tastes by adding popular local ingredients. In Nigeria Domino's sells pizza topped with Jollof rice, a West African staple, and suya, a spiced meat dish often served on kebabs by local street vendors. KFC also sells a jollof rice inspired dish in Nigeria and in Kenya it offers a product based on ugali, a popular maize-based porridge.\nHowever, local brands like Kilimanjaro say that the fact that they know their customers far better than their international counterparts puts them at significant advantage.\n\"Nigerians love their local meals and that's our strong point,\" says Ebele Enunwa. \"In fact we are a Nigerian menu quick service restaurant. People like the fact that they can walk in and find food they grew up on -- food they prepare and eat at home and have grown accustomed to,\" he adds. Enunwa acknowledges there is a level of curiosity about western food like pizza or burgers, but he insists that Kilimanjaro serves the kind of fare Nigerians would eat every day for sustenance.\n\"We serve a full range of Nigerian meals freshly prepared on location at each location using fresh produce received from the farm each day. That's tough for a western brand to beat -- I think.\" He adds.\nUncertain future\nApart from their profound knowledge of local tastes and eating habits, home-grown chains are also adept at navigating local bureaucracies and running a business in challenging circumstances, such as when electricity is in short supply. \n\"The main obstacles are somewhat obvious,\" says Schulze. \"Challenging and underdeveloped supply chains, weak logistics networks, expensive and inconsistent power, potentially sensitive local partnerships, awkward or unhelpful regulatory environment,\" he adds.\nThe continent middle-class is still fairly nascent and delicate, Schulze says, and its growth would be key to the long-term term success of any international brand. In many cases, companies can expect a return on investment only if they managed to scale up to 10, 20 or more stores. \n\"Ultimately it's a gamble on the future,\" says Schulze.", "Meet the Gnomist: a force for good": "Her Aunt Marilyn saw and appreciated her fascination with discovery. She gave her gifts of tiny boxes that held hidden gems. They were little surprises like pint-sized glass mushrooms she placed along her windowsill, fueling her young imagination.\nHer aunt died before she was 10, but her spirit still inspired the girl. She was in her 30s when she spotted her first hollow tree, an enormous live oak on a plantation in Charleston, South Carolina. She couldn't help herself and climbed right in. She peered around in wonder and, just as she did decades earlier, dreamt what was possible. \n\"If this was my tree,\" she remembers thinking, \"this is what I'd do.\"\nThe road to discovery\nHere's where we must hit pause. \nBefore you read further, if you haven't already, please watch the video at the top of the article or just below.  Only then will the rest of this piece make sense. And spoiler alert: If you keep reading first, you'll ruin the surprise of the video later. Don't be a gnome-hater. \nDone watching? Great. Now, let's move on. \nLast time we saw Robyn Frampton was June 2014. She and her sons were loaded in their white minivan, leaving behind a legacy in Overland Park, Kansas. \nThe whimsy of the Firefly Forest they'd created along a suburban wooded trail captured the imagination of children and adults, drew strangers together in wonderment and comforted a family reeling from grief.\nFrampton's fairy houses and fanciful tree-hollow homes -- and the effect they had -- were chronicled in \n\"The Gnomist,\" the critically acclaimed short film\n that was acquired by CNN Films and featured last month on \"Great Big Story.\"\nBy the end of the film, the evidence of their efforts -- with one exception -- had been removed. The family behind this dreamlike world, a mother and two sons still finding their way after a divorce, uprooted and drove off into the unknown.\nThat was about a year and a half ago. We set out to find Frampton and see what happened next.\n'Unlike anything I've ever experienced'\nSaratoga Springs, Utah, is a quiet bedroom community about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City. On the morning drive there, sunlight cuts through scattered clouds and the Wasatch Range to the east, the rays twirling in an enchanted dance. The snow-capped mountains loom majestic. We step out of the cold and into the warm home and embrace of the woman we've come to visit: The Gnomist.\nTears spring to Frampton's eyes easily. They come when she speaks of the overwhelming reaction to the film, which was released in the hours leading up to the November 13 Paris terrorist attacks.\nSo far, the film has been viewed online about 2 million times. With the world steeped in hatred, filmmaker Sharon Liese says \"The Gnomist\" somehow has emerged as a salve, an uplifting ray of light, a reminder of humanity's goodness.\nFrampton can hardly believe the standing ovations she's gotten at screenings and can't bear to look up at the masses.\n\"It all comes at me,\" she says, her eyes welling. \"It's unlike anything I've ever experienced.\"\nShe recalls the strangers who've reached out, including those who've cried on her shoulder. She laughs about the band of \"ninja moms\" she met at the Kansas screening, a group that scoured the trail at night in search of the bandits who were stealing and breaking doors. And she opens up a big box to reveal a homemade fairy house, just sent to her by a young person in Colorado.\nThe attention and adoration both touches and baffles her. She insists that she was only a facilitator in Overland Park. What she did, she says, was as much for herself and her children -- whom she was desperate to shield from the pain of divorce -- as it was for anyone else. Everything that transpired was thanks to others, she says, and a gift to her.\n\"I was there in chains. I felt like there was no hope for me,\" says Frampton, who hadn't yet finished college and couldn't find work for more than minimum wage. \"The flame that burned inside me, it was taking its last dying breath.\"\nHundreds of notes fill a scrapbook she lays out on the floor of her sunny front sitting room in Saratoga Springs. Inside are messages that make her laugh and others that choke her up.\nWords left for mythical fairies bolstered her, miraculously appearing at just the right times. As she struggled to believe in herself, a child scrawled in red marker, \"I belive [sic] in you.\" When she felt particularly down, a stranger wrote, \"People who take time to bless others are truly special!\"\nOn days when she felt broken or couldn't catch her breath because she was so scared, she'd spot little girls at a fairy house squealing with glee.\n\"How can that not make you smile?\" she says. \"To see someone delighted, delighted me.\"\nShe learned to remember that she wasn't alone in feeling pain and was reminded that others have it worse.\n\"I wish I can stay sober for the rest of my life. ... 9 days clean from heroin today,\" wrote one person. \"Please bring mom home safely,\" said another. And then, of course, there was the one remembering Allie \"Little Owl\" Fisher, who died of a rare brain cancer at age 3.\nExchanging gifts\nReproductions of fairy and gnome doors are scattered about Frampton's bright rental home. People request them as artwork and she offers them as gifts. They line the top of a kitchen credenza and lean against the wall by the front door. \nThere's a new one she plans to send to Greg Ruether, the director of parks services who insisted the fairy and gnome homes come down. The poor guy emerged a villain in the film and has endured ugly phone calls and the wrath of audiences. Frampton, however, knows he was working within the confines of his job. She also knows what viewers don't: He agreed to let her keep building until she left Overland Park -- and guarded her secret.\nThe door she's made for him is black. A little window opens to reveal a painted gold heart. Written on the window's door: \"To the ogre with a heart of gold.\"\nThere's also a replica of the only door Frampton left behind in the forest: the turquoise one in honor of \"Little Owl,\" a full-of-life girl gone far too soon.\n\"The door is still there,\" Kelly Fisher, Allie's mother, says by phone. \"It's weathered. It's beautiful. It's even more beautiful because it's withstood time so well.\"\nFisher is now a close friend of Frampton's. Fisher says she, her husband Kyle and their daughter Evie still frequent their door along the trail. It's where they go when they need to feel close to Allie. On the day when Allie should have been starting kindergarten, they went there. Sometimes they still find notes. One recently read, \"Praying for you.\" Another said, \"Hugs.\" And on Mother's Day, a stranger left Fisher a card.\n\"That door came into my life at my lowest time when I look back on it. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make it through this grief,\" she says. \"It continues to bring gifts to our life.\"\nThe experience in Overland Park keeps giving back to Frampton, too.\n\"It helped me to never forget what I value in myself and what I value in other people,\" she says.\nShe moved to Utah, where she'd lived a few times before, to be near family. Frampton is one of six kids, has two siblings in the state, and her parents -- who divorced when Frampton was 20 -- live here, too.\nBut she also came with a mission to finish college. She's taken on a heavier-than-normal course load at Utah Valley University in nearby Orem. She's working as quickly as she can to earn her bachelor's degree in psychology and will enter her last semester in January.\nFrampton's overwhelmingly busy. While grateful to be around people who love and support her emotionally, she still worries about finances and what will come next. There are also days when she still feels lost and out of place. Being a divorced Mormon woman in this community, one that is so family-focused, can sometimes be unnerving. \nShe's learned to believe, though, in the journey. She hasn't traveled the road she imagined for herself, but she trusts that she's headed to exactly where she's supposed to be.\nThe magic that remains\nFrampton remembers the first time she spotted a hollow tree and thought to herself, \"That tree could use a door.\" It was while walking on a trail in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she lived before moving to Kansas. \nHollow trees are hard to come by where she lives now. So, too, are lush wooded neighborhood trails. Utah is a largely defined by desert, after all.\nBut along a path in Dry Creek Trail Park, in nearby Lehi, the fairies and gnomes may be stirring -- this time with the approval of the parks department. A little yellow house sprung up in October atop a stump and nestled against an old tree. Painted inside the two front doors: \"Let your light shine.\"\nThe doors open to a tiny room with a tiny bed and a tiny bedspread. On the floor are emptied little jars labeled \"pixie dust.\" \nFrampton isn't sure future buildings along this path are the way to go. It's a trial. She can't and won't allow herself to have expectations that this will take off as it did in Overland Park. That was a special time, a special place, and what needed to happen there did.\nHer sons have moved on. They're focused on school, friends and their own creative experiences. Parker, 16, still plays guitar and is his high school's junior class vice president. Tyler, 14, inspired by the filming of \"The Gnomist,\" has become an amateur filmmaker himself. \nWhat transpired in Kansas hasn't left Frampton. How could it?\nShe has teamed up with an illustrator and hopes to self-publish the book she left behind in Overland Park: \"Lost and Found in Firefly Forest.\"\nAnd she opens up the door to her garage to reveal her latest secret venture -- one she can only work on sporadically these days. It is her happy place, where she can lose herself in whimsy.\nAn enormous, multi-tiered fairy home, fashioned inside a stump she salvaged from a tree graveyard and hollowed out, towers above her 5-foot-8-inch frame. A green shingled roof tops it. Doors formed from an old whiskey barrel are in place, as are some pieces of furniture, an indoor fireplace and bells for the doors.\nShe learned her way around tools -- axes, chainsaws, grinders -- when she was married and her husband was on the road for work. \"If something needed to be done, I had to do it.\" She constructed forts and castles for kids. She built furniture. She finished a basement.\nBuilding, she says, has always made her happy. And when her creations make others happy, there's nothing better.\nShe also likes to repurpose old items. Salvaged wire can be twisted to become furniture. Bins on shelves are full of wood and other scraps just waiting to be transformed.\n\"Where you come from doesn't have to determine where you're going,\" she says.\nCome spring, the big house will be installed in a memorial garden at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City and donated, with her friend Kelly Fisher's blessing, by Team Little Owl, the foundation for brain cancer research created in Allie's memory. It will include a mailbox with a special key that will be presented to young patients who will be invited to visit the house to pick up special packages. \nFrampton can envision a career in organizational psychology. But if she could wave a wand and create her dream job, she'd build these houses for children's hospitals across the nation.\nChildren's hospitals are personal for Frampton, especially the one in Salt Lake City. Both of her sons, when they were much younger, had health scares that landed them there. Parker, as a 3-month-old baby, had to have surgery to separate a prematurely fused skull. And Tyler, before he was 2, was taken by life-flight to the hospital after aspirating on an almond in trail mix.\nThose scares changed how she looked at the world and how she interacted with other people. She thought more about what she could offer, no matter how small.\n\"The truth is we're walking around in a world of people looking down and feeling alone,\" she says. \"Part of the human condition is finding connections, whether brief and for a moment or eternal.\"  \nAnd on the trails we each travel, the Gnomist says, we carry our own gifts we can share.", "Barbershops place books in boys' hands": "It could be a scene from the popular film \"Barbershop.\" But there is one thing that makes Levels different.  At the entrance, there is a colorful display of books designed to capture the attention of boys.   \nThe sign above the books reads, \"Barbershop Books. Well groomed. Well read.\"  \nWhen Andrew Lovett, 4, and his cousin Marquez Caldwell, 5, walk into the barbershop, they each choose a children's book from the book stand near the front door. \n\"Who wants their story first?\" Elaine Lovett says to her two nephews.\nThe boys choose \"No, David.\"\n\"Look at that word.  What does it say?\" Lovett asks her nephews.\n\"No,\" replies Andrew.\nBarbershop Books\n, which has placed those children's books in Levels, is a community-based reading program that creates child-friendly reading spaces in barbershops for 4- to 8-year-old boys. \nAlvin Irby, the founder of Barbershop Books and a former elementary school teacher, has been partnering with barbershops since 2013 to help pair haircuts with childhood literacy.  \n\"One day, I was getting a haircut at the barbershop across the street from my school,\" Irby said.  \"One of my first-graders came inside, and he plopped down on the couch.  He was staring out the window, looking bored. As I watched this all unfold, I was thinking to myself, 'he should really be practicing his reading right now.'\n\"If children aren't reading, if they aren't able to read to learn, they will have limited prospects both in terms of employment opportunities and in the world in general.\"\nWhy kids are reading history for fun\nThere's no doubt there's a need to close the literacy gap for black boys.  More than 85% of African-American male fourth-graders in the United States are not proficient in reading, according to the \n2013 U.S. Department of Education Nation's Report Card\n.\nAnother problem is a lack of black male role models, Irby says. Fewer than 2% of male teachers in the classroom are black, \naccording to the U.S. Department of Education\n.  \n\"We have black boys who are going to school, and they never see a black man in school who's encouraging them to read,\" Irby said.\nThat's why barbershops can be part of the solution. They are recognized in the black community as a cultural center where men and families from different socioeconomic levels interact, says Irby.\n\"You have CEOs going to the same barbershops as people who live in the projects. It creates this unique opportunity,\" he said. \n \"So a father comes in, and he sees another father reading with his son. A kid comes in; he sits down; he sees another (kid) reading. Well, he's modeling positive behavior for this other kid.\"\nStudents who read just once or twice a month score at higher reading levels than students who never read for fun, \naccording to a report by the U.S. Department of Education (PDF).\n   \nThis finding suggests that black boys who make one or two trips to the barbershop per month can significantly improve their reading scores, Irby says.  \nBarbershop Books is now in 11 barbershops in Harlem and Brooklyn, and Irby has plans this year to expand to Detroit; Columbia, South Carolina; and Birmingham, Alabama. He hopes to create reading spaces in 200 barbershops across the country. Starting this April, \norganizations and individuals may sponsor a reading space\n for their local barbershop anywhere in the United States. \nIrby has funded Barbershop Books through two crowdfunding campaigns and foundation grants. Last year, Irby was also awarded a $25,000 Alumni Service Award from his alma mater, Grinnell College.  \nHe's not the only one. A growing number of barbershops in predominantly black neighborhoods are promoting literacy in cities across the country, including Royal Touch Barbershop in Palm Beach County, Florida, and Overflow Barbershop in Columbus, Georgia.\nNewbery Award goes to Latino children's author for first time\nElaine Lovett, who has raised one daughter, brought her two nephews into Levels Barbershop on a recent Saturday and was surprised by her experience.  \n\"Barbershops are, like, a whole new adventure,\" Lovett said. \n\"They have black men around them giving them directions and encouraging them to do something positive.  I think that this is essential, and it will create memories for them that will empower them.\n\"If black boys are told enough by people in their lives that reading is important, they'll begin to identify as a reader. They'll begin to say, 'this is what black boys do.  This is what black men do.' \"", "Bizarre '80s music videos that we still love": "The decade's musical pioneers weren't afraid to push the boundaries to create some memorably bizarre music videos -- and while we might have been scratching our heads, we were too busy jamming to the tunes to really care. \nHere's just a few of the strangest music videos from the '80s:\n\"Burning Down the House\" by Talking Heads \nDavid Byrne \nis known for being gloriously odd. If you don't know where that reputation came from, all you have to do is eyeball some old Talking Heads videos. \nThe 1983 video for \"Burning Down the House\" featured Byrne's giant open-mouthed face sliding down a highway, a child version of himself and awkward synchronized shoulder dancing. \nThe title of the song is inspired by a \nParliament Funkadelic \naudience chant, which drummer Chris Frantz was yelling around the studio before Byrne decided to use a modified version for the name of the song.\nAnyhow, the video is a fully legal acid trip, and still a bit haunting to this day.\n\"Land of Confusion\" by Genesis\nIf you had to describe this 1986 \nGenesis \nvideo to someone who had never seen it, you might say that it was about the Reagans -- and that Ronald drowns, dresses like Superman and meets a Triceratops. Prince also turns his tongue into a hot dog. \nDid we mention the characters were all puppets from the British television show \n\"Spitting Image\"\n? They were certainly not Jim Henson's cute Muppets. In fact, they were all terrifying. \nGenesis frontman \nPhil Collins\n commissioned the show's creators for the video after seeing himself on \"Spitting Image\" as a caricature. \n\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" by Bonnie Tyler \nDid you know this karaoke favorite has a completely bewildering video that plays like a drowsy memory of a nightmare? \nThe dancing ninjas should give it away, but they're really just getting it started. Think wandering in a dark house, topless football players awkwardly gesticulating and a chorus of people with white zombie eyes. Terrifying! \nIt was filmed in 1983 at Holloway Sanatorium, a Victorian Gothic hospital in Surrey, which borders Greater London. We suppose Bonnie Tyler wanted it to be spooky -- and she succeeded.\n\"Loverboy\" by Billy Ocean\nThere seems to be a common theme in a lot of videos from the '80s: bizarre scenarios that have little to nothing to do with the song's lyrics.\nBilly Ocean \nsticks with that theme in his 1985 video for \"Loverboy,\" which is a rocking song all on its own. The video seems to want us to know that a hooded man on a similarly hooded horse is on a quest to meet aliens that have stumbled out of Mos Eisley Cantina from \"Star Wars.\" \nWhy was everyone so obsessed with puppets in the '80s? And more importantly, what do the men with TVs for heads have to do with the little guys bowing to the cube? \nSo confused.\n\"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel\nPeter Gabriel\n's \"Sledgehammer\" got major airplay both on radio and on MTV in 1986, and the video won nine awards at the \n1987 MTV Video Music Awards\n. \nIt used claymation, stop-motion animation and pixelation to create funky images of Gabriel as his face was covered with fruit, transformed into modern art and used as a train track. The singer also lay under a sheet of glass for 16 hours while filming it.\nThe folks behind it were none other than \nAardman Animations\n -- who would go on to create \n\"Wallace and Gromit\"\n -- and The Brothers Quay, highly influential stop-motion animators. \nWhile \"Sledgehammer\" was very weird (think dead dancing chickens weird), we must admit it was a major technical feat. It was also a hit, and holds the honor of being the most-played video ever.\n\"Self Control\" by Laura Branigan\nIt's probably a dead giveaway that this 1984 video will be odd as soon as you see that \nLaura Branigan\n apparently lives with a ballerina who wears full stage makeup at all times. (Does she even know that she's there? It's never clarified.) \nThen she catches a cab that's driven by the Phantom of the Opera, who apparently becomes obsessed with her at first sight. \nThere's an orgy later, too. If this is what the nightlife is like where you live, it's probably safer to stay in. \nThe video was actually directed by William Friedkin of \"The Exorcist\" fame, which may explain some of its creep factor. Friedkin described his vision for the video as \"edgy and dark\" in \na 2012 interview with The Austin Chronicle\n.\n\"Nothing Bad Ever Happens to Me\" by Oingo Boingo\nA bathtub catches on fire. Lead singer \nDanny Elfman\n shaves while women dressed as statues sing to him. Disembodied faces sing from the walls as Elfman spastically dances. \nWe'd love to have been in on the pitch meeting for this 1983 video: \"So, the main course served in the dinner scene will be THREE singing human heads!\" How does \nthat \nget greenlit?\n\"Sat in Your Lap\" by Kate Bush \nMuch like the Talking Heads video, \nKate Bush\n is wonderfully weird, so her videos fit the bill as well. \nIn the 1981 video for \"Sat in Your Lap,\" Bush flails along with red and yellow jesters and roller skates with people wearing dunce caps as they disappear into a faraway light. \nLater, guys with bull horns and ears show up and everyone dances together. It's also notable that Bush's expression in this video is equally as scary as all the characters! \nIn a 1981 interview on the English childrens' show \"Razzmatazz,\"\n Bush said that the song itself was direct inspiration for the video, and she drew the storyboards for \"Sat in Your Lap\" herself.", "Mother Teresa to be declared a saint September 4": "The date falls on the eve of the anniversary of her death, which occurred on September 5, 1997. \nIn December, Pope Francis announced that Mother Teresa would be declared a saint \nafter recognizing a second miracle\n attributed to her: the healing of a Brazilian man with multiple brain tumors after loved ones prayed to her, the Italian Catholic bishops' association's official newspaper Avvenire reported. That miracle occurred after her death.\nThe nun was beatified in October 2003\n by now deceased \nPope John Paul II\n. He approved a first posthumous miracle.\nA 30-year-old woman in Kolkata said she was cured of a stomach tumor after praying to Mother Teresa. A Vatican committee said it could find no scientific explanation for her healing and declared it a miracle.\nMother Teresa was born in 1910 in Albania and baptized Gonxha Agnes, \nthe Vatican said\n in her biography.\nAt age 18, she joined an Irish convent, where she received the name Sister Mary Teresa. Months later, she left for India, landing in Kolkata, the city then known as Calcutta, in January 1929. She taught at St. Mary's School for girls.\nThere, she took her Final Profession of Vows and became Mother Teresa. Nearly 20 years later, during a train ride in India, she felt a calling from Jesus to care for the poor, her Vatican biography said. She established Missionaries of Charity to serve the poorest of all.\nIn 1948, she donned her iconic white sari with blue trim for the first time and walked out of her convent to start her life caring for the poor. She washed the wounded, cared for the sick and dying, and some of her former students joined her over time. She spread her work throughout India.\nMother Teresa \nwon the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979\n. \nPope John Paul II waived the requirement of waiting five years after a person's death to pursue the path to sainthood and opened Mother Teresa's Cause of Canonization less than two years after her death.", "Would you eat this doughnut dog?": "Pecan pie M&Ms have been spotted on store shelves.", "Travel + Leisure has tips for booking the best flights": "", "In their own words: Gender as a spectrum": "So says one of the people featured in\n Joseph Wolfgang Ohlert's\n portrait series \"Gender as a Spectrum\" when asked, \"How would you define your gender?\" \nThe sentiment reverberates throughout the pages of Ohlert's photo book of the same name. It features portraits and interviews with people whose definitions of gender identity rarely overlap, hence the title. The interviews address how sexuality can be fluid, too.\nSuch talk may not sit with well with some in the mainstream, even as the idea of gender fluidity becomes more common in the media and popular culture. That's what makes the book necessary, says Ohlert, who presents \"a documentary collection of portraits and personal encounters,\" not necessarily \"portraits of gender.\" \n\"We wanted to have questions that were pretty intimate, but it was up to each person how they wanted to present themselves and which questions they wanted to answer,\" Ohlert says in the prologue. \"Some do it with humor and eloquence, without having to reveal their innermost selves. It was supposed to be a framework, so that people had the opportunity to say what was important to them.\"\nThe Berlin-based photographer began working on the series in 2013 after meeting a transgender woman named Kaey in a popular gay nightclub in the German capital. She was familiar with his work and approached him about making a book about transgender life. It was before she started taking hormones, and she had \"a very strong urge\" to read about experiences of other transgender people that reflected her reality, Kaey says in the book's prologue.\n\"I felt that something was missing and I imagined what I would like to find,\" she says. \"I wanted to portray people in their differences, their own identifies, their personal pathways and their own words. Not written by some author conveying a story. Not from reporters or non-trans people who had written a book, but transgender people writing about transgender people. I think it's nicer to speak up for yourself.\"\nOhlert was pursuing a similar idea after spending time on the drag scene, and the two teamed up. Kaey introduced him to people in Berlin who led him to people in Paris and San Francisco. He met them in their homes, spending hours getting to know them and asking them questions before taking their portrait. Through the process, the 25-year-old came to learn something about himself as a gay man.\n\"I realized that there's no fixed aspect of my gender and my sexuality that I could define as 'me,' but that it is fluid,\" he said. \"You can drift. You're not trapped at any one point even if you, as I do, define yourself for example as a 'man.' The book is therefore for me an analogy through which to understand life. Gender is a theme for everybody, and is part of every identity.\"", "Why we can't stop body-shaming": "Good luck to you. \nThese days, any sign of body imperfection, particularly being overweight, will bring down the wrath of society -- that is, the Internet. In recent weeks, comedian Amy Schumer, actor Wentworth Miller and model Iskra Lawrence have all faced digital scrutiny of their bodies -- but whether you're a celebrity or not, you \nmay find yourself the victim\n of \nimage-shaming\n.\nRenee Engeln, a Northwestern psychology professor and the director of the university's \nBody and Media Lab\n, notes that our image-heavy (pardon the pun) culture has brought out the critic in everybody.\nWe've always cared about appearance, particularly for women, she says, but technology has made the focus stronger than ever.\n\"It's never been this intense, this relentless,\" she said. \"There have never been so many forums in which you can gaze at different images of women, evaluate them, comment on them (and) share them with your friends.\"\nAnd it's not just celebrities anymore, she adds. \n\"There used to be a class of people who had to worry all the time about how they looked, because it was their job,\" she said. \"Now we don't really have a front line between those people and everyone else.\" \n'The F word'\nOur media culture loves thin.\nTo look at movies, TV shows and photo spreads is to enter a world where there isn't an extra ounce to be found. Women show off impossibly sleek dresses and revealing bikinis; men wear slim-fit shirts and boast washboard abs. Reality shows make a virtue of weight loss; tabloids sneer at \ncelebrities who have \"let themselves go.\"\n \nWant that to be you? Diets and exercise programs promise a healthier, fitter life in mere weeks -- \nsometimes days\n. \nNobody wants \"love handles\" or \n\"bingo wings\"\n  or the \ndreaded \"belly pooch.\"\n  \nIndeed, \"fat\" is the word that dare not speak its name: Large women are \"plus-size\" or \"Rubenesque\" or \"zaftig\"; large men shop at the \"big and tall\" store. \nAuthor Jennifer Weiner called it \n\"the F word,\" \"this dreaded, stinging word.\"\n  \nAnd yet thin wasn't always in, as \nfashion and branding expert Rachel Weingarten\n points out, noting the large bellies and hips of ancient fertility goddesses and the fleshy models of the Old Masters (including, of course, Peter Paul Rubens).\n\"If you think about it in terms of history, the point was that people who had meat on them, that means they could afford food,\" she said. \"That was a status symbol.\"\nToday, says Engeln, status has gone the other direction. \n\"In countries that have a lot of stuff, it's not hard to gain weight. It's hard to stay thin. So being thin becomes a mark of status, because it means you can afford the gym or all that healthy organic food, and you live somewhere where it's safe to go out for a walk every night,\" she said. \"So thinness has really become a marker of status, and when things are associated with status, we want them.\"\nTricks of technology\n \nAnd we don't want to be fat. The fat person is an easy target -- even for children.\n\"Fat hatred has become so pervasive that it is part of the fabric of our language and interactions,\" Robyn Silverman, author of \"Good Girls Don't Get Fat: How Weight Obsession is Messing Up Our Girls and How We Can Help Them Thrive Despite It,\" \nsaid in 2012\n. \"Fat and thin are no longer simply assessments of size or weight but rather of character. So you can imagine why adoption of these attitudes, diet talk and disordered behavior is happening earlier as well.\"  \nAll this comes as Americans are getting bigger. \nAccording to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n, the average adult American woman weighs 166 pounds.  That's up 25 pounds since 1960. (The average American man \nhas gone from 166 to 196\n in the same period.) \n\"An awful lot of us hate fat people, and the fatter we become, paradoxically, the more we hate them (us),\" Richard Conniff wrote in \na Men's Health essay titled \"I Hate Fat People.\"\n \nThough nasty comments about looks are associated with Internet trolls, it can also play with our own minds -- particularly adolescents, says Engeln. In a selfie-loving society, it's not unusual for people to take dozens of pictures of themselves before posting just one image, she says, all to get that key social currency of \"likes\" and \"favorites.\"\n\"There's a series of consequences to thinking of yourself always in how you look to other people, and that's what a lot of this intense media focus has done,\" she said. Eating disorders are one effect of this thinking, she observes, but not the only one: it may also lead to depression and anxiety. \nDon't expect it to get better. Technology, particularly Photoshop and CGI, can perform tricks that would make \na Mannerist painter\n chartreuse with envy.\n\"For the next generation of teenager, it's going to be hard not to hate yourself a lot more physically, because what we mirror to them is so godlike,\" \ndirector Nicolas Winding Refn told New York magazine\n recently, noting the prevalence of CGI body-tweaking in film. \"If you look at the greatest movie stars, we identify much more with imperfection than perfection.\" \nEngeln, who's 40, sees it in her students.\n\"I'm thankful every day that I did not grow up in the era of digital photography and social media,\" she said.\nFighting back -- with empathy\nThere are certainly good reasons to lose weight. Obesity brings with it a risk for health disorders including diabetes, hypertension and sleep apnea. \nBut nobody has ever had to be told that they're fat, says Engeln. \n\"If you're commenting on a stranger's appearance, it's not because you care about health,\" she said. \"You don't care about people's health by shaming them.\"\nSo what can be done about the shaming trend? \nSome women are fighting back. \nSewing blogger Jenny Rushmore \nstarted a trending hashtag\n after a commenter told her to \"eat less cake.\" \nAnd after YouTube comedian Nicole Arbour \nposted a routine mocking fat people\n, \"My Big Fat Fabulous Life\" star Whitney Way Thore responded with her own video.\n\"Fat-shaming is a thing; it's a really big thing, no pun intended,\" \nThore said\n. \"It is the really nasty spawn of a larger parent problem called body-shaming, which I'm fairly certain everyone on the planet, especially women, has experienced.\n\"The next time you see a fat person, you don't know whether that person has a medical condition that caused them to gain weight,\" Thore added. \"You don't know their mother just died. You don't know if they're depressed or suicidal or if they just lost 100 pounds. You don't know.\"\nIndeed, though it's probably a kumbaya pipe dream, a little more empathy would probably do society a world of good -- especially in the age of selfies. \n\"Why does anyone have to be 'other'?\" asked Weingarten, the fashion expert. \"As a culture and as a society, it will never go away fully, but ... we should try not to be judgmental.\"\nThat's what actress Melissa McCarthy, who has \nknown her share of criticism\n over her size, said about the most recent imbroglios.  \n\"We have to stop categorizing and judging women based on their bodies,\" McCarthy wrote in an Instagram post. \"We are teaching young girls to strive for unattainable perfection instead of feeling healthy and happy in their own skin.\"\nSomething worth considering, whatever your skin may hold.", "Why kindness matters even more after Thanksgiving": "I support this energy myself, as I've been producing an annual holiday party and clothing drive in New York City for homeless youths every December since the September 11 attacks. What began as a desire to bring diverse people together, simply to heal, has turned into a minimovement that has also generated support for survivors of Hurricane Katrina and the earthquakes in Haiti and the Philippines through the years. \n As an activist and humanitarian, my heart has long been with those the world has seemingly forgotten. Of course, you don't have to do what I do daily to feel that way. You simply have to have empathy in your heart for fellow human beings. But let's be clear, the holiday season is not the only time to show kindness and compassion toward others.\n\"Look, who are you? Who are you really?\"\n \nGeorge Bailey asks his guardian angel Clarence in \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"\nYou can be Georgia's Kupenda Auset, a two-time cancer survivor whose bright spirit is forever dedicated to the health and wellness of others in spite of her endless battles with the disease.\nYou can be Maryland's Antonio Tijerino, head of the Hispanic Heritage Foundation and one of the most selfless leaders I have met. He mentors countless young people and stands with the children of immigrants at the Texas border as he never forgets his own immigrant journey.\nYou can be Rhonda Bayless in Indiana, single mother, young grandmother and dynamic voice for the voiceless, who has turned the difficulties of her own life into a community garden and empowerment space for those seeking a new path.\nAnd you can be any number of people of any age and race who've assisted me when I was financially destitute, battling severe depression or had no place to live. You could be one of the people who helped me search, as a man, for the father who abandoned me as a boy. \nIt is in the simplest and smallest acts of love and kindness that we create true compassion and empathy -- that we contribute toward the healing of our planet.\nThis is why extreme indifference is dangerous, why one person's miserliness hurts us all. \nI think of this as I travel America, our America. I have witnessed the dissing of the homeless, including some of our military veterans. In one particularly ugly incident in the Midwest, I heard a middle-aged man berate a homeless gentleman asking for spare change at a traffic stop. \nThe homeless person was told he was a waste to society, a bum and the reason our communities have deteriorated. In his tirade, this angry man did not even bother to read the cardboard sign in the other man's hands: \"I did two tours of duty in Iraq. The wars hurt me. I lost everything. Can you please help an American veteran? Please?\"\nI think of this as I hear those who blame poor people for being poor, never bothering to understand the conditions that create and perpetuate poverty. \nI think of this as debates rage about immigrants from Latin America, about refugees from Syria or how some disparage the #BlackLivesMatter movement. \nAnd I think of this when I hear folks mock or hurt with their words women, gay and transgendered people, the elderly, youth, the disabled, people of religious faiths different from theirs and even those who've been the victims of violence. \nYes, I am appreciative of any holiday celebration that allows me to spend time with my mother, the only parent I've ever known, especially as she moves deeper into her golden years. Yet I want that love, that compassion, that spirit of togetherness, of giving, of sharing, of being thankful, to be as natural to us as breathing, every single day of our lives. \nIn a world where there is so much violence, destruction, pain and trauma, and so much hatred, fear, confusion and finger-pointing, we owe it to ourselves, to each other, as sisters and brothers, as family members in the human race, not to allow the holiday season to be the only reason why we show some level of caring. \nAnd there are so many ways to do this. \nIt is looking that homeless person in the eyes, and acknowledging her or his presence, even if you do not have a penny to offer.\nIt is checking in with a friend, or classmate, or family member, or coworker whom you know has been through a difficult stretch of life, to let them know they matter, that their lives matter.  \nIt is offering a smile to a stranger, a warm word to a child or senior citizen, especially if it is evident that child or senior seems to have been abandoned in some way, emotionally, physically or both. \nIt is sharing love in one of the purest ways possible, by offering your home or your religious institution or your community to a person or family fleeing a war-torn country, so desperately in need of a life where death is not permanently trailing their shadows. \nAnd caring is having the ability to listen to the voices of those who might be different from you like, say, Native Americans, as they express what Thanksgiving or the holiday season might mean to them, given their very different history on this land. \nIndeed, I've heard countless individuals say that we are living in ugly and difficult times. Yes, we are. But I also believe we have it in us, as human beings, to make every day a holy day, and every moment we interact with each other an endless celebration of the possibilities of our humanity. \nThe world demands this, we must demand this; it's the greatest gift and the greatest \"thank you\" any of us could ever give.", "Teacher goes above and beyond for students in need": "\"Their needs have be met -- whatever they are ... socially, emotionally, physically, so that they have the ability to learn, \" says Romero.\nShe teaches kindergarten at \nLew Wallace Elementary School\n in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and most of her students live in poverty. Romero works hard to make her kids feel comfortable and safe in the classroom so they can focus on their lessons.\n\"When my students come in the morning, I ask if they've eaten breakfast. Once they've had their breakfast I just do an assessment of needs,\" says Romero. \"I buy and keep in stock socks, jackets, scarves, hats, toothbrushes and snacks. I've done that since I started teaching. And over the years as the population has shifted, I've needed a lot more of those supplies.\"\nRomero and Lew Wallace Elementary are now receiving more help from the community.\n\"A lot of the assistance that I get is from people who want to make a difference.  So now our school has quite a bit of supplies.  Whatever we don't use, we share with the other downtown schools, which has been amazing,\" she says.\nRomero believes that educators are key to developing the lives of our youth.  \n\"Being a teacher is being an advocate, being an agent for their change and to help them in any way that they need,\" says Romero. \"It means really caring about these kids so they can give back and we can keep that cycle going.\"\nAnswering the call\nRomero's mission to help kids went one step further when she got a call from a social worker who said two of Romero's former students needed a temporary home.  \n\"Having a teacher relationship with them is one thing, but having them live with me is different,\" admits Romero.\nAfter speaking to her son, Blaine, Romero invited the girls into her home.

Simon was a civilian K9 police officer before joining a special team whose main mission was to work with the Army.\n\"I was chosen to work with explosive tracking dogs in Iraq. Once I arrived in Iraq in Baghdad, I was shipped out to Mosul, where I worked with the striker brigade working on the first tracking explosive dogs that were attempted in Iraq,\" says Simon.\nDuval says she wasn't prepared when her son came home diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. \n\"He was somebody different, he was not my son that went over there. He was completely changed and that was a shock that I've never experienced before, so it was more of panic. What do I do? What can I do?  How do I fix it?\"\nDuval started researching methods on how to treat persons with PTSD and found that using service dogs was a promising solution. But at the time, there weren't many organizations providing service dogs for veterans.\nIn 2010, she founded\n K9s for Warriors\n to help her son and other military veterans with PTSD.  To date, hundreds of veterans have received dogs and a new lease on life.\nFinding the right dog\nDuval's son is now the organization's director of K9 operations and selects the dogs and directs their training. \nK9s for Warriors trains mostly rescue dogs to become certified service canines for military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The training can take up to a year before the dogs are ready to help them cope with issues like controlling anxiety attacks or fear of public places. \n\"We evaluate the dog for being sound around people, other dogs, noises, cars, and riding in the bus,\" says Simon.  \"We take them to the store and walk them around.

The fact that they occurred simultaneously, however, is a minor miracle.\nIt's not that I am one of those neurotic fathers who is constantly living in fear that something terrible will happen to his child. \nIt is that I am the poster boy for those neurotic fathers. I am the guy who made a 3-year-old wear a bicycle helmet to go on the swings, who hid outside the preschool yard to keep an eye on his kid, the dad who refused to let his son play catcher on the Little League team because\n oh my God, right, like I'm going to let you stand next to people swinging baseball bats. Kill me first, so I can turn over in my grave just thinking about it.\nThere's much talk these days about the concept of free-range parenting -- of letting your kids wander free, outside your supervision, the way we did when we were kids. I don't like the idea of free-range parenting. I'm not even comfortable with the idea of free-range chickens. Who knows what trouble they could get into?\nThe day Max went to kindergarten, there were many, many tears. \nMine, not his. \nSo how is it I went from that place of fear, to this place where, in the immortal words of David Bowie, I'm learning -- slowly but surely -- to let the children boogie?\nIt was, as it turned out, a birthday gift I gave to myself.  And to my son.\nIt wasn't, technically, my birthday. But that didn't matter.\nWhat mattered was that I needed it. He needed it more.\nUnder siege by a dark force\nAbout two years ago, Max began calling up from the school nurse's office, complaining about stomachaches and begging to come home. The situation got worse: Morning after morning he'd be curled up in a ball on the couch, unable to go to school, barely able to speak.  \nHe missed 20 days of school that spring before we figured out what was going on. Max was diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder. His fears had broken through the emotional-physical barrier: they were literally making him sick. Almost overnight, our fun-loving, outspoken, cheerful, full-of-life boy was under siege by a dark force that attacked, almost daily and without warning.\nAs time went on, the bouts of anxiety became less frequent. But they became no less severe.  And to be perfectly honest -- and selfish -- they were as hard on me as they were on him. His anxiety attacks sent an electric, icy fear through every nerve in my body, a fear that held me in its steely grip, a grip that I was certain would stay with me all the days of my life.  And of his.\nThanks to high doses of good therapy and low doses of medication, Max is doing much better these days. The anxiety isn't gone -- it probably never will be -- but Max has learned to breathe through it, to insert positive thoughts, to calm himself. Bouts of anxiety that used to last for hours -- even days -- are now gone in a minute or two.  (I have built a shrine in the living room to Aaron Beck, the father of cognitive behavioral therapy.) Max's easy laugh and stunning smile are back, stronger than ever. \nHe didn't miss a day of school last semester, and just missed getting straight A's on his last report card.\nBut while Max's anxiety was under control, I came to realize that something else wasn't.\nMine.\nMy anxiety about Max, and about his anxiety disorder, certainly wasn't doing me any good -- but I could live with that. However, I had to face the fact that my anxiety was making Max's worse. Had possibly been one of its causes, in fact. \nAnd that's something no father can live with.\nSo I set about letting it go.\nUntying his fears from mine\nI grew up at Rockaway Beach, where we splashed in the waves all summer but never went more than chin-deep in the water. You couldn't: If you went in over your head, the lifeguard would start blowing his whistle and everyone would turn to look at you and my Grandma Fagel would scream \"Oy Gevalt!\" -- Yiddish for \"holy crap!\" -- until you were back, safely, with your feet on the sea floor. So I come about my terror of water honestly.\nMax has taken swimming lessons since he was 5, and last summer reached something like Advanced Super Duper Lifeguard Level. But when we went out on a boat, I still made him wear a life jacket when he jumped in the water and hold on to a rope the entire time he was paddling around.  The other kids found this strange. The other parents found this strange. \nI found it quite comforting. Then.\nBut now, not so much. Now I know that that rope isn't just holding him to the boat. It's tying his fears to mine. \nAnd so I learned, for his sake, it's time to let that rope go.\nAnd the funniest thing has started happening. Max's anxiety seems to be dissipating even further.  What's surprising is my anxiety seems to be dissipating, too.\nWe were invited to stay at a lovely country cottage a few weeks ago, and I came out one morning to see Max standing atop a 20-foot stone wall, his headphones on, his toes dangling over the precipice.\nAnd I stopped. And I looked. And I contemplated how much he would hurt himself if he fell.\nAnd I waved and walked on.\nI don't cherish the thought of my son letting go of the rope, crashing a Jet Ski, falling off that wall. I know how much a teenage boy can hurt himself.  \nBut I've learned that protecting him from those risks comes with its own, more insidious risks. And while I may not be able to protect him from his own fears -- that's something he has had to learn -- I can protect him from mine.\nLast week, even though I think it's one of the most dangerous thing you can do in the city, I bought him a skateboard and took him to one of those half-pipe things, where he promptly fell and nearly broke his leg.\nInside, I was thinking: Oy gevalt.\nOutside, I said: You'll be OK. Get up. Give it another try.\nBecause hey.

The other is Rose Quartz, a dusty pink.\nThe choice of color of the year is \"a symbolic color selection; a color snapshot of what we see taking place in our culture that serves as an expression of a mood and an attitude,\" the company, a division of X-rite, \nsaid in a news release\n.\nPantone determines its color of the year after surveying fashionistas and insiders in pop culture, including movies and music. \nThis is the first time the company has chosen two colors. \nPrevious winners include the reddish Marsala\n, the popping purplish Radiant Orchid, the exquisite Emerald and the boisterous Tangerine Tango.\nBut anxious times call for calmer colors, said Pantone, and Serenity and Rose Quartz fit the bill.\n\"As consumers seek mindfulness and well-being as an antidote to modern day stresses, welcoming colors that psychologically fulfill our yearning for reassurance and security are becoming more prominent,\" Leatrice Eiseman, Pantone's executive director, said in the statement. \nThe two also suggest the \"gender blur\" of modern fashion, which fits with our trans-aware times, it added.\nSome wags on Twitter weren't quite sold on the colors' fashion qualities.

But since the groups were almost evenly split, with a slight leaning toward those who prefer time, she feels that participants were pretty honest during the studies. \n\"It appears that people have a stable preference for valuing their time over making more money, and prioritizing time, is associated with greater happiness,\" the doctoral student in social psychology at the University of British Columbia said.\nOlder people, those who were retired or approaching retirement, tended to say their time was more important than money, which was the reverse for younger participants. \nResearchers sampled working Americans, students at the university and adult visitors of the science museum in Vancouver. The study found that those of various income levels and of both genders still tended to prioritize time over mone\ny.\n The study did not include those living at the poverty level.\n\"We wanted to learn about working adults who could go after more money or choose not to,\" she said.\nThe value of time\nTime has become a hot commodity for working Americans. Adults who are employed full time work on average 47 hours per week, \naccording to Gallup\n. That's an hour and a half more than a decade ago. Americans also tended to take fewer vacation days than their international peers, according to a 2014 Expedia.com survey.\nWhillans' research focused on day-to-day decisions when it came to happiness. \"We aren't saying you should give up your rent money to take a vacation in order to be happy,\" she said.\nBut smaller decisions can possibly play a bigger role when it comes to happiness.\n\"In my personal life, my husband started taking a toll route that was a little more expensive so his commute would be shorter. We know that longer commuters generally make us unhappier,\" she said.\nOthers have challenged the adage that money can't buy happiness though.\nHarvard Business School professor \nMichael Norton told CNN\n in November that people gain happiness when they spend their money on experiences rather than on things. \nPeople who spend their money on vacations or dinner with friends tend to have greater happiness experiencing those events, even if they are only temporary. \n\"Because experiences disappear, they let us make up a reality that was amazing and wonderful, and they make us happier,\" Norton said. \nWhillans added that it's likely having more free time that is vital toward happiness rather than earning more money. \"Even giving up a few hours of a paycheck to volunteer at a food bank may have more bang for your buck in making you feel happier,\" she said.\nWhillans says the findings suggest that there may be links between time and happiness, but more research is still needed.", "What it means to be gender-fluid": "Gender fluidity, when gender expression shifts between masculine and feminine, can be displayed in how we dress, express and describe ourselves. \nEveryone's gender exists on a spectrum, according to Dot Brauer, director of the LGBTQA Center at the University of Vermont. Progressive gender expression is the norm for the university, which offers gender-neutral bathrooms and allows students to use their preferred names. \n\"If you imagine the spectrum and imagine the most feminine expression you have ever seen and most masculine you have ever seen and just sort of imagine where you are on that,\" Brauer said.\nBrauer, who identifies as gender-queer and prefers the pronoun \"they,\" said gender identification is about what feels right for the person.\nInformation is fluid\n\"In my generation, all the information that came to me was filtered through some very sort of limited perspectives and limiting languages. So for example, if I was going to find out about gender, I was going to find out about it through health class in a curriculum that was set by the Board of Education,\" Brauer said. \nSince millennials grew up with the Internet, members of that generation can easily find information on topics like gender expression, added Brauer, 58.\nLee Luxion, who is 26 and also prefers the pronoun \"they,\" might wake up as a man or as a woman, sometimes as both and sometimes as neither.\n\"How I express it is usually how I dress, how I do my hair. But then my mannerisms change. The way I speak might change a little, too,\" Luxion said.\nLuxion agreed that the Internet, along with the emergence of gender-fluid celebrities such as \"Orange Is the New Black's\" \nRuby Rose\n, has made millennials more comfortable with expressing their gender.  \n\"There shouldn't be a sense of what's normal and what is not,\" Luxion said. \"And (with) more representation of transgender or gender-fluid or non-binary individuals, the more likely it is that we are going to feel safe to also be that publicly.\"\nThere are lots of misconceptions about gender fluidity, according to those in the community. Being gender-fluid doesn't determine a person's sexual preference. \nGender fluidity isn't the equivalent of transgenderism, in which a person's gender identity is different from the one assigned at birth. \nLuxion balks at the idea that gender fluidity isn't a valid gender, a refrain they've heard time and again.\n\"Gender fluidity is much more than saying, 'oh, I want to play up the femininity traits that I have' or that 'I want to play up the masculine traits that I have.' It's an actual physical, mental and, for me, emotional shift in how I interact with the world.\"\nMore than just appearance\nTheresa \"TDo\" Do, a 37-year-old San Francisco native, was born and raised female but never felt that way. She appears androgynous with a short haircut and expresses her gender fluidity in how she behaves. \nIn situations when Do feels challenged, she said, she feels more masculine and expresses herself in that way.\n\"The tone of my voice does change. It comes a little bit more forward. My voice drops a bit,\" she said. \"I have been told that I walk really masculine, and I puff my chest out when I'm walking.\"\nWhen she feels like she is in a safer place, she becomes more feminine.  \n\"My voice gets a little higher. I drop my shoulders. I allow people to just get closer to me emotionally and in a physical way,\" Do said. \"For me in particular, when I am in touch with my feminine side, I feel soft.\"\nBrauer said others' perceptions and an individual's interpretation of their own gender play a part in how gender is conveyed. \n\"There's this constant exchange going on. ... Identity is this weird thing that exists between us people. It's like this perception, thought space, between us and other people,\" they said.\nThomas Webb, 33, identifies as gender-fluid and feels masculine \"two-thirds\" of the time. Webb's gender-fluid expression alternates from masculine to feminine with how they dress, from suits to skirts.\n\"When I was in high school, I don't remember words like that ever existing. I didn't learn about the word 'gender-queer' until my early 20s. I was using terms like 'cross-dresser' or 'transvestite' to describe myself, because that was all that I was aware of at the time,\" they said.\nRaising a gender-fluid child\nFranki Davis, 14, identifies as gender-fluid demiboy and uses the \"they\" pronoun. \nDemiboy means a person identifies partially as a man. \nFranki has bright green hair and an androgynous, neutral appearance. Like any teenager, they like to go to concerts, take pictures and Skype with friends.\nFranki discovered their gender identity during adolescence. And when they came out as demiboy, mom Kristen Shaw homeschooled Franki due to the anxiety they faced at school.\n\"My greatest concern was that they were going to be more isolated and the limited friendships they have socially,\" Shaw said.\nShaw said she would tell a parent of a child like hers to understand that it's important to let them grow.\n\"Before our children were born, what was most important was that we proclaimed that all we wanted was a healthy baby. And if we are lucky enough to have that, then we just take it from there. It's a one day at a time process. Our job is to be their life cheerleader and set them up for success,\" she said.\nOpinion and intersectionality\nBrauer writes in a paper titled \"Gender: It's Complicated\" that younger generations see identity through \"the lens of intersectionality,\" which includes age, sex, location, socioeconomic class and other factors.\n\"I might be perceived as someone who has a female sex to be pretty masculine by the gender standards of femininity that exists\" in the mid-Atlantic, Brauer said. \"But here, in Vermont, the standards for gender and femininity are different. So, right here I would be seen not overly masculine and not overly feminine.\"\nWhen Do is in the office, she said, she gets stares from clients when expressing her gender fluidity.\n\"In a business meeting, I might have to look a little bit harder to earn the respect of others,\" she said. And when she leaves the \"San Francisco bubble,\" she feels more tension. \nWebb, who lives in Southern California, said they haven't felt discriminated against because they stopped publicly wearing women's clothing and dressing androgynously. They said it was easier dressing as a man than a woman. \n\"People kind of confuse personality and gender. My personality isn't stereotypically feminine. So even when I'm wearing a skirt and everything, people just look at me as a dude in a skirt for better or worse. ... I don't think they treat me as they would a lot of the trans or other gender-fluid people who happen to act more feminine,\" Webb said.\nFor Luxion, telling someone their gender identity can lead to hurtful responses.\n\"When I get negative responses or people telling me that my gender is invalid or wrong, it's frustrating and it's hurtful, but really it's making me sad that people still aren't willing to take a step back,\" Luxion said. \"It's not doing anyone harm. So I don't understand why they would be so opposed to it.\"", "Barbie is a role model, sort of. Here's why": "This question became the cynical undercurrent to news that Mattel \nunveiled new Barbie dolls\n in three new body shapes -- petite, tall and curvy -- and seven skin tones. The original Barbie is still for sale as well. \nWhile parents and fans of the iconic blonde bombshell cheered the toymaker for making dolls that look more like real people, others couldn't help rolling their eyes at what they saw as a last-ditch effort by Mattel to regain market share as Barbie loses ground to other dolls. \nActress Kirstie Alley emerged as a voice from this camp, asking on Twitter if the celebrations \"seriously\" implied that \"Barbie needs to be taken seriously.\" She stood her ground as people challenged her, reiterating the point that she does not \"consider toys to be role models.\"\n\"I prefer humans,\" she said. \"Apparently it is now politically incorrect to make wisecracks about dolls now in America... and I thought they were just toys.\" \n \nShe's definitely not alone. Various news outlets fired off hot takes questioning Barbie's influence with such headlines as \"Barbie is Past Saving\" and \"Did You Really Feel the Need to Identify With Your Barbie?\" Some argued that Mattel took too long to catch up to other doll makers that have already made inclusiveness a selling point, and Barbie's moment is over.\n\"Mattel is, literally, messing with the mold that made Barbie iconic in the first place. But that mold is more out of touch than ever. Most American girls never looked like Barbie, it's true, but it's also true that most American girls have never looked less like Barbie than they do right now,\" Jessica Goldstein wrote for \nThink Progress\n.\n\"The trouble with Barbie is that if you start taking away her unrealistic elements, she disappears altogether,\" Alexandra Petri wrote in the \nWashington Post\n. \n\"Barbie is either the iconic, unattainable figure, blonde and waiflike, with huge eyes, or she is \u2014 what, exactly? Make her real, and she ceases to exist. She becomes a brand, a category heading, like American Girl, Monster High, Bratz.\"\nAmong the critics, no one seems to be objecting to the idea of curvy Barbie, a petite Barbie or an Asian Barbie with distinct features from \"original Barbie.\" It's more that, as VH1's Taylor Ferber put it, \"I can't honestly say that the plastic toy I played with was something I ever wanted to look like in real life. Primarily because Barbies aren't real life.\"\nAll of that is well and good, except that \ndecades of research\n show that children do absorb messages about body image and identity from toys and play, though studies also show that different kids identify in different ways and that countervailing influences can minimize the impact.\nAs recently as 2006, a \nBritish study found\n that \"girls exposed to Barbie reported lower body esteem and greater desire for a thinner body shape\" than those who had been given dolls reflecting larger body types or no dolls at all.\n\"What people forget is all toys are educational to children, and girls learn what it means to be a girl through the toys they have,\" said University of Kentucky psychology professor Christia Spears Brown, author of \"Parenting Beyond Pink and Blue: How to Raise Kids Free of Gender.\" \n\"I don't think what Barbie looks like is a trivial issue,\" she said.\nMattel has made changes in recent years to address criticism of Barbie's unrealistic proportions and ethnocentric image. Mattel introduced \nEntrepreneur Barbie\n in 2014 and expanded the number of available skin tones, eye colors and hair styles available \nin June 2015\n.\nBrown called the new line the \"first legitimate change\" by Mattel to make Barbie a more positive role model for children. \nIt's more than simply putting a lab coat on the same busty, cinch-waisted doll, or dipping her skinny body in a darker hue. Not only do they come in different shapes and colors, but they have distinct features -- eyes, hair, noses -- too.\n\"That's the message kids need to see, that people come in a range of sizes.\" \nNow, if only the focus could shift away from her appearance, developmental psychologist Erica Weisgram said. \n\"One of the things that's always concerning about the Barbie brand in general is the focus on appearance,\" said Weisgram, who has examined the impact of gender labels and gender-typed toys on children's toy preferences.. \nThere's nothing wrong with being attractive, feminine or girly, she said. But girls should know those aren't the only qualities to aspire to, Weisgram said.\n\"We shouldn't look to dolls as role models,\" she said, \"but we know that when kids are playing, they are enacting social roles. They are playing out what they might want to do in the future.\"", "Why this classic cocktail is getting a makeover": "When, for example, was the time you heard shouts of \"Another grasshopper over here!\" or \"Tom Collins and keep 'em coming!\" above the din of a crowded bar?\nLikewise, the appletini and Red Bull and vodka may require some explaining to future generations.\nThe redoubtable Singapore Sling, however, is no such an ephemeral flake. \nThe venerable gin-based cocktail said to have been invented at \nRaffles\n, \nSingapore\n in 1915 is marking its 100th anniversary this month ... with a new twist.\nThe original recipe is lost but the current one given by Raffles head barman Aaron Manzanillo is: gin (30ml), cherry brandy (15ml), Cointreau (7.5ml), DOM Benedictine (7.5ml), Angostura bitters (Dash), grenadine (10ml), pineapple juice (120ml) and lime juice (15ml). Shake well and strain into glasses filled with ice. \nThe key ingredient is gin.\nThat's where Sam Galsworthy, the co-founder of \nSipsmith\n artisan gin, comes in.\nMORE: Why Singapore may be the world's hottest cocktail city\nThe Galsworthy connection\nQuite by chance, Galsworthy visited the Raffles Hotel and requested a meeting with the food and beverage director the year before the drink's anniversary. \nGalsworthy happens to be a descendant of Sir Stamford Raffles, the British statesman who founded Singapore and after whom the hotel was named.\n\"I've always felt an emotional connection with Raffles because Sir Stamford Raffles was my great, great, great, great, great grandfather,\" says Galsworthy, whose first name is officially Stamford. \n\"When I mentioned this to Nigel Moore [Raffles' F&B director], I saw his face light up as I hoped it would. But I was blissfully unaware that 2015 would be the centenary of the Singapore Sling.\"\nThe timing of Galsworthy's visit was serendipitous. \n\"We had started thinking about what we could do to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Singapore Sling,\" explains Diana Banks, Raffles vice president of brand and luxury sales. \n\"It had to have elements of both the old and the new and we thought that a bespoke gin would be an excellent way to do this, but had not thought of a partner we could work with.\"\n\"I had heard about Sipsmith and their growing reputation for catalyzing the revival of gin culture in London. They share so many of the attributes that Raffles has.\"\nMORE: 11 best new restaurants in Singapore\nAuthentic methods\nWhen it launched in 2009, Sipsmith was the first new copper gin distillery in London to open in 200 years. \nAs well as producing its spirits in copper stills -- the company's three stills are nicknamed Prudence, Constance and Patience -- Sipsmith uses a \"one shot\" process, in which no extra alcohol is added to stretch or dilute the gin.\nOriginally, the Raffles team suggested creating a gin in a style similar to one available around in 1915. \nBut the idea was quickly overruled by Sipsmith's master distiller. \n\"He said 'we certainly will not'!\" recalls Galsworthy. \nTurns out, 1915 wasn't a great year for gin. \nSpicy concoction\nInstead, for its 2015 incarnation -- called Raffles 1915 -- Sipsmith incorporated spices and ingredients from Southeast Asia. \nThe gin is inspired by the hotel's location but is also a nod to Sir Stamford, who developed Singapore as a port for the spice trade and who had an avid interest in botany. \nHe even cultivated spices on Government Hill, now Fort Canning in Singapore.\nSix botanicals that would have gone into an original London gin, and that go into every Sipsmith bottle, form the base of Raffles 1915: juniper, coriander, orris root, angelica, cinnamon and lemon peel. \nOn top of that Sipsmith has added pomelo, lemongrass, jasmine, nutmeg, mace and clove. \nAfter some 40 variations, the Sipsmith team whittled down its recipes to two. \nThese were sent to Turkey, where Raffles Hotel brass were attending a conference, for the final sampling.\n\"It was the best part of the three days,\" says Simon Hirst, general manager of Raffles Singapore. \"There was one clear winner that had a unique freshness and brightness.\"\nREAD: 50 reasons Singapore is the world's greatest city\nThe 'Raffles 1915' gin\nBeginning in November, Raffles 1915 is available in Raffles outlets in Singapore and Paris. \n\"It will be used in Singapore Slings but it's not anchored to one specific drink,\" says Galsworthy. \"Gin is so versatile ... I love it on the rocks or in a martini.\" \nGalsworthy also suggests a garnish of one of the Southeast Asian ingredients such as lemongrass or pomelo. \n\"I love crushed jasmine flowers in it,\" he says. \"Whichever you choose will really bring that ingredient to the fore.\"\nBy the end of the year the gin will be available in Raffles hotels in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh in Cambodia, and Beijing and Hainan in China. \nAll remaining Raffles properties will take delivery in 2016. \n\"It's definitely a long haul product,\" says Hirst, nodding at Galsworthy. \"I think we have our own copper still?\"\nGalsworthy who confirms that, yes, \"Patience\" is exclusively dedicated to crafting Raffles 1915. \n\"It's one of those great opportunities where everything fell into place at the right time,\" says Hirst. \n\"This is a hotel that's built on stories and this is the latest one. \n\"It's a match made in Singapore.\"", "Meryl Meisler: A glimpse of 1970s New York": "From February 25 to April 9, the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York will present a solo exhibition of Meryl Meisler's earliest work.", "Dying Vietnam veteran says goodbye to his two beloved horses": "The three shared an emotional reunion outside a Texas VA  hospital over the weekend. \nDespite his paralysis, Gonzales has made a living out of his passion for horses and is one of the only registered horse trainers in Texas who is disabled, his wife said.\n\"Horses are his life,\" \nRosario Gonzales told CNN affiliate KABB\n. \"We've been training and raising horses for 30, 40 years.\" \nGonzales was shot and paralyzed while fighting in Vietnam. \n \nOn a recent visit to a hospital for a back wound, Gonzalez found out he had also developed liver issues and that his kidneys were starting to shut down. \nSo, his dying wish was to say goodbye to the ones he loved. \nWhether by coincidence or fate, Gonzales's final meeting with his two horses took place May 21 --  the same date his life changed forever in Vietnam some 46 years\n \nago. \nGonzales was wheeled out into the fresh air.

This species, found in Brazil, has a tongue-twisting name: Iuiuniscus iuiuensis\nAnglerfish (\nLasiognathus dinema\n) \nLocation: Gulf of Mexico\u202f \nThis anglerfish takes the award for the ugliest entry in this year's list. Scientists found the 2-inch-long Lasiognathus dinema in the Gulf of Mexico while assessing damage from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. That fishing pole-like thing you see over its head is called the esca, and it's nifty: Bacteria that emit light hang out in the esca, which is great when you're swimming in the deep, dark ocean. The bioluminescent bacteria also help attract prey. \nSeadragon (\nPhyllopteryx dewysea\n)\u202f \nLocation: Australia\u202f \nThis beauty is ruby red with pink vertical bars. And its discovery off the coast of Western Australia is a big deal because this is now only the third known species of seadragons. As scientists point out, if ruby red dragons that live in shallow waters and are nearly a foot long have only now been discovered, what else don't we know? \nTiny beetle (\nPhytotelmatrichis osopaddington\n)\u202f \nLocation: Peru\u202f \nThis tiny beetle is named Phytotelmatrichis osopaddington, after Paddington Bear. Scientists hope that just like in the kids' books about the lovable bear, people will look after this beetle. It's really small. You'd have to line up 25 of them before you'd reach the one-inch mark on a yardstick. This species was discovered in Peru, making its home in the pools of water that collect in the hollows of plants, such as tree holes.  \nNew primate (\nPliobates cataloniae\n)\u202f \nLocation: Spain\u202f \nThis small ape found in a landfill in Catalonia raises a big, interesting possibility: Could we be more closely related to gibbons than great apes? Her discoverers named her \"Laia\" after \"Eul\u00e0lia,\" original patron saint of Barcelona. She lived about 11.6 million years ago, and she appears to be related to humans, apes and gibbons.  \nFlowering tree (\nSirdavidia solannona\n)\u202f \nLocation: Gabon\u202f \nIf we needed more examples of how species are just waiting to be discovered under our very noses, this is Exhibit A. This new tree species was found just feet from the main road at Monts de Cristal National Park in Gabon. But it probably eluded discovery because scientists focused on larger trees. The Sirdavidia solannona is less 20 feet high, with a diameter of just 4 inches.\nSparklewing (\nUmma gumma\n)\u202f \nLocation: Gabon \n \nSixty new species of dragonflies and damselflies were reported in one single publication; that's the most for any single paper in more than 100 years. We love the name scientists gave this discovery: Umma gumma.

At 67, Norman is the oldest graduate of his class of 547 to receive his bachelor's degree. The average age of the graduation class this year was 29.\n\"Columbia University School of General Studies is dedicated to serving nontraditional students who want to pursue a traditional Ivy League education,\" said Christina Gray, communications officer at Columbia University. \"And David Norman is but one example of the kind of exceptional students we serve.\"\nNorman's journey to the graduation stage wasn't an easy one. When he was a teenager, he fell into a life of crime and into the grips of drug addiction.\n\"I was a very shy kid, and I was also selling narcotics, and in that capacity you were taught not to show feelings,\" said Norman in a \npress release\n.\"One of the things I realized early was that when I got high, I was able to function socially, which was one of my biggest problems.\"\nLife in recovery after prescription addiction\nNorman's last prison stint ended in 1995; he was serving time for manslaughter.  After he was released, he took a job volunteering as a counselor for a transitional services program. This program helps freed inmates transition back into society.\nAbout two-thirds of released prisoners are arrested for a new crime within three years, and three-quarters are arrested within five years, according in the \nBureau of Justice Statistics\n.\n\"That job changed my perspective. It let me know that I have something to offer,\" Norman said. \"I decided I would devote my time to working toward something bigger than myself.\"\nNorman said he has maintained a drug-free life for over 20 years. On May 16, he received his bachelor's degree in philosophy. \n\"I remember a time when people would avoid me on the street, because of my attitude,\" said Norman. \"Now I smile and say hello to people and ask them how they're doing.\"\nHe works as a research assistant at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. He also continues to mentor those who have been incarcerated.\n\"When my perspective changed, my life changed. Whatever happens outside has to begin inside.\"", "What the '80s really looked like": "\"Everything was over the top.  Big hair, big cars, great music!\" said Greg Graham, who was a high school senior in 1986. \nBack then, Graham was partial to wearing white jeans with a colorful madras shirt over an equally bright, pink Polo shirt (you know he had the collar flipped up). Throw in a Swatch watch, and you've got a perfect '80s ensemble.\nWe asked people to share their photos and memories from the era, and boy did they come through. Most remembered the '80s fondly, even though they chuckled at their fashion choices. When you scroll through the photos, a few trends stand out:\nHair\nSusan McCaughey says she spent at least an hour every day teasing her hair to improbable heights.\n\"I used to have to duck to get into my car,\" she said.\nThen she still had to do her make up and get her nails done weekly in White Plains, New York.\nMcCaughey says she loved Spandex and leather clothes, huge jewelry and pumps in every color. You can't see it in her photo, but one of her long nails was pierced with a diamond stud.\nMarla German doesn't miss spending hours a day getting ready. She favored ankle boots, slim pants tapered at the ankles, lots of black clothing, catsuits, and tight tube dresses.\nBright colors\nEllie DeLano was a college student in the '80s and remembers dancing, laughing and hanging out with her friends from the theater department.\nShe joked that she used to apply makeup by the trowel-full. She credited Aqua Net and \"I Dream of Jeannie\" reruns for her hair style.\n\"I miss the '80s so much. Everything was just bigger and brighter and nobody took themselves too seriously,' DeLano said.\nMusic\nIt's almost impossible to overstate how much music, and MTV, influenced '80s fashion.\nNique Quesada fell in love with Duran Duran and styled herself after the popular New Wave band. You can see her devotion to Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, John Taylor and Roger Taylor in her photos over the years.\nDawn Olson was also a music-obsessed teenager, but she preferred wearing peddle pusher pants, baby doll socks and heels, miniskirts, leggings with oversized tops and, of course, really big earrings. \nIn high school, she became friends with some Los Angeles radio DJs who let her help spin records after school and got her in to nightclubs, even though she was underage. She got to see many of her favorite bands that way, but almost quit her coveted mall job at \"Fashion Conspiracy\" to go to a Psychedelic Furs concert.\n\"I can't tell you the number of times I had to pinch myself,\" Olson said.\nWere you a child of the '80s?

This is the first time either name has cracked the list of most popular names.\nThe lists for boys and girls haven't changed much, with only a few shifts up and down. Perhaps Charlotte, a newcomer to the list last year, is a more popular name after the birth of British royal baby \nPrincess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana\n in May 2015. James and Michael also swapped places, with the former growing in popularity. \nThe boy names are a mix of classics and nods to popular actors and pop culture. The name Liam has steadily been on the rise in the top 10 since 2012, when the first \"Hunger Games\" film, starring Liam Hemsworth, premiered. \nThe Social Security Administration is able to share the ranking because parents provide the names of children when they apply for Social Security cards. The agency started releasing its popular baby name list by gender in 1997 but has \ncollected names dating back to 1880\n. \nBeyond the top 10, less-traditional names are also on the rise. For girls, Alaia spiked from No. 2,676 in 2014 to No. 664 in 2015. Perhaps this can be traced to Alaia Baldwin, a model and the daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin, or fashion designer Azzedine Alaia, the Social Security Administration noted.\nMeilani, Adaline and Zelda are also growing in popularity. Meilani is the name of Jersey Shore star Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley's daughter, born in 2014, as well as the middle name of \n\"Soul Surfer\" and shark attack survivor Bethany Hamilton\n. Adaline was Blake Lively's character in the 2015 film \"The Age of Adaline,\" and Zelda could be attributed either to popular video game \"The Legend of Zelda\" or to continued fascination with writer Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald.\nFor boys, the name Riaan jumped from No. 2,286 to No. 926. This name is connected with the son of popular Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh. Huxley, Omari and Jabari are also rising on the list of popular names. Omari Hardwick is an actor who has appeared on the shows \"Power\" and \"Being Mary Jane,\" while Jabari Parker plays basketball for the Milwaukee Bucks. \nAs for Huxley, the agency is stumped, questioning whether \"Brave New World\" author Aldous Huxley is receiving renewed attention.\nMost popular names for girls in 2015: \n1.

Books featuring Native Americans, on-the-run alien lovers, gay penguins and middle school theater geeks topped the ALA's 2014 list.\nThe list, released as part of the association's \n\"State of America's Libraries\"\n report, finds that a disproportionate share of the books feature non-white, gay or otherwise diverse characters.\nThe organization cited analysis by \nauthor Malinda Lo\n showing that 52% of books challenged in the past decade could be classified as \"diverse.\"\n\"It's clear to me that books that fall outside the white, straight, abled mainstream are challenged more often than books that do not destabilize the status quo,\" Lo wrote on her website. \"This isn't surprising, but the extent to which diverse books are represented on these lists -- as a majority -- is quite disheartening.\"\nIn all, the association said, it received notice of 311 formal written complaints in 2014 questioning the availability of books for myriad reasons: sex, drug use, homosexual themes, politics and offensive language, mostly.\nThe list is topped by \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" by Sherman Alexie, which tells the story of a Native American youth born with disabilities attending a predominantly white high school.\nThe American Library Association said the book, which has appeared on the list for four years running, is frequently challenged as being anti-family, culturally insensitive and sexually explicit, among other things.\nAlexie tweeted that he is the \"proud author of the most banned/challenged book of 2014!\"\nA sex-education book that includes cartoon depictions of naked bodies and sexual acts, \"It's Perfectly Normal,\" also makes a repeat appearance on the list, as does \"And Tango Makes Three,\" an illustrated book about two gay penguins raising a baby.\nThe serial \"Saga\" was one of three graphic novels included in the 2014 list, the others being \"Persepolis\" and \"Drama.\"\n\"Persepolis\" is an autobiographical tale of life in Iran during the Islamic revolution. \"Drama\" depicts middle school from the vantage point of the student leader of the school theater's tech crew.\n\"Saga\" was frequently described as being \"anti-family,\" the American Library Association reported, a stance that amused some fans. The book \"depicts two lovers from long-warring extraterrestrial races ... fleeing authorities from both sides of a galactic war as they struggle to care for their newborn daughter,\" according to its publisher, Image Comics.\nCharles Brownstein, executive director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, told the Washington Post that the presence of three graphic novels on the list shows that \"comics are clearly a vital aspect of the current culture,\" shining a spotlight all the things dividing us.\n \"The books on this list address issues of race, sexuality, sexual preference, religion, substance abuse and many other concerns related to contemporary life,\" he told the Post. \"That's the job we charge our authors with: using art to provide a safe place for audiences to engage with topics of substance in a way that allows them to make their own conclusions.\"\n\"Unfortunately, many (people) would prefer to remove those discussions altogether rather than trust that each individual is capable of making the best decisions possible for themselves or their children,\" the newspaper quoted him as saying.\n11 of America's most spectacular libraries", "Michael Pollan really wants you to cook": "In his recently released Netflix series, \"Cooked,\" Pollan tells the story of cooking and how it makes us uniquely human.\"When we learned to cook is when we became truly human,\" he says.\nThe four-part series is full of beautiful images of exotic locales and families gathering, and close-ups of lovingly prepared meats and breads. It's based on the four classicial elements: fire, water, earth, air. Pollan points out that each is a method of cooking.\nPollan has long been a proselytizer of the local food movement. In his books \"\nThe Omnivore's Dilemma\n,\" \"\nIn Defense of Food\n\" and \"\nCooked\n,\" which the Netflix series is based on, Pollan argues that knowing where our food comes from is vital to our very existence. \nIn the series, Pollan points to the Martu people of Australia. When they moved away from their traditional aboriginal diets toward a more Westernized one, \ntheir incidences of heart disease, cholesterol and obesity rose.\n One of the Martu women profiled says, \"Sugar made us weak.\" \nPollan says that it is a matter of health to understand where our food is from. In the series, he argues we've ceded control of that to large corporations, especially as women entered the work force. While there has been a slight increase in men cooking at home, women are still the dominant force in the kitchen. Since 1965, the amount of time spent preparing food has been\n cut nearly in half\n, from 112 minutes a day to 65 minutes a day.\n\"You have an industry that is trying to undermine cooking as an everyday practice,\" he says. In fact, \none study found\n that half of all calories consumed by children at home come from fast food.\nBut for many of us, the reality of having the time to make our food, let alone know where it comes from, can seem like an out-of-touch luxury. Pollan agrees that we have less and less time, but he also says we haven't made food a priority and have let the food industry dupe us into thinking that cooking is difficult. \nCNN had a chance to talk with Pollan -- in just about as much time as he had to make a quick meal -- about the challenges of truly knowing our food and making time in the kitchen. This is an edited version of that conversation. \nCNN: How do you reconcile living the fast-paced life that we live and finding the time to cook? \nPollan\n: It's complicated, but it isn't all or nothing. It's not about cooking every single night of the week. ... I hope that if you're cooking two nights a week, you can try for three. \nAs a culture, we have fought for money in our fair labor movement, instead of time. In Europe, they have fought for time. So our priority has been having money, and then using the money to, in effect, buy time. And maybe that was a mistake. Maybe we should be out there fighting for more time. \nThere are things that the food industry could do to make it easier to cook, like meal kit companies (such as \nBlue Apron\n, \nPlated\n and \nHelloFresh\n). I don't know if that solves the problem. For some people it does, and for some it may be an entry drug. But at least it gets them started. It would be great if you can go to your corner store and buy things that can help with the setup, like pre-cut onions, carrots, and celery. That would take lot of time off the process. \nI think it's worth encouraging people to take stock of their time. We've figured out how to get \ntwo more days\n a week to be online every year, yet the day is still 24 hours. So we've decided that we are less important. But this is really important, and maybe this activity should compete with some of our online time.\nCNN: We watch cooking shows on TV where they're making things into foams. Chefs are celebrities. Cooking is really removed from most people's kitchen.  \nPollan:\n We are trying to shift that image of cooking, from something that is new and elite to something that is universal and part of human life. \nFrench cooking is really the result of peasants figuring out how to extract flavor from pedestrian ingredients. So most of the food that we think of as elite didn't start out that way. \nSome of it has become fetishism -- \"This is beyond my reach, skills or time.\" We hope to question that and realize that we have everything that we need to cook. \nYes, you have to make time, but not as much as you think. It's not any more than if you go to the restaurant. You can make real food in 20, 30 minutes, but we've convinced ourselves that it is a rocket science. It's a shame. It's the media, and the food industry, they've fed our panic around time. \nCNN: The industrialized, fast-food system we live in isn't going away. Is there a way to operate in that system but still make healthier, better food? \nPollan\n: There are some new concepts that I hope will bear fruit. But I think it boils down to that they don't have to cook badly. But I think if they are making food to last a shelf life of six months, then it's not going to be good. But you see there are ways to do fast food concepts where they're not just microwaving and reheating. And that's all helpful for dealing with the time-strapped. But even then, you still miss certain things, you miss the satisfaction that comes with cooking, that sense of accomplishment. \nIt feels really good to put a meal on your table. Amazing things follow. But when we stop cooking, that falls apart. People tend to eat more separately. There's a social dimension that goes beyond the nutritional dimension. There's everything you learn when you engage in nature. \nWhen you cook, you get to shop. You get to vote if you want the pastured raised pork or the organic grain. You can get to help produce your agricultural system, and you give that up when you outsource your cooking. You become dependent on what's offered -- and that's a shame.  \nThere's a lot of good reasons to cook. We want to shift the balance a bit by inspiring. Cooking is really fun and interesting and all that flows from it is at the core of who we are. \nCNN: You have 15 minutes to get a meal on the table. What do you make? \nPollan:\n I always have boxed, dried, whole grain pasta. I always have frozen spinach in the freezer. And I always have Parmesan cheese. What I will do is boil some water and then microwave the spinach partially. Once the water is boiling I add the pasta. While the pasta is cooking, I sautee the spinach with some garlic and add some red pepper flakes. Put the greens over the pasta, and add some Parmesan, and that's a pretty great meal, and you can do that in 20 minutes or less. \nIf you want you can add some canned salmon on top -- it's still quasi-industrial, but it's far better than a frozen lasagna, and half the amount of sodium. ", "Why it's so hard to kick your sugar habit": "Sugar is hard to avoid, even for people who don't consider themselves to have a sweet tooth. Even if you ignore the copious amount present where we expect to find it, like in a soda, sugar is hiding in many of our foods -- even those that aren't especially sweet. \nAccording to says \nLisa Drayer\n, nutritionist and author of \"The Beauty Diet,\" some breads can contain six grams of sugar per slice. Some pasta sauces may contain up to 12 grams of sugar per serving, and some low fat salad dressings, which people might associate with healthy eating, can contain 10 grams of sugar per serving.  \n\"I think a lot of people think that just because something is natural, it's healthy,\" says Drayer. \"So for example, honey is natural, but it's very caloric and a lot of people might not know that a teaspoon of honey, or agave for that matter, has more calories than a teaspoon of sugar or sucrose.\"\nGood sugar, bad sugar\nComplicating matters, scientists view some sugars as worse than others. \nNatural sugars are found in foods like fruit and milk, in the form of fructose and lactose. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is no reported evidence of adverse effects from eating these sugars, and fruits and vegetables also contain vitamins, minerals and fiber.\nAdded sugars, on the other hand, are included during processing or preparation of food and drinks. These provide no nutritional benefits and can contribute to weight gain and obesity. This can lead to serious problems.\n\"We've seen an increase in risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, simply by consuming just one to two sugar-sweetened beverages each day,\" says Drayer.\nThe WHO recommends adults and children reduce their intake of added sugars to less than 10% of their daily energy intake -- and says that reducing it to below 5% is even better. Although national sugar intake guidelines vary by country, the American Heart Association's daily recommendations for consumption of added sugar are a maximum of 24 grams a day for women and 36 grams for men. However, in the USA, the average adult consumes an enormous 88 grams of sugar a day.  \nKicking the habit\nBut it's not just \"hidden\" sugar that's a problem. Another reason why it's so hard to cut down on sugar is that we simply love to eat it. While it's not known if sugar is actually addictive, some research shows it fires off the same reward centers in the brain as cocaine.\n\"It seems to induce cravings and hunger that are comparable in magnitude to addictive drugs,\" says Drayer.  \nA common indicator of addiction is if a person suffers from a loss of control. Drayer explains: \"If a person is obsessing about how he or she will get their sugar fix, and they simply can't focus on anything else, and they have a psychological dependence, then I think you're probably talking about a food addiction.\"\nSo how can we regulate our sugar intake?  Drayer has a few tips: \"Look at the ingredients list,\" she says. \"If sugar or any one of the following terms are listed high on the label, you want to avoid that food: corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, agave, honey, molasses, and anything ending in 'ose'; dextrose, fructose and sucrose are all code words for sugar.\" \nManaging sugar also means managing other aspects of your diet, including portion sizes. \n\"Gradually cut back [on sugar] and consume more protein and fiber-rich foods,\" says Drayer. \"It can actually help curb sugar cravings as well. When we consume protein and fiber, it slows the rise in blood sugar if we consume it with a sugar-containing food. It can help satisfy us and help us reduce our sugar intake as well.\"\nSo cutting down on sugar is not impossible. But, like other aspects of dieting and nutrition, it requires a conscious effort to manage.  ", "Refugee kids find hope on the soccer field and in the classroom": "\"I was taking a drive to Clarkston, Georgia, to visit a Middle Eastern grocery store,\" she said. \"On my way home, I missed my turn, and I had to turn into this apartment complex. I saw these kids outside playing soccer. They were playing in the streets with blocks set up as goals and barefoot with a raggedy soccer ball. It reminded me of how I grew up playing soccer in the streets of Jordan.\"\nMufleh came to the United States when she was 18 years old to attend college. \"I've always felt like an outsider, and I could identify with them,\" she said.\nA few days later, she returned to the apartment complex\u2014this time with a soccer ball. The experience led her to form her first soccer team for refugee boys.\n\"We had 30 kids show up on the first day. And that's how it all started. It was very grass-roots,\" she said. They didn't have uniforms for their first game so Mufleh haggled for some white T-shirts at a discounted price. \n\"With a Sharpie, everybody wrote their numbers and their names and wrote Fugees on it. That was our first uniform,\" she said.   \nBut Mufleh soon realized that what these kids needed went beyond the soccer field. She found herself helping the kids with their homework.\n\"I would go from apartment to apartment helping the kids with homework and eventually started an after-school tutoring program. What I realized when I was tutoring them was that it was just a Band-Aid solution,\" she said. \"Something bigger than after school needed to happen.\"\nMufleh created the \nFugees Family\n, a nonprofit organization, and then opened a privately funded school for refugees called the \nFugees Academy\n in 2007. \n\"When this started, I was a little overwhelmed. I was like, 'How am I going to do this?' I'm not a principal. I'm not an educator, but I am a coach,\" she said. \"I'm good at building teams, and I'm good at getting groups of people to work together and find a goal that we all want to reach.\"\nShe reached her goal and turned the school into reality.\n\"Typically our students have been in this country less than three or four months when they first come in. Most of them have fled war and unimaginable horrors. They've never been in a school before. They've been in refugee camps,\" she said.\nThe academy has small class sizes so the students can get more individualized attention and learn the fundamentals of reading, writing and math.\n\"We have kids that come here who can't read when they enter school. And in four years, they are handing in five-page essays that are very well written,\" she said.\nThe students come from various countries including Sudan, Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\"On paper they should be failing. They have every excuse to fail. They come from a foreign country, they've had no formal education, they live in poverty and their parents are illiterate,\" she said. \"That is a statistic for a kid who will never complete high school. And these kids are going to complete high school.\"\nThe academy has close to 80 students, who are enrolled in grades six through 12. In addition to after-school tutoring, the Fugees Family also includes soccer programs for boys and girls ages 10 to 18 and an academic summer camp. \n\"I love seeing the kids come alive,\" she said. \"Teachers always talk about the light in a kid's eye. And the most heartbreaking part is when that light is no longer there. And I don't get to see that. I get to see that light on every single day, and I love it.\"\nFartun Hassan, a former student at the academy, said she liked the school because the classes were small. For her, Mufleh was more than a coach and a teacher. \"She is like a mother to us,\" she said. \nDespite the success her students have achieved, Mufleh said she can't always protect them from the prejudice that exists in the world. Since the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, she has witnessed some anti-refugee sentiment toward her students. \nIn a recent appeal letter to Fugees Family supporters, Mufleh expressed her concern. \"I try to protect my kids when I can; I don't want them to see any more hatred and ignorance than what they have already experienced,\" she wrote. \nMufleh's goal is to continue to provide a safe environment for her students to learn and grow. \n\"We are Christian, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu. We are Arab, African and Asian,\" she wrote. \"We are refugees. In short: We are Americans.\" ", "Angry obits: 'In memoriam' meets TMI": "Technically, though, the last word on 94-year-old Wilma Black, who died December 22 in North Carolina, was not a news obituary by an impartial writer. It was a paid death notice, written and placed by a family member in the Raleigh News & Observer's advertising section. \nIt detailed a harrowing entry into the world, a turbulent marriage and allegations that neglect may have hastened Black's death.\n\"Wilma always said that her life seemed like a soap opera,\" it read. \"Perhaps not so much a 'soap' as a modern day tragedy.\"\nTrue to formula, the tale took on a life of its own, spawning headlines such as \"\nHow not to write an obituary\n\" and \"\nThe most honest News and Observer obit ever\n.\" In the comments sections of those articles, readers criticized the writer for dishonoring the memory of a loved one, debated whom the author could be and questioned the newspaper's decision to publish it; other commenters claiming to be Black's relatives shared their quibbles with the announcement, endeavoring to set the record straight. \nBy then the damage was done, raising the question of whose fault it is when a vengeful obituary or death notice goes viral. As we become more comfortable broadcasting various aspects of our lives in the digital age, do adages against speaking ill of the dead or airing dirty laundry still hold?  \nA uniquely North American tradition\nEditorial obituaries started in the United Kingdom in the 17th century as way to memorialize members of the community. The first instance in the United States appeared in 1704 in the Boston News-Letter for Jane Treat, granddaughter of Connecticut's deputy governor, who was struck by lightning while reading her Bible, according to obit expert Nigel Starck.\nTwo types of paid advertisements resembling obituaries followed. The death notice started out as a legally required public notice and contained very little biographical information; the memorial advertisement, usually put out by family through a funeral home, was intended to pay tribute to a loved one and share details of final arrangements. \nFunny obits bring new life to a dying art\nToday, \"death notice\" and \"obituary\" are used interchangeably as paid announcements and editorial obituaries become harder to tell apart, especially in the United States and Canada. The vengeful death notice is unique to North America, far more prevalent in the Bible Belt and the Midwest than elsewhere in the United States or Canada, Starck said.  \n\"U.S. newspapers take a major risk in publishing paid death notices that allow detailed opinion on the person in question,\" said Starck, who has studied obituaries and death notices for several books and research publications, including 2006's \"Life After Death.\" \nWhere obituaries used to formulaic and abidingly respectful, the tone has changed as people become more open, said Halley Burns, managing editor for Legacy.com, a site dedicated to obituaries and memorials. (As part of its partnership with newspapers, including the Raleigh News & Observer, Black's obituary was published on Legacy.com.)\n\"Social media drives a lot of it. People feel more comfortable these days sharing more of their private lives, even the parts that aren't happy or glamorous, and that's influencing how they share the news when loved ones die; it's changing the ways they reach out for support,\" she said. \"And, as more of these very unique obituaries get publicity, it makes people realize, 'Hey, an obituary can be whatever I want it to be.' \"\nMore often, that openness is manifested in positive ways through humorous notices or people writing their own obituaries ahead of time, Burns said. Families of addicts often share their struggles as a cautionary tale, hoping to save others the same heartache. \nHonest but not hateful\nTo some writers and readers, the Wilma Black notice borders on the vengeful obituary, a relatively rare type intended to assail one's character or settle a score. \nOthers, including legendary obit writer Kay Powell, do not think it meets that criteria. \nPowell became known as the \"doyenne of the death beat\" during her 13-year tenure at the Atlanta Journal Constitution, where she famously wrote an obituary for Pluto when it lost its status as a planet.\nTo her, the Black obit reads more like an attack on the care she got at the assisted living facility than on the family, she said. \n\"We all bring our different life experiences to our reading of these things,\" she said. \"I'm used to these old Southern gossip tales where all this stuff goes on all the time.\"\nFor example, it's nothing like the \nobituary written for Josie Anello\n, which revealed a long-standing rift over money between her son, the writer of the notice, and siblings who \"betrayed her trust\" and \"broke her heart,\" according to the notice. \nThen, there was Maria Johnson Riddick, who beat her children, ran an escort service from their home and put her children in an orphanage, according to the \nobit written by her son\n, which proclaimed, \"we sang ding dong the witch is dead when mom died.\" \nThese are extreme examples, Powell said. It's possible to bring out peculiar or unsavory aspects of a person's life without dishonoring their memory.\n\"I think it is all right to point out a person's faults or shortcomings or tragedies in their lives. It gives you a fuller, more honest picture, but there's a way to do it,\" she said. \nIt's all about intention, which usually comes through in the writing, she said. The trick is to bring out the details that defined a person's life, good and bad, but not in a hateful way, she said.\nObituaries about addicts tend to fall into this category, she said, citing the family-placed death notice for esteemed Atlanta lawyer \nMarc Ritzmann\n. \n\"While Marc experienced a great deal of material success at an early age, he struggled with addictions to drugs and alcohol all his life and was unable to overcome them.\"\nIncreasingly, though, she sees death notices that read like \"the family was trying to be clever to go viral,\" she said.\n\"If people could just drop the attitude and deal with the facts, that's a more honest way to deal with it.\"\n'Exploiting' a family's misery\nYou don't need to be a professional writer to spin a gripping tale, as Black's notice proves from the opening line: \n\"Wilma Marie Voliva Black struggled into life over 94 years ago. Alone, Eva realized that her sixth child wasn't crying and unwrapped the umbilical cord from her only daughter's neck on December 11, 1921.\"\nDetails of her marriage are related in equally candid terms: \"Her co-star in a church play, Charles Black pressed Wilma into an elopement in May 1939. Wilma later learned that their marriage had been a cover for his sexual affair with their minister's wife. Alcoholism and adultery continued throughout their marriage and ended in Wilma's filing for divorce in 1969.\"\nAnd so it goes until her final years in an unnamed assisted living facility, where \"family concern that she was being neglected was brushed aside\" until she \"died alone\" and was buried \"after (her son) and his mistress returned from vacation,\" according to the death notice.\nWhen reached by phone, the son accused of leaving her to die confirmed most of the details of her life as described in the notice. Yes, her brother was an Olympic wrestler; yes, she divorced her husband after a troubled marriage; yes, she moved to North Carolina in the late 1990s so he could care for her.\nAt that point, his narrative diverged into a story of struggle that anyone who has cared for an aging parent might relate to. He did not wish to publicly comment on her medical care or possible motivations for the sibling who he claims wrote the article, saying that to perpetuate the controversy would be \"an exploitation of our misery.\"\n\"I did what I could to take care of my mother when she needed it, and she was a good mother, even with all of her problems, and I'll miss her,\" he said, asking that his name not be published.\n\"She could be very sweet. She had a great sense of humor, and she was tough. She was a very tough woman.\"\n'A folksy, community-based practice'\nLess than a day after Black's obituary was published January 7, it was removed from the News & Observer's website and from Legacy.com. The newspaper did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\nLegacy.com hosts the online obituary sections for newspapers worldwide, but it does not fact-check or review the content from their newspaper partners. People submit obituaries to the local paper, and the paper sends them to Legacy.com for online publication. \n\"Legacy.com has never rejected an obituary for content, as our policy is that we publish all obituary content that our partners provide. We trust our newspaper partners to do what is best for the family when publishing obituary content,\" spokeswoman Katie Falzone said.\nStarck, author of \"Life After Death,\" said it is rare for a paid death notice to be pulled. But it's a risk North American newspapers run in printing death notices that deviate from the standard formula.\nPart of it he attributes to the \"localized agendas\" of major newspapers in America, where there is no one genuinely national newspaper. Every paper runs editorial obits with a local focus on a wide range of people, from community leaders to school janitors and shop owners.\nThe mood spreads to the paid variety, he said. \"It's a folksy, community-based practice.\"\nReligion plays a role as well, he said. \n\"People want to proclaim their faith and give thanks, often in emotional terms, for lives lived. In the UK, and (albeit to a somewhat lesser extent) the old British Commonwealth countries such as Australia, people do not declare their religious persuasions in such an unfettered manner. It's seen as slightly indecent,\" he said. \nWhen strong editorialization permeates a death notice, it should be subjected to the same sort of ethical considerations normally undertaken by the editorial desk for accuracy, fair comment and the opportunity for an opposing view, he said.\nHowever, \"perhaps the same sort of controlling factors are not enacted in paid advertising,\" making paid death notices all the more \"unreliable.\"\n\"They often contain exaggerations, lies and (as in this instance) unpleasant and unforgivably intrusive detail,\" he said. \"While this latest instance is not exactly 'unique,' it is typical of the bile that can be expressed (and published) through an apparent failure to exert sufficient ethical and editorial control.\"\nMaybe so. But at least one reader of the Wilma Black death notice saw room in the middle for the modern obit.\n \n\"I think this 'type' of obit is much more interesting than the cold, contrite obits that are published every day. They need humanization. I would like to read interesting and personalized obits that gives you insight into the person who has passed, whether you know the person or not,\" a reader said in the comments of the Minnesota Public Radio post \"\nHow not to write an obituary\n.\"\n\"What is wrong with making it enjoyable to read about someone's life?\"", "Mediterranean diet wins again, helps bones": "In this study, researchers examined whether diet quality affects bone health in postmenopausal women. They found that women who ate a Mediterranean diet were slightly less likely to suffer from hip fractures. \nThe Mediterranean diet\n is relatively easy to follow. It involves eating vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and peas, unrefined grains, olive oil and fish. You should limit the amount of meat, dairy, and saturated fat you eat, but on the bright side you can have a glass of red wine at dinner.\nResearchers analyzed data from 40 clinical centers throughout the United States included in the Women's Health Initiative study. The analysis included 90,014 women with an average age of 64. Participants described their diets in a WHI food frequency questionnaire at the start of the study. Researchers then compared their dietary patterns to four common healthy diets, including the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and two others.\nNearly 16 years later, there were 2,121 cases of hip fractures and 28,718 cases of total fractures. Women who adhered the most to a Mediterranean diet were 0.29% less likely to suffer from a hip fracture than women who didn't stick to the diet. The other three diets showed negligible success.\n\"Our results provide assurance that widely recommended eating patterns do not increase the risk of fractures,\" said lead study author Dr. Bernhard Haring of the University of Wurzburg in Germany. \"This being said, the average woman should follow a healthy lifestyle which includes adopting a healthy dietary pattern and being physically active.\"  \nOsteoporosis-related fractures are a major burden for health care systems in aging societies, with women particularly affected, said Dr. Haring. Current research results have been inconclusive about whether intake of nutrients involved in bone metabolism can prevent fractures.   \nHowever, the results of this study suggest that a healthy diet, specifically a Mediterranean diet, might play a small role in maintaining bone health in postmenopausal women. \nThis latest Mediterranean diet research builds on previous evidence that your health might benefit if you follow this diet. It's been shown that the Mediterranean diet can \nkeep your brain young\n, help you \nlive longer\n, \nmanage your weight\n better, and lower your \nrisk for cancer \nand \ncardiovascular diseases\n. \n\"At the present time, the U.S. health system almost entirely ignores nutrition in favor of pharmacology and is hugely expensive and ineffective compared with the systems in other countries,\" wrote Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard School of Public Health, in a related commentary. \"Integration of the Mediterranean diet and related dietary patterns into medical practice, hospitals, schools and other institutions has the potential to improve well-being.\"", "How hard is it to climb Mount Everest?": "", "Is this Latin America's finest food?": "If you answered the Colombian city of Medellin, you wouldn't be alone. \nAnd if you didn't even think of this vibrant Colombian city -- it's been dubbed the City of Eternal Spring for its perma-pleasant weather -- you might want to consider getting here before the masses dub it the world's next great foodie destination.\nA slew of new restaurants in the city are chef-owned and operated, making for ongoing innovation and menus that are often refreshed. \nHere are a few of Medellin's eating highlights.\nOcio\nWith a name that means \"leisure time,\" Ocio specializes in slowing things down and stopping to smell the 12-hour roasted pork shank.\nThe industrial-meets-contemporary restaurant in Medellin's posh El Poblado neighborhood is known for slow house specialties like  codito pork in an orange balsamic sauce served with locally grown pastusa potatoes. \nThe preferred follow-up is the alfajor banana tempura dessert with ricotta and house-made caramel ice cream.\nChef Laura Londono, who did stints at three-Michelin-star L'Astrance in Paris and two-Michelin-star Il Rigoletto in Italy, decided to do her own thing in Medellin in 2013.\n\"I realized that the city was changing and that people were becoming curious and interested in eating out and eating well,\" she says.\nCarmen\nThere are few better dishes in Medellin than Carmen's plantain-crusted fish of the day served over coconut rice risotto with a baby banana and rum puree.\nThe fish comes fresh from Bahia Solano and Nuqui on Colombia's Pacific coast, fruits reach the restaurant by way of the Amazon and co-chef Carmen Angel is always looking for Colombian ingredients to inspire new dishes.\nThe high-end cuisine comes with a setting to match -- an open-kitchen dining room, a formal one if you're feeling fancier and an ivy adorned-patio perfect for post-grub craft cocktails.\n\"We saw a huge potential for something different and new in Medellin and were inspired by the opportunity to evolve certain culinary constructs in a city that had been so confined for so long,\" Angel says. \"There are only signs of growth right now, every month there are more and more restaurants opening and more diversity in the culinary offerings.\"\nHatoviejo\nColombia's \"comida tipica\"\n \nor traditional paisa plates -- Medellin is the capital of the Antioquia region, where locals are called paisas -- are on the heartier side of the city's haute cuisine.\nPork, corn, plantain and yucca are staples and Hatoviejo has them all. \nSometimes in the same dish. \nThe bandeja paisa is a delicious example -- locals the country over place this dish with beans, beef, chorizo, fried egg, fried plantain, pork rind, rice and avocado among the country's best. \nAnd probably its biggest.\nPrepare to skip dessert.\nEl Cielo\nIf you like your food to sing, smoke and shock, Medellin's molecular gastronomy kitchen, El Cielo, does the trick.\nFrom yucca crisps served atop a box that plays Beethoven's \"Silence\" to a smoking cauldron of dry ice turned palate cleanser to an Amazon-inspired tree of life made from pan de yucca (cassava bread) and gold-dusted chocolate truffles filled with pina colada, El Cielo wants to be a \"roller coaster of senses\" according to its leader.\nChef Juan Manuel Barrientos has been called the most innovative chef in this most innovative city, and his Bogota El Cielo ranks among \nLatin America's 50 Best Restaurants\n.\nMostly because it's fun. \nAnd because the food is first rate.\n\"Medellin definitely will be a gastronomic destination,\" Barrientos says. \"We have a lot of things to offer.\"\nIn Situ\nAt In Situ, the fine dining comes with a side of botanic garden.\nLocated amid Medellin's Jardin Botanico, the contemporary eatery with big doors that open for a near-full view of the garden's pond and palms puts eaters next to nature.\nFor more filling fare, there's a sirloin steak bathed in gooseberry chimichurri.\nBut salads are also a hit -- the Musaenda comes with smoked salmon, fresh herbs from the backyard garden and caramelized lychee. \nA post-meal walk through 40 acres of exotic orchids and a famed 50-foot-tall Orchideorama floral structure isn't so bad either.", "Where are the world's happiest countries?": "Denmark and Switzerland were closely followed by Iceland, Norway and Finland, according to the\n World Happiness Report Update 2016\n, released Wednesday in Rome by the \nSustainable Development Solutions Network \nfor the United Nations. \nDenmark won the title three of the four times the report has been issued, losing to Switzerland only once.\nPeople in Burundi are the least satisfied with their lives, according to the survey of 156 countries, but residents of Benin (153rd place), Afghanistan (154), Togo (155) and Syria (156) aren't doing much better. \nThe United States ranked 13th in overall happiness, lagging behind Canada (6), the Netherlands (7), New Zealand (8), Australia (9), Sweden (10), Israel (11) and Austria (12). Germany came in 16th place, while other superpowers -- the United Kingdom (23), Japan (53), Russia (56) and China (83) -- were markedly lower. \nSome countries that saw drops suffered economic and political turmoil -- including Greece, Italy and Spain -- while Ukraine's political trouble and violence likely caused a significant drop in happiness there. \nMeasuring happiness is important\nHappiness is a better measure of human welfare than measuring education, health, poverty, income and good government separately, the report's editors argue. \nThere are at least seven key ingredients of happiness: People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies, have more social support, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption, experience more generosity, experience less inequality of happiness and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows.\n\"Measuring self-reported happiness and achieving well-being should be on every nation's agenda as they begin to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the report's co-editor and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, in a statement. \n\"Indeed the goals themselves embody the very idea that human well-being should be nurtured through a holistic approach that combines economic, social and environmental objectives,\" Sachs said. \"Rather than taking a narrow approach focused solely on economic growth,we should promote societies that are prosperous, just, and environmentally sustainable.\" \nNot just about the money\nIceland and Ireland both suffered through banking crises that dramatically affected their economies but didn't greatly affect their happiness, according to the report. What both countries have is a high degree of social support, enough to put Iceland in third place and Ireland in 19th place this year, according to the report. \nStrictly focusing on financial well-being can obscure the larger picture, according to the University of British Columbia's John Helliwell.\n\"In Norway, it's quite common for people to paint each other's houses even though they can all afford to pay to have their houses painted,\" said Helliwell, a report co-editor and co-director of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.\n\"They go out of their way to help each other, and it becomes a social event, and those events are enormously supportive of well-being,\" Helliwell said. \"In the commercialization of activity -- when people are more likely to buy things than to do them for themselves and each other -- we lose something along the way.\"\nInequality of happiness\nIt turns out that people are also happier in countries where there's less inequality of well-being, the report found. And happiness inequality has increased significantly \"in most countries and regions of the world,\" said Helliwell, comparing 2012-15 data with 2005-11 data. \nThe country of Bhutan, a tiny country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, ranked No. 1 in happiness equality, followed by Comoros and the Netherlands. South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Liberia had the highest happiness inequality. \nA country may have really rich and really poor people, and the poor people don't have enough money to construct a good life for themselves, he said. Or people may have money but have no social support or friends, or live in an area where there's government corruption or lack of freedom to make their own life choices.  \nThe birth of 'Gross National Happiness'\nIt's no surprise that Bhutan would come out on top, despite not being a world economic power: Its Prime Minister proposed a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011 and launched this international focus on happiness.\nFollowing in Bhutan's footsteps, \nthe U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012\n, recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world.\"  \nIn recent years, other countries have made happiness a public policy goal of their governments. Bhutan, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela have all appointed \"Minsters of Happiness\" to focus on the happiness of their people.

", "No need to wait; grab your food on the way to the gate": "", "How recipes keep memories alive": "The Brown University rare books librarian had never let physical limitations stand in his way, but when his brain stopped working the way he wanted it to -- at age 87 -- he knew that he needed to prepare for the end of his life. \nAdams' parents discussed his end of life wishes during a quiet, private evening before her mother, Virginia, let the rest of the family know. Thomas had decided to receive hospice care at home and in November 2008, the entire family gathered at his home in Providence, Rhode Island to care for him by his bedside. \nAdams did what she knew best -- she cooked for him.\nFood is love\nAdams, a famous Boston chef, had learned how to rejoice in food as a child from her father.  . \nEven though her mother did most of the cooking, he was known for a few mainstays, such as delicious cornmeal pancakes and the perfect mayonnaise, made from a supposedly top secret recipe -- Adams later learned the recipe was verbatim from \"The Joy of Cooking.\" \nAlthough her father's appetite was waning, Adams kept cooking for him until the end. He particularly loved the cream of mushroom soup recipe she had created just for him. \n\"I've always known the importance of food through bringing people together and nurturing them, but I also learned that food can be enormously healing,\" Adams said. \n\"This was how I could say goodbye with love. I put all of myself into that soup.\"\nHer father passed away on December 1, 2008. While the family felt the deep impact of his loss, nothing had been left unsaid and her father died the way that he had wanted to, surrounded by his loved ones.  \n\"We were all very present with him and it allowed him to let go and know that he was forgiven and he was sent off surrounded by love and warmth,\" said Adams. \n\"It showed me that death can be as important as birth, and as beautiful. Through my father's death, I learned so much about life.\" \nAdams recently shared her story of loss and food in a digital cookbook, \"\nThe Endless Table: Recipes from Departed Loved Ones\n.\" She was one of 20 top chefs to share their stories  relating to death in their families.\nA recipe for discussion\nThe stories -- and recipes -- for the cookbook were collected and edited by Ellen Goodman of \nThe Conversation Project\n  and Michael Hebb of \nDeath Over Dinner\n. \nThey both reached out to chefs they knew, or were acquainted with, like Ina Garten, Jose Andres, Tom Colicchio and Christopher Kimball to ask for their contribution and were amazed by the memories the chefs were willing to share. They shared everything from treasured family recipes to vignettes of personal loss, which inspired Goodman to each share a family recipe, and story, of their own. \nMany of the chefs had in fact already had these kinds of conversations with their loved ones and shared how liberating it was. They also revealed that making the recipes of their deceased loved helps maintain their memories and a connection to them. This was the aim of the project. \nAs well as maintain connections, Goodman and Hebb want their cookbook to encourage people to have end-of-life discussions with their loved ones before it's too late. \nGoodman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, co-founded The Conversation Project when she lost her mother to dementia, unable to know what she really wanted in the end when Goodman was faced with making choices on her behalf. \nCo-founded\nBoth Goodman and Hebb have since given TED talks on this subject highlighting how conversations that may seem intimidating, uncomfortable or even scary over a normal and soothing occasion like dinner can break their taboo.\n\"For some, talking about death is like letting it in the room,\" Goodman said. \"The end of life isn't just a medical thing that happens, it's a human experience. People aren't dying the way they want to or having their wishes honored...so having a conversation like this is a gift you give your family.\" \nTo make things easier, the cookbook also contains \na guide\n on how to approach talking about end-of-life wishes, compiled using advice from both health experts and families who have had successful discussions.\nTime for a toast\nApril 16 is \nNational Healthcare Decisions Day\n, which has inspired Goodman and Hebb to encourage families across the country to use the week as a chance to host a dinner party. \nThey want the occasion to be used to toast one another, honor people who have been lost, and for families to talk about their own end-of-life wishes -- because it's always too soon until it's too late, Goodman said. \nHebb, a former restaurateur, came up with the idea for Death Over Dinner when he struck up a conversation about mortality with two physicians on a train. This led to a class Hebb taught at the University of Washington in 2012 -- The Table of Truth: Reimagining the Dinner Table as Digital Media -- and soon grew into a social campaign. \nTo date, over 100,000 dinner parties inspired by Death Over Dinner have taken place across the country. \nThe diners begin by going around the room and acknowledging someone who has passed away and had a positive impact on people's lives, and raise a glass in their memory. The group can then decide how to progress in a \"choose your own adventure\" style approach, depending on who is in the group and the intention of the conversation. Based on the intention, they can work from a series of prompts provided by Hebb's website. \nA popular prompt\n \nasks what someone would do if they knew they had only 30 days left to live: How would they spend it, where are they, who are they with and what about the final day and hours of that day? \n\"Vulnerability begets vulnerability. People who have nothing in common reach a common ground almost immediately around this topic,\" said Hebb. \"It's people looking inside themselves within a group setting.\"\nHebb has seen the dinners change the relationship between a parent and a child as they each reveal things they've never told anyone else. \"It's not that people are afraid, it just needs a proper place. So just honor it with the space and time that it needs,\" he said.\nJasper White, a fellow Boston chef, also shared his recipes and memories in the digital cookbook and opened up during the project to stress that every death is not a tragedy. \n\"Love never dies,\" said White. \"Neither do recipes, and it's a wonderful way to remember someone.\"", "Pool party? Check the health inspection before diving in": "According to a\n report\n published Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, thousands of public pools, hot tubs and the like across the United States are closed each year due to serious violations of health and safety standards. \n\"No one should get sick or hurt when visiting a public pool, hot tub or water playground,\" said Dr. Beth Bell, director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. \"That's why public health and aquatics professionals work together to improve the operation and maintenance of these public places, so people will be healthy and safe when they swim.\"\nEighty percent of public swimming pools, lazy rivers, hot tubs/spas and water playgrounds had at least one violation when inspected, based on more than 84,000 inspections of more than 48,000 places where people swim, lounge and play in chemically treated water in Texas, New York, Florida, Arizona and California. One in eight resulted in immediate closure of the venue because of the severity of the violation.\nIn what may not come as a surprise, kiddie pools and wading pools top the list. Of those, one in five had been closed at some point for one violation or another. The most common violations: improper pH levels, safety equipment issues and problems with the disinfectant concentration. \nChlorine and other disinfectants and chemicals are important to stop harmful pathogens in swimming pools and spas. \nA study\n published in April in the journal Environmental Science & Technology found that when those chemicals mix with \"human inputs\" -- the stuff people add to the water when they get in, such as sweat, urine and cosmetics -- they form compounds called disinfection byproducts. The researchers found there were more than 100 of these byproducts.  Testing in the lab showed that exposure to these disinfection byproducts damaged cells. This means they may be linked to health problems such as asthma and bladder cancer. \nThe authors say disinfection byproducts can be minimized by frequently cleaning spas, more frequently exchanging water in pools and making sure people shower before they get in. \nThe CDC doesn't want you to stay out of swimming pools this summer. In fact, \naccording to the agency\n, swimming is the fourth most popular sports activity in the United States and a good way to get regular aerobic physical activity. The CDC just recommends checking inspection reports before diving in to play.", "Week 35: Baking bread with Ezekiel": "The New Testament is so close. I have resorted to counting the prophets, like miles in a marathon. Nine more to go. \n(If you could see me now, I am shaking my fist in the air in frustration.)\nThis week started with Baruch -- another book that is in only the Catholic Bible. Baruch was the secretary to Jeremiah. So, you can probably guess how I feel about the book. \nA Catholic reads the Bible, Week 33: Jeremiah's long-winded lamentations \nBut there was one thing that was interesting and translatable to today. While talking about idols, Baruch writes, \"Despite the gold that covers them for adornment, unless someone wipes away the corrosion, they do not shine.\" (Baruch 6:23)\nAll I could think of is the popular saying about people chasing after \"bright, shiny objects\" that divert our fleeting attention. It's the same thing for the Israelites and these false gods.\nThe next book is Ezekiel. He's a major prophet and so you might think I could fly through it. The book is divided into three parts. I have only got to the first part because I am back to reading at a 3rd grade level -- slow. \nThe first part of Ezekiel is yet another recounting of all the Israelites' bad deeds. The next two are the road maps for the future, and according to the book's introduction, that is the most significant part. I will get there next week.\nBut, as I was reading, one line struck me. There is a recipe for bread in the Bible.\nEzekiel 4:9 says, \"Again, take wheat and barley, and beans and lentils, and millet and spelt; put them in a single vessel and make bread out of them.\" \nI thought to myself, I should try to make that. And that lead to a great many thoughts about bread.\nEverything in the Bible is about sustenance -- both literal, like food, and figurative, like faith.\nFood has been used as punishment, like having wormwood to eat and poison to drink (Jeremiah) or what I thought of as price gouging on food during another famine (Kings 6:24) as punishment, but I hadn't thought about creating the bread.\nI couldn't get it out of my head. \nIt is something so simple that carries throughout the Bible -- and as we just celebrated Easter, it was even more present in my mind.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I am fixated because I am looking ahead to the New Testament. \nAnd there is this famous line about bread that is coming: \"Then he took the bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them saying, 'This is my body which will be given for you; do this in memory of me.'\" (Luke 22:19).\nAs I have since learned, there is no need to make the Ezekiel-recipe bread. Companies out there have beaten me to it. But my editor really wants me to bake Ezekiel bread and bring it to the office. \nI may try it while I read the rest of Ezekiel and trudge through the next nine prophets.", "Is one minute of exercise all you need?": "It sounds like a dubious exercise regimen promoted on a late-night infomercial, but there is actual science behind it. A recent study suggests that one minute of vigorous exercise can be just as effective for improving health as 45 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise.\nResearchers asked nine previously sedentary young men to do one total minute of high-intensity cycling on a stationary bike three times a week for 12 weeks. The minute was broken down into three 20-second bursts of maximum effort, with two-minute recovery periods of moderate-intensity cycling in between. \nAnother group of 10 men undertook a more traditional workout consisting of 45 minutes of continuous, moderate-intensity cycling three times a week, and six men did not exercise at all.\nAt the end of 12 weeks, the researchers found similar gains between the high-intensity and moderate-intensity groups, compared with the no-exercise group, in terms of better blood sugar control and improved endurance and muscle function.\n\"This study is a relatively extreme example that shows the effectiveness of brief, very intense bursts of exercise,\" said Martin J. Gibala, professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Ontario. \nThe one-minute approach is \"the most intense flavor of interval training,\" an approach that alternates between all-out exercise and less-intense activities, said Gibala, who led \nthe study\n (PDF), which was published in April in the journal PLOS ONE. \nThe new study found that high- and moderate-intensity workouts also were associated with similar amounts of modest weight loss and boosts in calorie burning, Gibala said. However, the most important way to lose weight is \"on the energy-in side of the equation, what we put in our mouth,\" he added.\nDuring the three 20-second bursts of activity, the researchers asked the men to ride the bike as if they were sprinting from danger. \"It is about as hard an effort as you can imagine,\" Gibala said. The researchers measured the participants' power output to assess whether they were pushing themselves as hard as they could.\nBut the sprinting was only part of a workout that lasted 10 minutes from start to finish. It went like this: Two-minute warmup on the bike; 20-second high-intensity pedaling; two-minute moderate-intensity recovery; 20-second high-intensity pedaling; two-minute moderate-intensity recovery; 20-second high-intensity pedaling; three-minute cool-down on the bike. The moderate-intensity workout also involved a two-minute warmup and three-minute cool-down. \nIt could be hard to design an effective workout that is any faster, Gibala said. You need the recovery periods because it would be difficult to push your body to its limit for 60 seconds straight. And the warmup and cool-down periods are important for preparing your body and preventing injury. \n\"I think we are getting down to the bottom in terms of the number of minutes of exercise in order to get some benefits,\" Gibala said.\nThere has been a \"flurry of interest\" over the past 10 years in comparing high-intensity interval training with moderate-intensity exercise, he said. Although \nprevious research\n, some by Gibala and his colleagues, suggested that the high-intensity approach was similarly effective, the current study is the first to go as low as 10 minutes total.\nNo pain, no gain\nThere is probably a price to pay for a 10-minute workout. What people may gain in time, they could make up for in terms of pain. \n\"At the end of the day, there is a tradeoff between intensity and duration. There is no such thing as a free lunch. If people want to derive the benefits of [a short amount of] exercise, they need to go hard,\" Gibala said.\nNevertheless, this hard and fast workout could be a good option for people who say they never have time to exercise. \nThe American Heart Association and other professional organizations \nrecommend\n 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week. People with high blood pressure or cholesterol should get closer to 120 to 160 minutes of vigorous exercise a week.\nBefore 10-minute workouts can be part of any recommendations, more studies will have to be done into whether they reduce the rates of disease and improve lifespan, similar to the myriad studies showing these benefits for longer-duration, less-severe workouts, Gibala said. \nMore exercise could still be better\nThe popularity of high-intensity training has been spreading, from elite athletes to normal Joes, said Sherry O. Pinkstaff, an associate professor of physical therapy in the Brooks College of Health at the University of North Florida. It is even starting to be studied as an alternative to longer-duration, moderate-intensity exercise for people who have heart failure, said Pinkstaff, who was not involved in the new study. \nHowever, many questions remain about high-intensity training, Pinkstaff said. For example, people might come up with \"just another excuse, like they have to take a shower once they [exercise],\" or they might lose interest after a while in putting themselves through a more strenuous workout, she said.\nIt may also be the case that people doing a 10-minute workout will miss out on some of the mental benefits of traditional exercise, Pinkstaff said. For example, studies have found that exercise can \nboost mental sharpness\n among older adults and that it \nreleases feel-good hormones\n.\nPeople who opt for short bursts of exercise would probably also fail to reap some of the heart benefits of exercise lasting 30 to 60 minutes.\n\"The sustained increase in blood flow through the arteries is important,\" said M. Harold Laughlin, chairman of biomedical sciences at the Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center at the University of Missouri, who was not involved in the current study. \nAnyone who is at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack, including people who are obese or have high blood pressure, should talk with their doctor before starting high-intensity training, Pinkstaff said.", "Nominate a 2016 CNN Hero": "It's easy to nominate the person whose work you admire.

Not one of the elementary-school-aged children seems surprised. \nBut her announcement is surprising -- historic, even: Kagedan, of Mount Freedom Jewish Center, is the first woman to have the title of rabbi serving an Orthodox congregation. \nIt is a job she has dreamed of holding since she was a little girl, but rabbinical school did not exist for women in the Orthodox movement for most of her life. \n\"Growing up the only model of rabbi in the Orthodox world were men,\" Kagedan says. \"So in some ways this really didn't feel like an option.\"\nCalling herself 'Rabbi Kagedan'\nKagedan, 35, grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Montreal. Her father, who passed away two years ago, was her \"greatest teacher,\" studying Jewish texts with her on most nights and urging her to follow her dream.  \n\"I wouldn't say that he told me that there were no barriers -- I would say that he had no idea how this would come about,\" Kagedan says. \"His message to me was to arm myself with the rabbinate texts, to know them intimately. But he cautioned me not to be angry. And if I was feeling angry about exclusion to take that anger and do something very productive with it.\"\nKagedan spent years studying bioethics around the world, but always continued studying Jewish texts with the hope that she could one day attend rabbinical school. And then, in 2009, a school called Yeshivat Maharat opened with the hope of helping women achieve leadership positions in the Orthodox Jewish community. Kagedan graduated in its third class. \nThere have been Orthodox Jewish women before her who took the title \"rabba,\" but Kagedan was firm in wanting to be called Rabbi Kagedan. \n\"I knew that I wanted my title to be the most accurate description of my training,\" Kagedan says. \"I didn't want to walk into a room or a space and have there be any ambiguity of what it is that I was there to do. What my training was. What my skill set was.\"\nThe idea of a female rabbi is not accepted by everyone in Orthodox Judaism. The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), an organization made up of Orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution in October 2015 in response to Kagedan's school, Yeshivat Maharat, ordaining women as rabbis, calling it \"a violation of our mesorah [tradition]\" and saying the school's decision to do so was \"a path that contradicts the norms of our community.\" \nWhen asked about Kagedan's new position, Rabbi Mark Dratch, the RCA's executive vice president, said the organization \"encourages a diversity of [sanctioned] and communally appropriate opportunities for learned, committed women,\" but it does not accept the ordination or recognition of women as Orthodox rabbis. \nKagedan says she is a product of RCA education and that her greatest teachers were part of the organization. But, she hopes the group will come around to the idea of women leading congregations.\n\"Women need to see other women in these leadership positions to keep them motivated in their Judaism, to have leaders that they can relate to, that they can feel comfortable with in different ways that they might not feel comfortable with their male leadership,\" Kagedan says. \"I guarantee you only positive outcomes will emerge from having men and women working in the rabbinate and being accessible to the community.\"\nKagedan says she has been warmly welcomed by members of the Mount Freedom Jewish Center, about an hour outside of New York City, where her primary focus will be teaching. She sees herself as a rabbi there to serve both men and women, but understands why her position is so important to women in her congregation.\n\"I hope to normalize women in leadership roles,\" she says. \"When I look out at the community and I see  ...  young girls, I hope that they get a sense that anything is possible. That nothing is out of their reach. And that it might be a tremendous struggle and it might come with tremendous sadness and frustration but that if they want something badly enough it's their responsibility to create a mood where this can come about.\"\nBigger than just her \nKagedan's life is delicate balancing act between upholding Orthodox Jewish traditions that are dear to her, and pushing her own boundaries in this new role. \nBeing a female rabbi has its range of challenges in an Orthodox setting -- even where to stand.\nIn Orthodox synagogues, men and women sit separately in the sanctuary when they pray, with a divider separating them. At Mount Freedom Jewish Center, men sit on the right side of the room, and women sit on the left. The rabbi stands on the right. \nKagedan discussed this with Rabbi Menashe East, who hired her at the synagogue. Where could she stand when giving a sermon to the congregation? They chatted for a few minutes about how to simultaneously embrace her monumental new role while respecting the rules and traditions of the religion their ancestors have preserved for centuries. \nThe impact of Kagedan's appointment at the beginning of 2016 is already being felt. A month or so after East introduced her to the congregation, he asked his eldest daughter what she wants to be when she grows up.\n\"'Maybe I'll be a rabbi,'\" East recalls her saying. \"''Yeah, I could be like Rabbi Lila.'\"", "How to buy and eat caviar, according to a pro": "The fish eggs sparkle inside his namesake restaurant in the historic Alwyn Court Building on 58th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, one block from Central Park. \nPetrossian -- the third generation to work in the luxury business founded by his grandfather in Paris almost 100 years ago -- is here to guide the uninitiated through the fascinating process of selecting and eating the finest caviar. \nThough the delicacy of Russian royalty still ranks among the most expensive foods in the world, costing up to hundreds of dollars for a tiny bite, Petrossian is anything but pretentious. \nInstead, he's unabashedly passionate when sharing his love of sturgeon roe and introducing others to it. \n\"It's often the case that people are afraid of trying caviar for the first time,\" he says. \"They don't want to invest their life savings. But there are ways you can enjoy caviar without breaking the bank.\" \nWork your way up\nPetrossian advises novices to \"come with a learning attitude\" and \"to educate\" their palates, which he compares to the journey of becoming a wine connoisseur. \n\"Don't buy too high a grade at first, it's not necessary,\" he says. \n\"Start with the lower grade and work your way up.\" \nTop grade caviar is usually more mature and lighter in color. He suggests first-time buyers try tranmontanus caviar from California, which costs about $50 for one serving. \nThough Caspian Sea beluga is a name usually associated with caviar, overfishing endangered wild sturgeon so importing it became illegal in 2005.\nLuckily, farm-raised tranmontanus is somewhat affordable, \"easy to enjoy and you'll have the total experience of delicious caviar,\" says Petrossian. \nAfter trying this \"Mercedes of caviar,\" you can proceed to \"the Rolls-Royce and the Maybach.\"\nDon't buy it till you've tried it\n\"Try the caviar you're going to buy, that is key,\" as taste can vary from tin to tin, he says.  \nAnd a buyer should always be wary, Petrossian cautions, as sometimes caviar is a \"fishy business -- I mean that without being funny.\" \nA few shady distributors purposely mislabel tins, akin to putting a Chanel tag on a knock-off purse. \nPetrossian suggests always examining the \nCITES\n (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) number that's on better tins. \nThis international organization, which regulates wild game, names the actual fish the caviar came from.\nKeep it cold \nOnce you purchase your caviar, there's about a six-week window to enjoy it. \nPetrossian stresses that temperature is key. \n\"Put it in the deepest and coldest part of your fridge, usually where you store vegetables,\" he says. \n\"Open the tin at the last minute and then put it on crushed ice.\" \nHold the silver, but not the vodka \nNow the tricky part, how exactly do you eat caviar? \nFirst, you'll want to \"feel comfortable around these little fish eggs,\" says Petrossian. \nSo relax, this is a treat to savor. \nSecond, you need a spoon made out of a neutral material like wood or bone as silver reacts with the fish eggs. \nPut about a half teaspoon in your mouth and \"crush the little eggs with your tongue on your palate. Just mix the oil,\" says Petrossian. \nFor the purest experience, he likes to eat caviar \"straight out of the tin\" -- you can add toast points and creme fraiche as your taste develops. \nYour first bite of caviar should dazzle, bursting in your mouth with a satisfyingly rich, perfectly salty, exotic flavor. \nTo dry the palate before the next delicious taste, Petrossian recommends either traditional vodka or Champagne as \"the bubbles remove oils on the tongue.\" \nIt's a matter of taste, not price\nSitting in his restaurant, Petrossian tries \"one of the better caviars\"-- a Special Reserve Alverta that runs just over $200 per serving. He takes a bite and, even after a lifetime in the business, his eyes sparkle. \n\"My God, it's delicious,\" he says. \n\"The eggs are huge and firm. It's deep without being too strong. The flavor is robust. You feel it on your tongue for a long time.\" \nDespite his reaction, Petrossian says \"there is no actual best caviar.\" \n\"There is the most expensive because it's the rarest,\" he says. \n\"It can be the best to you. Or the best to you can be the cheapest. It's all a matter of taste. And all tastes are different.\"\nWhat matters is that when you do find your perfect tin of caviar, you are also buying the inevitable special memories that come with it, says Petrossian. \n\"Whoever you share caviar with makes the experience even better,\" he says.\nOne of his favorite memories was when his son tried the delicacy for the first time -- at 18 months old. \nPetrossian says the toddler's first reaction was \"a little, 'what is that?'\" \n\"Then he just had his mouth open [as if to say] 'I want more. Give me more.'\" \nAnd that seems to be the prevailing trend with caviar -- after one bite, you're hooked for life.", "Week 37: Prophetpalooza": "I read through: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah and Jonah.\nTaken all together, their writings are sad. These prophets are trying to warn the people of Israel, and yet no one seemed to be listening. (Yes, we have been here stuck in groundhog day for a few hundred pages -- or a few hundred years in the Bible.)\nI didn't know anything about Hosea, Joel, Amos or Obadiah. I only knew about Jonah because he was swallowed by the whale. But, that was just a few short lines in that book.\nThere is a whole lot more in there. Jonah wasn't a happy man. The coloring book version of the story wouldn't tell you that. He suggested that he should be thrown into the sea to calm it. The introduction says that it's a precursor to the idea of redemption and mercy in the New Testament. Bring it on.\nI bet you haven't even heard of Obadiah. It's the shortest book in the Old Testament at 21 verses and that alone should have made it my favorite. But, instead, it's all about vengeance against Edom -- an enemy of Israel. Fire meets brimstone.\nThis all led me to the weekly question of what in the world am I going to write? But, as I flip through my notes, I am starting to see a new trend emerge.\nThirty-six weeks ago, I took notes on almost everything I read. I kept track of the number of cubits in the ark or the order of the Kings. It was all new to me. I needed that content to understand what I was reading.\nBut it was a crutch as I wrote summaries or tried to find my focus.\nNow, my notes aren't on content. They are focused on the verses that I like and have relevance to me. It's my personal evolution.\nA perfect example of this happened in Hosea - Chapter 6, verse 6. It's a simple line \"For it is love that I desire, not sacrifice, and knowledge of God rather than holocausts.\" It made me think of how we go through Lent -- it's not about what you give up, but rather what you do.\nHolocausts to idols was the accepted form of worship -- just like how we were all taught to give up soda or chocolate for 40 days. I saw a parallel in my personal life. This past Lent, I focused on doing service instead of giving anything.\nAnother example was also found in Hosea -- Chapter 13:2: \"Now they continue to sin, making for themselves molten images, silver idols according to their fancy, all of them work as artisans. 'To these,' they say, 'offer sacrifice.' Men kiss calves!\"\nWhile I laughed at the line about men kissing calf statues, I thought it is, at root, a conversation about the look of a church or how beautiful it is. It made me remember it is about the conversation and worship of God, not where you do it.\nIn that short book of Obadiah, verse 2 gave me chills. \"See, I make you small among nations; you are held in dire contempt.\"\nThe verse, which is talking about Edom, was a reminder that if you need help with a creative insult or a threat -- just flip through your Bible. I think \"dire contempt\" should be introduced into the lexicon of today for an ultimate insult.\nRealizing this shift in my notes made me really happy and gave me the push for those final books. It's time for Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.", "Waitress gets a huge tip and a note that says ...": "", "Sriracha now comes in to-go packets": "Have no fear hot sauce lovers, a new single serving packet of the hot chili sauce is here.\nThe red chili pepper sauce has become a dietary staple for some spicy food lovers.

And research agrees: A recent study out of the University of Georgia found that some people who take one- to three-week vacations put on nearly a pound during their trip, while others gain as many as seven pounds. (Yikes!)\nTo help you avoid the same fate on your next summer vacay, we asked experts to share their no-hassle nutrition practices that keep any trip from turning into a gluttonous getaway. By following these tips, the only thing you'll have to worry about packing is your bags, not any extra flab.\nControl your morning meal\nFew people want to hold back at every meal on vacation. Instead, try to set the tone for the rest of the day by practicing a little bit of mindful eating and control during your first dish. \"I tell clients they can control breakfast, snacks, and portions,\" says Stephanie Middleberg, a New York City-based RD. \"Typically lunches and dinners tend to be the wildcards [on vacation], and more indulgent. So I have clients skip a carb at breakfast and keep it to one plate.\"\nIf breakfast or brunch is likely to be a decadent one, eat something beforehand, recommends Jackie Newgent, RD, author of The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook. \"Enjoy a cup of berries before you go to brunch. It'll help take the edge off of your hunger so you can order smartly,\" she adds.\nRELATED: 3 Travel Tips to Help You Feel Zen Before Your Vacation Begins\nSnack smarter\nIf you're going on an all-day excursion and don't bring snacks, you'll likely be ravenous by your next meal. Or, if there aren't any healthy options available en route, you may end up choosing food you normally wouldn't eat.\nNewgent's fix? Remember the three P's of snacking: plan, pack, protein. \"Plan ahead, pack portable snacks, and be sure your pick has protein,\" she says.\nTake the tip a step further and build every snack with a protein and a produce. Pick a piece of fruit and pair it with Greek yogurt, a cheese stick, two tablespoons of nut butter, or 10 to 15 raw nuts. The protein element keeps hunger pangs at bay until your next meal (unlike a carb-only snack that doesn't have satiating power), while the fruit packs fiber and other key nutrients.\nGrocery shop\nA trip to the nearest supermarket is one of the first stops on Sass' vacations. \"Go to the grocery store and load up on things to either make meals on your own or complement room service or restaurant meals,\" she says. Stock up on fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal for a light breakfast. As well as plain popcorn, hummus, individual nut butter packets, and healthy crackers to have smart snack options on hand at all times.\nRELATED: 17 High-Protein Snacks You Can Eat On the Go\nAvoid the buffet\nIt's tempting to pile a plate at the buffet with pancakes, fruit, bacon, scrambled eggs, and a chocolate-filled croissant on the side. But you could easily pack in a day's worth of calories if you're not careful; buffets make it far too easy to overdo portion sizes and eat past the point of fullness.\n\"I never eat at buffets unless they're included or my only choice,\" says Sass. \"And if so, I stick with customizable dishes, like a made-to-order omelet with lots of veggies and avocado paired with fresh fruit, or a made-to-order stir fry that allows me to choose lots of veggies, lean protein, and light sauce with a portion of brown rice that I can control.\" You could also regulate portions by ordering a la carte, or treating yourself to room service if necessary.\nIf you do decide to stick to the buffet, don't feel obligated to eat everything in sight. \"Even if I have to pay for a buffet and don't eat much, I don't see it as not getting my money's worth,\" Sass explains. \"I tell myself I'd rather pay more for a correctly sized meal that leaves me feeling energized, rather than getting more food for that amount of money that leaves me feeling stuffed and sluggish. It's just not worth it, especially if it zaps your energy for the whole day on vacation.\"\nTake the long way\nWhether it's walking to dinner, jogging to a museum, or taking a paddleboarding break from reading on the beach, move as much as you can -- even if it means taking a bit of a detour (an adventure in itself!). \"Plan extra -- and fun -- activity into your itinerary so you can have extra delights at your destinations to fully enjoy your travel experience,\" Newgent says.\nThis article originally appeared on \nhealth.com\n.

I didn't know him very well ... but the jealousy, the rage, all of that stuff came pretty soon after,\" said Collier about her ex-boyfriend, whom she started dating early in high school.\nThere was so much isolation, she says, remembering how he went through her phone one time, deleting all of her male friends in her contacts and on Facebook, and how he told her she couldn't talk to guys or go to parties.\nReluctant to get too specific, she says the relationship was abusive in multiple ways. Ultimately, she cut off communication with him after she started college.\n\"I was very blind to the situation, and you know, when it's your first love and all of that, you really think that that kind of thing is, 'Oh it won't happen again,' or 'He was just so mad,' or 'I lied to him so I deserved that,' but it progressively got worse.\"\nThis summer, Collier's father wore a \"One Love\" baseball cap to support the \nOne Love Foundation \n-- an organization created in honor of \nYeardley Love\n, the University of Virginia lacrosse player who was beaten to death by her ex-boyfriend just three weeks before she would have graduated in May 2010.\nCollier's father encouraged her to check out the foundation. \"I think that was his way of saying, 'I'm wearing this hat in honor of a girl that was not as lucky as you.'\" \nSo one night she went up to her room and looked up every news article and video she could find about One Love, and made a decision to create a campus organization called Team One Love at her college this past fall. \"I was like, 'OK, if I don't do this for anyone else, I'm going to do it for myself.'\" \nThere are now 40 active Team One Loves on college campuses across the country and nearly 6,000 Team One Love members. The goal is for the students to take the lead in educating and empowering their peers about the signs and dangers of relationship abuse. It's all part of a #ThatsNotLove campaign that One Love Foundation officially launched back in October.\n'Every kid has a stake in solving this problem'\nBut this goes way beyond a campaign. The One Love Foundation hopes #ThatsNotLove starts a movement.\n\"I think the idea behind #ThatsNotLove is how can we think of a lot of different, creative ways to emphasize the same core message, which is that there is a difference between relationships that are about love and relationships that are about control, that you can see in some of the earliest phases of a relationship behaviors that are healthy and unhealthy,\" said Katie Hood, chief executive officer of the One Love Foundation.\n\"We're trying to sort of make this very clear, that every kid has a stake in solving this problem. Every kid has a stake in working for change and thereby make it easier for people to do so,\" she said. \nTo drill that point home and get to teens and college students where they are -- on social media -- One Love worked with an outside agency to create \"couplets,\" eight digital shorts featuring animated emojis, which in a very clear-cut way indicate how intensity, obsession, isolation, disrespect, blame, control, anger and put-downs are most definitely not love.\nSince the \ncouplets were launched this month\n in honor of Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Protection Month, they have been viewed nearly 5 million times and counting, according to One Love. \n\"They demonstrate exactly what we're trying to say with 'That's not love,' but they do it a lighthearted way,\" said Sharon Love, Yeardley's mother and the founder of the One Love Foundation. \"They're not threatening. They're very simple but they bring the point home directly.\"\nAdded Lexie Love Hodges, Yeardley's sister: \"They can capture a whole relationship in five seconds.\" People don't always recognize relationship abuse when they read an article about it or listen to someone talk about it, she said, but here they can see the behavior demonstrated in a way they might click with. \n\"The topic of relationship violence is so heavy. I think that's why it's not talked about often and I think that the couplets ... make it more approachable for friends to bring it up in a different way,\" she said.\nIn addition to the digital shorts, \ntwo public service announcements also titled \"That's Not Love\"\n have been released, and have been viewed more than 5 million times on Facebook and YouTube since October.\n'We were so clueless'\nRelationship abuse is an issue that was never discussed in her household, Sharon Love said during a phone interview from her home in Baltimore. \n\"We were so clueless,\" she said, adding that she and her family knew nothing about it and didn't feel like it was a topic they needed to be concerned about either. \"We didn't realize there were signs, and we're trying to turn that upside down. ... The signs are somewhat obvious but they're masked as love. You can think that they're madly in love with you when they're really just trying to control you.\"\nLove said she also had no idea about the statistics -- how one in three women and one in four men will experience some form of physical violence in a relationship in their lifetime,\n according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence\n, and how \nyoung women 16 to 24 experience the highest rate of domestic partner violence -- nearly three times the national average. \n\"I feel like what we thought of domestic violence was of someone that was married with children, that was stuck in a situation, that was dependent on the abuser and couldn't get out,\" said Love, saying what came to mind was Farrah Fawcett's portrayal in the movie about domestic violence, \"The Burning Bed.\" \n\"That was like stuck in my head. That's what relationship violence is,\" she said.\nIt didn't ever occur to her that relationship abuse could impact young people, let alone that young women in Yeardley's age group were at the highest risk.\nOn May 3, 2010, when Yeardley was just 22 and weeks away from her college graduation, Sharon Love awoke to police officers at her front door. Life as she and her family knew it was completely over.\n\"It was incomprehensible to me that someone I knew, someone that Yeardley cared for, had taken her life,\" she \nwrote last year in a letter posted on the One Love Foundation website\n. (Yeardley Love's ex-boyfriend \nGeorge Huguely \nwas convicted of murder and is currently behind bars.)\nThe MADD for relationship abuse? \nDetermined to raise awareness among teens and help them recognize the warning signs of abusive relationships, Sharon Love started the foundation in the hopes of doing for relationship abuse what Mothers Against Drunk Driving has done for drinking and driving.\n\"They changed a whole mentality, with generations now thinking it's appalling to drink and drive. My generation didn't think anything of it,\" she said. \"So we're hoping that relationship violence will be appalling behavior and something that you speak up against right away.\"\nThe foundation created a\n film called \"Escalation,\"\n which showcases a fictional relationship between two students, Paige and Chase, that starts to turn very wrong, very quickly. In the film, Chase wants to be with Paige all the time, gets jealous when she spends time with men, begins to isolate her from her friends and grows increasingly more angry and violent as she starts to pull away. The film has a tragic ending and concludes with photos of young women who in real life were killed by their abusive partners.\nI watched the film last year as it was being rolled out on college campuses around the country. It left me shaken and so upset. I watched it again before writing this piece and feel exactly the same way.\nSo far, the film -- along with a 45-minute workshop led by student facilitators -- has been shown nearly 700 times at colleges and high schools across the country, with nearly 35,000 students participating. According to Hood of One Love, nearly 90% of students who participated in workshops said they thought it should be required viewing at their school, and 97% said they would recommend it to a friend even if it wasn't required.\n'Rocketed' to understanding\nThe goal, an ambitious one, is to have 100% of students on every campus in the U.S. see the film and participate in a workshop, said Hood. \n\"Because movement is our goal, we just want as many eyeballs to see it as possible,\" she said. \"We now think that if ultimately we want to change the social climate on campuses, so that people can speak up when they see things, then it can't just be a pocket of kids that see it. It has to be many, many more.\"\nI wondered why One Love wouldn't just release the film on YouTube and allow teens across the country and around the world to see it. Hood said there are two reasons. First, it could be triggering for someone who is an abusive relationship, she said, and you would want to make sure there were resources available or you could communicate to that person what resources are available when they watched it. And second, she said, while the film is powerful, the workshops are more powerful.\n\"You walk in, you think this has nothing to do with you. And in 38 minutes, which is the length of the film ... you're sort of rocketed to not only understanding the issue, being more aware of it, you recognize that you've seen it before,\" said Hood. \"You have a connection to it.\" \nBecause ultimately, that's part of the sad reality of relationship abuse. We all most likely know someone who has experienced this.\n\"It doesn't discriminate. It's not just poor people. It's not just people without fathers or mothers or guidance. It's everybody. It's your sorority sister. It's your friend. It's your sibling. It's your child,\" said Mattis Collier, who hopes to be able to work with One Love after her graduation in December and then go to law school to work on the issue of domestic violence in college athletics.\n\"And I think it's very important for people to realize that you need to talk about it and you need to explain it while you're younger. It's not just bruises that are giveaways for an abusive relationship. ... It's how someone talks to you. It's how someone treats you. It's how someone talks about you to others.\"\nShowing people they have a role to play\nCollier wishes the \"Escalation\" workshop were required at her high school and college. Right now, just over 40 schools require it with a subset of students, including athletic teams, fraternities and sororities, and freshmen, according to One Love.\n\"I wish that this was a required seminar for high school, for college students, because the lack of knowledge and education awareness in our country is astounding,\" said Collier.\nAs One Love looks to the future, it hopes not only to increase the number of schools where \"Escalation\" workshops are held and also increase the number of schools where they are required, but also to deepen the engagement of students, with more Team One Loves -- more students like Collier facilitating workshops, training students to be workshop facilitators and holding \"That's Not Love\" events where they write words on sheets to match what love is and what it is not.\n\"It may sound crazy to have these ambitious goals about starting a movement and getting to 100% of the kids on college campuses,\" said Hood, \"but it's sort of pretty simple what we're trying to do. We're trying to just wake people up to their personal connection and get them to develop their voice and understanding that they have a role to play.\"\nWhat drives Sharon Love and the rest of her family is trying to prevent what happened to Yeardley from happening to any other young person in a relationship.\n\"I feel pretty confident already that we are saving lives,\" she said. \"We've gotten so many letters from so many people that have gotten out of a bad situation, and really just one of those letters makes it all worthwhile.\"\nWhat do you think is the best way to try to prevent relationship abuse among teenagers?

The researchers taught about a third of the parents about graduated extinction, a technical term for crying it out. Parents were asked to leave the room within a minute of putting their child to bed and, if their children cried, to wait longer and longer periods of time before going back to comfort them.\nAnother third of the parents were asked to try a newer type of sleep training called bedtime fading. In this approach, parents put their infant to bed closer to the time he or she usually fell asleep and could stay in the room until the child dozed off.\nThe rest of the parents, the control group, did not attempt sleep training and instead received information about infant sleep.\nThree months after starting the intervention, the researchers found that babies in the cry-it-out group were falling asleep almost 15 minutes faster than babies in the control group. The babies in the bedtime fading group dozed off about 12 minutes faster compared with the control group.\nThese improvements would probably be important for parents in more ways than one, said Michael Gradisar, associate professor of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. \n\"What our data probably do not capture is the peace of mind surrounding bedtime that we see when we work with families,\" said Gradisar, lead author of the study, published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics.\nThe researchers found that the graduated extinction, or cry it out, group also bested the fading approach in other measures during the three-month intervention, including the number of times babies awoke during the night and their total sleep time.\nMarsha Weinraub, professor of psychology at Temple University, agrees that the gains in sleep would help both babies and parents. \"When you are waiting for your baby to go to sleep, every minute counts,\" said Weinraub, who was not involved in the new study.\nAlthough the new fading technique seems to be effective, it is less effective than graduated extinction, and parents may want to try the latter approach if they are comfortable with it, Weinraub said. \nSleep training did not stress out babies\nThe most important aspect of the study, Weinraub said, is that both sleep training techniques seem safe for babies in the short and long term. The researchers found that the levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, were lower in the babies in during sleep training interventions. Moreover, one year after the interventions, the babies did not show signs of being more attached to their parents, nor did their parents report more behavioral problems compared with the babies in the control group.\n\"Parents have been told by some experts that children's stress levels will increase over time with these techniques and they will have behavioral problems, and this study shows very clearly, which I think is the first to do so, that there are no [poor] effects on children's stress levels and ... children in the intervention groups show less stress than children in the control condition,\" Weinraub said.\n\"This is a concern that has been expressed by many parents, which is interesting to me as a scientist, as there is no compelling evidence to support this claim,\" Gradisar said.\nWhat's more, the study offers an alternative to letting babies cry it out. \"Bedtime fading is the more preferred technique parents choose when provided both options. ... It's a gentle technique that works quickly,\" Gradisar said, adding that \nthe university's website\n has instructions on how to carry out both sleep training methods.\nGradisar and his colleagues found that by a year after the sleep training interventions, all of the babies, including those in the control group, were getting about the same amount of sleep. They suspect this is because babies' sleep health improves naturally as they get older. \nWhich sleep training style should parents choose?\nDr. Tanya Altmann, a pediatrician based in Southern California and author of \"Mommy Calls,\" advises her parents to start sleep training almost from birth. It starts with newborns having a comfortable, safe sleep environment, typically a crib or bassinet. By the time the babies are 2 to 3 months of age, parents should put them to bed when they are drowsy but not yet asleep. \n\"It can really benefit them in the long run because self-soothing and sleeping techniques really stay with them throughout their entire lives,\" said Altmann, who is also the author of \"What to Feed Your Baby.\" However, it can be helpful to try sleep training for babies who are still having trouble sleeping by 6 months, she added. \nAs for which method to choose, the two methods in the study appear to help in different ways, which could help guide parents. \n\"If you have an infant that only has nighttime awakenings, it appears from this study that bedtime fading is not as effective,\" whereas both methods could help if your problem is getting your child to fall asleep in the first place, said Daniel Lewin, a pediatric psychologist and sleep specialist at Children's National Health System in Washington. \n\"In the real world, you could do a combination\" of the two, Lewin said. Parents could put their child to bed later and delay visiting the child if he starts crying, for example.   \nHowever, this type of training is not for everyone. Not all parents report that their children have sleep problems, and it is this subset of parents for whom the current findings would most relevant, Lewin said. \nFor those parents who do think their babies have trouble sleeping, the study brings even more good news: It did not take parents the full three months of the sleep training trial to see effects. Babies in both intervention groups were falling asleep faster one week after their parents started the training, and they continued to improve over the three-month period. \n\"The thing I often tell parents is that it only takes three days, and [sleep training] is effective,\" Weinraub said.\nEven babies who sleep well can get thrown off when they have a cold or an earache, she said. But if they have a good sleep schedule, it is easy for them to get back on track in just a few days, she added.\nDon't feel bad, Mom and Dad\nParents can feel a lot of guilt about not comforting their babies while they are crying. \"[But] by setting a clear and loving limit for your child, children can function better,\" Lewin said. \nIn his practice, Lewin talks with parents and reassures them that they are not deserting or punishing their child by letting him soothe himself to sleep. \nThe cry-it-out method can also be difficult for busy parents. Parents may think, \"I want to see my infant; I haven't seen them much today,\" Lewin said. It is OK for parents to feel conflict about this, he said, but it is important for them give children the space to fall asleep on their own.", "Purple bread: A new superfood?": "Professor Zhou Weibiao, a food scientist at the National University of Singapore, isn't wrong.\nAccording to current nutritional thinking, white bread is digested too fast, spikes blood sugar levels and is linked to obesity. In short, it's the enemy of healthy eaters.\nZhou's answer to this problem? He's invented a purple bread.\nRich in cancer-fighting antioxidants, digested 20% slower than regular white bread, and made entirely of natural compounds, it could be the first superfood of the baked goods world.\nThe great bake off\nA long-time staple food, bread's big problem is its high glycemic index: its sugar content speedily gets into the blood stream, causing blood sugar levels to peak and crash.\nFurthermore, its rapidly digestible starch content means people often eat more of it than they should.\n\"The challenge was to see if we could change the formula of bread, without changing the smooth texture of white bread that people really love,\" says Zhou.\n He decided to extract anthocyanins from black rice -- which give the grain its much trumpeted antioxidant qualities -- and infuse it in his bread. Zhou left behind the rice's starch properties.\n\"Despite its antioxidant capacity and associated health benefits, the knowledge of using anthocyanins as an ingredient in food products is very limited.\"\nAdding anthocyanins to the bread not only turns it purple: due to a chemical reaction with the starch enzymes, it slows the digestion rate by 20%.\nWhat is more, 80% of the antioxidant qualities are preserved in the breadcrust and crumbs when baked at 200 degrees Celsius.\n\"If you want to enjoy the texture of white bread and slow down digestion, this is probably the best formula,\" says Zhou.\n\"And the color isn't bad, either.\"\nThe color purple\nAnthocyanin is a natural pigment that occurs in fruits and vegetables such as grapes, blueberries, and sweet potatoes, and is responsible for their vibrant hue.\n\"Although, not all purple fruits are superfoods,\" cautions Zhou, citing purple dragon fruit as an example.\nStudies have shown that anthocyanins can help prevent cardiovascular and neurological diseases and cancer, and play a role in controlling obesity and diabetes, as they can inhibit digestive enzymes and reduce glucose levels.\nCalorie count\nPurple bread might be healthier than white bread, but does it have a lower calorie count?\n\"You are eating the same amount of starch and wheat flour, so the nutritional value is the same. The key idea here is slowing down the energy release, so you use those calories over a longer period of time,\" says Zhou.\nWhile the purple bread is not yet commercially available, Zhou has been approached by major food manufacturers about bringing it to market.\nHe has also inspired some blue (or should that be purple?) sky thinking.\n\"A man in South Africa called me, very excited. He wanted to know if putting anthocyanins in chocolate would have the same effect.\n\"I told him, 'You can obtain the antioxidant function, but you don't have the same starch in chocolate, so it won't have the same reaction'.\"\nHere's hoping.\n ", "Warning labels on sugary drinks could deter parents": "For\n the study\n, researchers asked 2,381 parents to complete online surveys in which they selected a drink for their child from among 20  choices and answered questions about the healthiness of the beverages. Twelve beverages were considered sugar-sweetened because they had at least 75 calories from added sugars, and included sodas and juice drinks. The eight other drinks were water, juices and diet sodas.\nSome of the parents in the study viewed images of their sugary drink options that had health warning labels on the front of the bottle. The labels were based on wording in a proposed bill in California that would require labels stating, \"Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.\" Other parents saw a calorie label on the front of the bottle, which beverage companies in the United States display on bottles and cans voluntarily. For yet another group of parents, the drinks did not display calorie or health warning labels.\nThe researchers found that parents were less likely to choose a sugary drink for their child if those drinks had health warning labels. Forty percent of the parents who saw those labels went with the sugary drink option, compared with 53% of the parents who saw the calorie label and 60% of those who were given no labels.\n\"We are trying to make a link between the high sugar content and the calories and the actual downstream outcomes [of sugary drinks]. You can say that something has 18 or 24 grams of sugar, but most people have no clue what a gram is,\" said David Hammond, professor in the school of public health at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. \n\"[Health warning labels] provide an extra layer of information that people can understand,\" added Hammond, who led the research, which was published on Thursday in the journal Pediatrics.\nBills are under consideration in New York and California that would require sugar-sweetened beverages to feature health warning labels on their packaging, similar to tobacco warning labels in the United States and many other countries. San Francisco has passed a law, which has not gone into effect yet, that requires advertisements for sugary drinks to include warning labels. \nThis study suggests labels may have the intended effect to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks, and may also give policy makers the impetus to pass these bills, Hammond said. \nChanging parents' perceptions\nThe researchers focused on parents of children ages 6 to 11. There is particular concern about sugar consumption in young children because of the effects it could have on their health and nutrition, and the fact that it is training their palate from a young age to want sweets, Hammond said. It is important to look at how parents select foods for children in this age group because \"the typical 6- or 7-year-old is not walking into a store and buying their own beverage,\" Hammond said.\nThe study found that health warning labels on sugary drinks dissuaded parents not only from selecting one of the drinks during the survey, but also made them say they were less likely to buy these drinks in the future. In addition, the parents who saw the labels were more likely than the other parents to say sugary drinks were not healthy, would not help their child focus or feel energized and increased the risk of weight gain, heart disease and diabetes.\nThe researchers found that the California health warning label, as well as three variations of the label, were similarly effective in terms of what parents selected and their perceptions. One of the variations used the term weight gain instead of obesity, another specified type 2 diabetes as a potential outcome as opposed to diabetes in general, and the third described all three outcomes as preventable. \nThe study also suggests that parents want the information on labels. Out of all the parents in the study, 73% said they supported a government policy that required health warning labels on sugary drinks. \"[This] is encouraging for policy makers,\" Hammond said. \nHow labels could backfire\nSara Folta, assistant professor in the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, said she believes  there is a need to explain to parents about the health harms of sugary drinks. \"I think the issue is less about soda and more about sports drinks and other juice drinks that aren't 100% juice that parents perceive as maybe being healthy,\" said Folta, who was not involved in the study.\nHowever, Folta worries there could be potential for health warning labels to backfire, particularly among adolescents who might find it enticing to consume something that is bad for them. \n\"This research is a promising first step but we need to study [labels in other age groups] before a major policy is unveiled that could have unintended negative consequences for particular segments of the population,\" Folta said. \nAnother way health label warnings could fall short is if they are less accessible to people with less education. The study included people with a range of education based on degree level, and did not see a difference in the effect of health warning labels. However, by finding people willing to complete online surveys, it's possible the study inadvertently included a subset of the population that is better at reading and carrying out tasks, Folta said. \nThe impact of health label warnings could also wane, just like tobacco warning labels, because people become desensitized to them, said Hammond, who has carried about research on the effect of tobacco warnings. Many countries around the world, but not the United States, have tweaked these warnings over the years, making them bigger, more colorful and more graphic to keep their effect from wearing off. The same might have to be done for sugary drink labels, Hammond said.

Here is a gallery of women who have appeared on currency around the world.", "OkCupid adds feature for open relationships": "\"Couples Linking\" is a new feature that lets couples join their profiles. The feature is open to people who identify as \"seeing someone,\" \"married\" or \"in an open relationship\" and are looking for others to join their relationship. The feature will also help singles looking to join an open relationship by identifying non-monogamous couples in searches.\nThe addition was welcomed by many who identify as non-monogamous or polyamorous, terms broadly used to describe people openly involved in relationships with more than one person. These communities already consider OkCupid the most welcoming of the major dating sites for already having settings to accommodate them.\nPolyamory: Multiple partners, without jealousy\nPolyamorous people have trouble finding like-minded potential mates on most mainstream dating sites simply because there's no way to search for them, said sex educator Anita Illig Wagner, founder of \nPractical Polyamory\n. And, monogamous people don't always appreciate being approached blindly with an invitation into an open relationship.\n\"It's a very big deal and I'm delighted that OkCupid has gotten this far with it,\" she said. \"I hope other sites take it seriously and we find ourselves welcome in even more major websites.\"\nOkCupid made \"open relationship\" and \"non-monogamous\" options for relationship status in 2014 and added \n12 sexual orientation and 22 gender options\n, all believed to be firsts for a major dating site. \n\"You want to meet people like you so having the site identify you as non-monogamous is a very big deal,\" said Pepper Mint, a San Francisco-based  advocate for non-monogamy who organizes poly-friendly events.\nThe new feature also looks promising for \"couples dating,\" he said -- two people looking for someone together without having to create a joint profile.\nThere's no good measure of the amount of people who identify as non-monogamous or polyamorous because it's still a small group, Mint said. But as the concept becomes more well-known thanks to pop culture and politics more people are considering it for themselves.\n\"It's good news but it's not just OkCupid being generous,\" he added. \"It's well-known in the poly community that if you want to date online you go to OkCupid. What we're really seeing is non-monogamous purchasing power.\"\nOkCupid readily admits that the feature comes in response to growing interest among users in relationships with more than one person at a time, be it flings, casual hookups or committed relationships.\nOver the past five years the site has seen an increase in positive responses from users to questions about multiple partners, OkCupid chief product officer Jimena Almendares said. For example, in 2010, 39% of all users said \"I could be convinced by the right people\" when asked \"Would you consider being part of a committed polyamorous relationship?\"In 2015, people responding the same way to the same question rose by 6% among all users.\nAs for the question \"Would you consider dating someone who is already involved in an open or polyamorous relationship?\" 42% of all users said yes in 2010. In 2015, half of users said they would.\n\"Now, couples can identify themselves, and users searching for a non-monogamous relationship can find them more easily,\" Almendares said. \"Also, users searching for monogamous relationships only will not see profiles of users in non-monogamous relationships.\"\nThere's still room for improvement, Mint said. He would like to see \"polyamorous\" become a relationship status option. In the spirit of honesty and transparency that polyamory is predicated upon, being able to add more multiple partners to a profile would be another positive step forward, especially since many poly people don't seek out new mates as a couple.\n\"OkCupid has been making incremental changes and they're good but there's still farther to go,\" he said.", "Why your cat needs an iPad": "As with kids' toys and adults' favorite board games, diversions for pets have overwhelmingly gone digital.

States' \"right to work\" laws make it harder for unions to organize; meanwhile, technology and a changing economy challenge unions to sign up members working in increasingly complex businesses and decentralized locations.\nSo what can organized labor celebrate this Labor Day? \nFor their part, many unions are still run by people who don't look like the increasingly female, diverse and immigrant work force they want to represent. And they're not always using the latest technologies that today's younger workers use to communicate, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a senior lecturer at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations and director of labor education research.\nAs a result, membership numbers are down. In 1983, the country had 17.7 million members, a union membership rate of 20.1%. Last year, just 11.1% of workers were union members (14.6 million individuals), \naccording to Department of Labor statistics.  \nThough union participation is flagging, recent battles over fast food and Walmart workers, and a $15-per-hour minimum wage, are coming to the forefront -- a development that has some longtime labor experts floored. \n\"If you had asked any of us who study the labor movement, I don't think we could have imagined that workers would have been doing national strikes at fast food restaurants and Walmart, that those companies would have been the big campaign,\" Bronfenbrenner said.\nThis new wave of labor protests doesn't look like the old-fashioned automotive factory shutdowns of yesteryear, but the protests may be the new face of the working class. Keep an eye on these hot-button items over the next year. \nA $15 living wage. \nOrganized by the Service Employees International Union in a coalition with fast food workers and others, the Fight for $15 campaign has organized protests across the country focusing union members and nonmembers alike on a specific goal. As a result, in cities such as Seattle and Los Angeles, workers will eventually make a minimum wage of $15 per hour. Chicago raised its minimum to $13. Expect more protests like those in mid-April, which occurred in hundreds of cities across the country. \n\"Who would have thought a $15 minimum wage would be a reasonable thing to ask for?\" asked sociologist Jasmine Kerrissey, a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Labor Relations and Research Center. \"It was a started by the Fight for $15, which is basically SEIU and the fast food workers, who didn't have a union yet. A lot of people got excited, and it became a coalition.\"\n#BlackWorkMatters\n.\n While many members of the decentralized Black Lives Matter movement focus on police brutality and racial inequality, economic injustice is also part of the agenda for the founders and supporters. That should be no surprise, since Black Lives Matter co-founder\n Alicia Garza\n is the special projects director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. \nCharlene Carruthers\n, the national director of the Black Youth Project 100, is part of the $15 living wage campaign. Carruthers and other #BlackLivesMatters supporters use the #BlackWorkMatters hashtag to note economic inequality and promote economic opportunity for women and men of color as well as young people.\nBlack Thursday.\n While many retailers have opened very early on the Friday after Thanksgiving for years to host Black Friday sales, some stores have started to open on Thanksgiving itself to capture those early Christmas spending dollars. Target, Walmart and Kmart are among the bigger companies that have stayed open on the holiday. \nThough hospital workers and firefighters can expect to work the holiday, the notion that many low-wage workers would not have the day off in order for others to shop generated a backlash. More than 100,000 people have liked the \"Boycott Black Thursday\" Facebook page, and Change.org is filled with petitions protesting those retailers. Shoppers still pack the stores on holidays, but those opposed are applauding Nordstrom, Costco and other retailers that stay closed on Thanksgiving. \nOnline media\n. Young, savvy tech professionals are so post-modern that they wouldn't be interested a union, right? Wrong. The uncertain economy and irregular layoffs are concerning to the employees of digital media outlet Gawker, whose staffers voted in June to form a union under the auspices of the Writers Guild of America East, \nthe New York Times reported\n. They say they want better pay and benefits and improved communication with supervisors, but they don't want policies that restrict their hours. Gawker company officials didn't seem to object to the organizing effort, at least in public. \nVice Media followed suit in August, voting to join the same union. Staffers had some of the same interests as Gawker, but there was one aspect of the organizing campaign that was old-school: asking fellow staffers to remember the company founder's purchase of a $23 million mansion \"next time (management) says they can't afford to give us raises,\" \naccording to the Wall Street Journal.\nSafety in the air.\n Though some passengers might not worry about knives in the air, flight attendants -- many of whom had colleagues who died on September 11, 2001 -- do. \nThat's why the flight attendants were at the head of a coalition that succeeded in reversing a 2013 decision\n by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration that knives could be allowed on board. \nNext up: The flight attendants are \ntackling the issue of \"bleed air\" during flights\n, which they allege could be poisoning cabin crews. \nAdjunct professors organizing\n. As universities hire more part-time professors to teach their courses and those teachers report having to take other jobs or applying for food stamps to stay afloat, \nthe Service Employees International Union's Adjunct Action\n campaign is taking off. In the \nBoston area\n, part-timers at Boston, Tufts, Northeastern and Lesley universities voted to unionize. \nSo did part-time professors in California\n at Dominican University of California, Mills College, Otis College of Art and Design in Westchester and Whittier College. \nIt's not all unions\n. Many workers have created organizations to fight for better conditions and more control over their workplaces, but those organizations aren't necessarily unions. One of the biggest is\n Our Walmart\n, a nonprofit with current and former Walmart employees that organizes campaigns to influence company policy. But local centers have popped up everywhere from New Mexico to New York state. \nTemp workers unite!\n Or will they? An August 27 decision by the \nNational Labor Relations Board\n may open the floodgates to organizing by temporary workers and employees at franchise businesses. The decision \nrolled back a Reagan-era decision that strictly defined \"joint employers.\"\nWhat are those? Under the old rule, a company that subcontracted work to a temporary agency could be considered a joint employer with the agency if the company exercised \"direct and immediate\" control over the employees. \nThe board broadened the definition to include indirect forms of control. Many companies don't know what it means, which is why the decision will probably get litigated. \nIt could change the lay of the land for labor organizers. \nIf it sticks, it might affect McDonald's and other companies that work on a franchise model. (McDonald's doesn't own most of the McDonald's restaurants in existence. The company sells franchises to companies or individual owners, who hire their own employees to run the restaurants.)\nThat would mean unions that organize one franchise could also be allowed to negotiate with the parent company. And that's why fast food companies, hotels, franchise owners, temporary agencies and other businesses are crying foul at the decision and are promising to fight back. \nIt should make for an interesting year for a so-called dying movement.

Below is an edited version of their conversation.\nCNN: \nWhat's it like in the public housing projects where your kids live?\nDodson:\n It's a world removed. It's the thickest concentration of poverty that you could manufacture and condense. It's not just bad because of the obvious, like drugs, violence, guns. It's so bad because it's damn near impossible to get out of public housing. You're constantly surrounded by people who couldn't make it out. And so our kids are literally weighed down all the time. And they have to get on this bike and do all these amazing things. \nI told my kids this: When I was growing up, I had the room with posters of all these bike racers. I was surrounded by role models that I looked up to, who I wanted to be like. Here I am at 37 years old, and I get more inspiration from these kids because I know what they go through. And then to see what they're accomplishing, they make those guys in my room completely insignificant.\nCNN: \nYou are working to profoundly change these kids' lives.

It's very small, boots-on-the-ground, in the trenches, get-it-done type of work. We're scrappy. I think that's why it works.\nCNN:\n This seems to be more than a job for you.\nDodson:\n This is part of my life 24/7. It's the first thing I think about when I wake up; it's the last thing I think about when I go to bed. First thing I do every morning is check the news, looking for shootings in the neighborhood. If I see something, I start making calls or I just drive out there. I just did what was common sense, what seemed right. I feel like that's what my parents would've done.  \nYou've got to meet the kids where they are. It shows them, \"Look man, like, you're not going to hide. I'm not afraid of you.\" If you're not going to show up, I'm going to bang on your door. I've climbed up walls and opened second story windows to find a kid. You come in, and you're like a tracker trying to get these kids. You're just trying to hold them accountable. It shows a level of care that they're not used to.\nCNN:\n What does the future of Richmond Cycling Corps look like?\nDodson:\n We're moving all of our youth operations into a building that's only six-and-a-half blocks from where the majority of our kids live.

The concept of my gender was the first thing my mother learned about me, likely only a second after hearing my first cry. When doctors speak those words, they're correct for most babies. They weren't, in my case.\nFrom my earliest memories, I received little messages that told me I was different: I didn't like getting dirty. I wanted to be inside listening to music, or with my sister and mother. I was fascinated by Barbie. But I was constantly steered outdoors, \"where boys belong.\" My parents dressed me like a boy, so I wasn't a girl, right?\nI didn't know why I was different, but whatever it was, it wasn't acceptable. I learned to fake acting like other boys so I wasn't shunned or beaten at school. I knew my thoughts and emotions resembled those I saw displayed by other girls, but I didn't have the language to explain what was different or why.\nWe moved from San Francisco to rural Missouri when I was 10, and the bullying turned to gay bashing with horrible names and frequent beatings. \nAs a preteen, I made friendships with boys I didn't know were gay.

We were as fabulous as we imagined their lives had been, showing up to a Hollywood premier in a Bugatti Royale, complete with chauffeur. \nI found comfort in these friendships, but not because I was gay. I had huge crushes on girls, never once on a boy. We were bonded by our mutual \"otherness.\"\nWearing the mask of masculinity\nAs I grew older, I got better at making the \"mask of masculinity\" fit. I continually improved my public and private fa\u00e7ade, but even that created anxiety.\nI was 27 or 28 when I was first exposed to the concept of transgenderism. I think it was a PBS documentary. I didn't understand the difference between cross-dressing, drag queens and being transgender at the time.\nRead: Let transgender people achieve their American dream\nA couple of years later, I better understood the differences, but \"transgender\" still didn't quite fit. I had seen only transgender women who were attracted to men. I felt like I was the only person like me in the entire world.\nIt was another few years before I disclosed my secret to anyone. I met a lesbian who described feeling different from a young age. I shared my story, with which she identified. This chance disclosure to a stranger repeated itself a couple of times, but I still hid it from anyone close.\nBy my early 30s, I had two failed marriages and four sons. \"Are you sure you aren't gay?\" a girlfriend asked one day. I froze -- was I caught? \"Why would you think that?\" I asked. It was true that I was the one crying at the end of the movie while she sat on the other end of the couch, dry-eyed. It wasn't the only time she asked me. Women see subtle social clues that men don't, especially when they're intimately close. She knew something was different, but I still wasn't ready for honesty.\nRead: North Carolina transgender law: Is it discriminatory?\nI was 37 and working as an assignment editor at an Oklahoma TV station when I came out to a lesbian photographer at work. We became instant friends. She introduced me to her friends, and I felt like I had finally found my people! \"My girls,\" as I called them, would eventually grow from a small group of lesbians in Oklahoma to both lesbians and straight women around the world. These women loved me fiercely. With them, I could be myself, unmasked. I began experimenting with light makeup and going to lesbian bars. It was incredibly freeing to be seen as a woman, but I still wore the mask of masculinity in public.\nFor casual friends and co-workers -- the ones who saw the mask -- I was a source of negativity. I was living miserably, and just a few months after arriving at CNN in June 2013, I was ready to crack.\nI saw a doctor in the summer of 2014 because I wasn't sleeping, and was referred to a psychiatrist, and later a therapist. Up to this point, I had buried my dysphoria, terrified that acknowledging it automatically meant a transition, which meant losing my job, family and becoming homeless. I felt trapped, without options.\nRead: 'I'm not the Obamacare kid anymore'\nI'd never created a plan or attempted suicide, but I was very aware of the pills on my counter, enough of which would send me off to a never-ending slumber. According to a \n2014 study\n by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and National Center for Transgender Equality, a whopping 41% of transgender people admitted to attempting suicide. It's astronomical, compared to the 1.6% of the overall U.S. population who report a suicide attempt.\nThrough therapy, I realized that those frightening things weren't automatic, and that I really did have options. By the beginning of 2015, I took the first step. I gave myself permission, and began working on the second step, a timeline.\nComing out to family\nWhen I came out to my dad in August 2015, I was 48 and had started hormones four months before. We lost my mother in April. My sister had known for years, and we were both worried about how dad would handle the news. I began by telling him that I hoped the difficult news would bring us closer together. Fear of being a disappointment had fueled my secrecy since childhood, which had put a wall of separation between us.\nDad's response was something I never expected, but now realize I should have. I should have given him credit for all the loving things he had done for his family, all the sacrifices he had made. He told me he was shocked, but that he loves me and that wouldn't change. \"Everyone is different,\" he said. \"I know that, and I only want you to be happy.\" He instantly accepted me, without condition, and told me -- showed me -- just how much he loves me.\nMy sons, now 17, 19, 26 and 28,\n \nhave each had different reactions. What would they think it meant for them? I didn't want them to wonder if my being transgender was hereditary. Two aren't sure what to think yet, the other two are incredibly supportive. One close family member told me she didn't think she could call me Dani. Despite knowing her love for me, it stung a little.\nI don't speak to my first ex-wife. My second was shocked, but very supportive, much like my ex-girlfriends. One joked, \"That explains a lot,\" when I told her. My fear was that they would each look back on our intimacy and either be disgusted or wonder what it meant -- did this make them gay?\nComing out at work\nA few weeks later, I walked into a huddle of my co-workers and asked them to stay as their meeting came to a close. I was trembling, but reminded myself of how I'd felt before telling Dad.\nIn the middle of the main newsroom at CNN headquarters I began, \"I'm transgender and I've decided to medically transition.\" I gave them a shortened version of this story. I told them I'd decided months before to transition, and that they had probably noticed I was now less stressed and easier to be around. That brought a chuckle. It was obvious to them, how trapped and bottled-up I used to be. I told them how hormones had, and would, change me.\nI asked that on October 5 they begin using my new name and referring to me with female pronouns. I explained that I understood how difficult it is to begin thinking differently about someone else's gender, that they would make mistakes, but that there would be no scolding. That was a conscious departure from the shaming I see often on Twitter from some transgender people. While it's appropriate to have boundaries and not use a trans person's \"dead name\" or misgender them on purpose, mistakes are inevitable when you already know someone as a particular gender and name. I wanted my co-workers to see this as a positive, not as a \"gotcha\" opportunity.\nRead: Chris Mosier: The trans athlete making giant strides\nFinally, I told them that I didn't want them to feel pressured to have questions or responses right away. \"That's it. I'm just going to walk away now,\" I ended. But they stopped me, some with tears in their eyes. They immediately showed me their unconditional love with hugs, and in doing so, gave me relief, love, acceptance. Word spread throughout CNN and I began getting words of encouragement from co-workers I'd never met.\nThe road ahead\nThe same day I came out to co-workers, I paid the several hundred dollars to file a petition to change my name. As I walked out of the courthouse, I thought of the privilege I'd just experienced. Having the money to pay for a name change isn't something available to all trans folk. Many are involved in sex work and other dangerous activities in order to get hormones or even feed themselves. In a survey of 500 transgender people by the D.C. Trans Coalition, the group found that transgender people experience 10-20 times the rate of poverty, homelessness and assault as the average American.\nCurrently, I feel like a 12-year-old girl. I'm awkward and I don't \"pass\" as a woman. Half the time people \"sir\" me, half \"ma'am\" me. Some even double-take or correct themselves. Awkward!\nHormones don't make me cry any more or less, but now my emotions feel normal -- unmuted, not suppressed. My health insurance covers the cost of hormones and sex reassignment surgery, if I choose that. It doesn't cover facial feminization surgery, which some say is even more important to mental health, and even physical safety.\nRead: New York's lesson on safe bathroom access for all\nI avoid \nusing the restroom in public\n, when I can. It's a touchy subject. Many parents are concerned about their daughters using the restroom at school with a trans girl who has male anatomy. Many parents are concerned about their girls using the same restroom with an adult trans woman in public. I understand the source of the fear. We want children to be safe from danger, perceived or real, but I know of no trans woman who has ever attacked anyone in a restroom. Sadly, transgender folks get attacked, plenty.\nSo why did I do it? Why would I give up male privilege? The \ngender pay gap\n is very real. I don't want to be patronized by men. I place myself in danger by simply walking down the street or opting to use the ladies room. Public awareness of transgender individuals has risen with TV shows like the award-winning Amazon show \"Transparent\" and from Caitlyn Jenner coming out. \nYou might think the increased awareness would decrease the number of assaults against trans women, but transgender activists say assaults, especially against trans women of color, increased a whopping 62% in 2015 over the year before. Some 21 transgender people were killed in 2015, the most deadly year for transgender women since advocacy groups began keeping track. That's nearly double the 13 slain in 2014, but those numbers could be even higher.\nIn a \nreport\n from the LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, researchers said, \"These totals represent only the known victims; there may very well be countless other victims of fatal anti-transgender violence whose deaths we will never know about because police, the press or family members have consistently misidentified them based on their assigned sex and name at birth.\"\nI did it because it was either transition or lose my life. If I hadn't eventually attempted suicide, I'm sure the anxiety would have taken its toll. I did it because I no longer wanted to put on the mask of masculinity.\nThe relationships I have with my family and friends have dramatically improved. I recently told a co-worker that I used to say, \"If I died tomorrow, I would die the most fortunate and loved person I know.\" I asked her what was missing from that statement. It sounded pretty good, but there was one word missing. If I die tomorrow, I will die the most fortunate, most loved and happiest person I know.", "Minneapolis chefs serve up the next food trends": " But if you're lucky enough to sample some of the newest creations being whipped up by Minneapolis area chefs, you'll see why foodies from around the U.S. are saying this might be the next great food city in the country.  \n From the foie gras tostada at chef Gavin Kaysen's Spoon and Stable to the brioche and pork pizza at Pig Ate My Pizza, restaurants in this city have become as creative and unique as the dozens of hip neighborhoods they sit in. \n Longtime \nMinneapolis Star Tribune restaurant critic Rick Nelson\n says people shouldn't be surprised.  \"One of the things about the Twin Cities is that we're kind of in the middle of nowhere and we're surrounded by a lot of fertile farmland, so we've been doing a lot of farm to table for a long time. We have educated diners.\" \n Nelson also says restaurants and the enjoyment that comes with dining out is a result of people looking for an outlet during the cold winters. Plus, the city's affordability and strong quality of life are inviting to chefs and restaurateurs looking for a cheaper alternative to cities like Chicago and New York.  \n\"Entrepreneurs can come here and get a good start, and that's one of the reasons we have a great food truck scene,\" Nelson said.  \n One restaurant that may exemplify the spirit of the city's gastronomic identity as well as any is \nGyst Fermentation Bar \nin the Whittier neighborhood. Sisters and owners Ki and Mel Guse opened Gyst in 2015 just off a vibrant stretch of ethnically diverse eateries referred to by locals as \"Eat Street.\" \nAlong a two-block stretch alone, you're able to choose from such wildly different cuisines including Greek, Vietnamese, Caribbean and Mexican, all within steps of German mainstay Black Forest Inn, which has been serving up classics like schnitzel and Hungarian goulash for over half a century.\n The sisters settled on this spot as the place to introduce eaters to a selection of foods and wines that provide an education on fermentation as much as they offer dynamic flavors. Owner Mel Guse says the fermentation process helps create many of the foods we eat every day, something that may surprise people.\n \"My background is coming from wine and cheese and those are two of my favorite everyday fermented foods,\" she says. \"When you wake up and have a cup of coffee, the beans have to go through the process of fermentation before they are ever roasted.\" \nShe says other fermented foods include bread, cured salamis, chocolate, yogurt, beer, pickles and a wide range of vegetables from yellow beets to purple daikon radishes.\n Guse says that the Gyst menu, which includes dozens of beers and wines from local breweries as well as small wineries the sisters discovered in many countries including France, Lebanon and the Baltic Sea Republic of Georgia, also represents \"an adventure of thinking\" with foods produced locally and from small farms in other states and abroad. \nTrying new things to see what works and what doesn't is an attitude that helped create one of the restaurant's signature dishes. \n\"I was opening my fridge one day and all I had was an English muffin, some peanut butter and some (Korean) Kimchi from the Farmer's market. And I said I'll give it a try. And lo and behold it kind of works and it's kind of addicting,\" Guse says. The menu's current version of the sandwich uses a toasted focaccia roll and green scallion. \n Another eye-catcher is the Gyst \"Motherboard,\" which includes French brie, cow's milk blue cheese from Vermont, a type of wild onion called a ramp, a scarlet turnip that has been fermented with juniper berry, a young pecorino sheep's milk cheese, spicy Spanish chorizo sausage and lonza, a dry cured pork loin from a meat company in Northeast Minneapolis. \nThe array of vibrant food colors and their thoughtful placement on a large wood cutting board almost force you to take a picture of the dish before you begin eating it. \n And if you needed another reason to incorporate into your diet more fermented foods and the probiotics they include, Guse says it could help you with weight loss and improve overall health. \"More than anything eating fermented foods really helps with digestion and helps to give you that good belly, that gut.\"", "Online movement helps the homeless reconnect with family": "\"I used to be a carpenter,\" says Johns, who lives in Anchorage. \"There's a lot of ordinary people that can make a powerful impact in this world.\" \nDuring the winter, the temperatures in parts of Alaska can easily drop to minus 20 or lower. The frigid cold, along with the lack of daylight and mountains of snow, can be deadly for someone who is homeless. Samuel Johns knows all too well the dangers these individuals face. He has seen them with his own eyes.\nSo he decided to do something about it.\n\"I started \nForgetMeNotAK.org, a Facebook group page\n, to help the homeless reconnect with their families,\" says Johns.\nWithin six months after he started the movement, the Facebook page reached over 16,500 members. Johns says it is a community built on people who want to do good things for those in need.\nHow it works\nIf the homeless person agrees, his or her photo is posted on the\n Forget Me Not Facebook page\n, along with the person's name and other information. If someone recognizes the person, the group will provide as much information as possible to help the homeless person get back home.  \nThe group gives people who want to fight homelessness a way to do so in cyberspace. It also provides clothes and other resources to the homeless.\n\"We've already gotten people off of the street, but I can't bring everybody home. I can meet them and encourage them and let them know that they are loved,\" Johns said. \"I don't want to look at them in a bad way, you know. Instead of stereotyping them, I want to see what their stories are and treat them like human beings.\"  \nMusic brings people together\nAlthough Johns has never been homeless, he has had his share of personal struggles. He's a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for eight years. \n\"I found my outlet through music. That's what really helped me sober up,\" John says. Currently, he's trying to make it as an artist who blends hip-hop with his \nAthabascan\n (Native Alaskan) culture.  \nHe believes everyone can relate to music, and that's what he brings when volunteering at\n Bean's Cafe\n, a nonprofit organization that has been serving meals to the homeless in Anchorage since 1979.\nJohns serves up drumming and singing in his native language at Bean's and invites others to dance and sing along.\n\"It brings people back to their roots, to when they were young. It's like bringing them back to their true identity,\" says Johns. \"I think performing music makes people feel really good. That's what I like to do when I'm down here.\"", "Re-engineering the high heel": "", "Pioneering doctor heals wounds with spider silk": "", "Study: Don't be swayed by independent restaurants when trying to cut calories": "Non-chain restaurants are often seen as the healthier choice, even though -- or perhaps because -- the number of calories in their meals is a mystery. But a new study finds that these meals are generally just as calorie-rich as similar meals at chain restaurants.\nResearchers determined the calorie content of the most popular dinners at independent eateries around Boston, San Francisco and Little Rock, Arkansas. In each area, they included about a dozen restaurants across a range of cuisines, from American burger joints to Italian trattorias and Greek cafes.\nThe researchers determined the average dinner at a non-chain restaurant had about 1,200 calories, which they found was similar to comparable dinners at chain restaurants and around half of the daily energy requirement for adults. Women are recommended to consume about 2,000 calories a day to maintain their weight, whereas men can reach about 2,500 calories a day.\n\"Many nutritionists say fast food is making us obese, but that's just because they tell us their calories. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Non-chain restaurants are just as bad as chain restaurants,\" said Susan B. Roberts, director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Roberts led the research, which was published Wednesday in the Journal of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\"I think chain restaurants are better personally because you can make informed choices,\" she said.\nRoberts and her colleagues found a lot of variability between different types of cuisines. American, Italian, Chinese and Indian meals had the most calories on average, whereas Greek, Vietnamese and Mexican tended to have the fewest.\nAcross the range of cuisines, 92% of the dinners the researchers tested contained more than 570 calories, which they consider the appropriate number of calories for the average adult woman to consume at lunch and dinner. \"All of the popular choices have grossly excessive numbers of calories,\" Roberts said.\nOne of the unexpected findings for Roberts was that dishes she has recommended to her clients, such as grilled chicken tikka at Indian restaurants, were much higher in calories at some restaurants. \"They must be soaking the chicken in oil or yogurt because it has 200 or 300 more calories between restaurants,\" she said. It would be hard for consumers to notice the difference, she added. \nThe findings were surprising in general, said Marian Jarlenski, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study. \"The intuitive hypothesis is that non-chains would be healthier. This may be an American thing; we think local is better, and better in this case might be healthier,\" she said.\nJarlenski was particularly struck by the finding that meals with the smallest portion sizes were not necessarily low in calories. \"My personal strategy is to eat whatever I want as long as it's (a small portion), but I may be getting just as many calories if I'm ordering something that has a lot of calorie-dense ingredients,\" she said.\nWhat consumers can do\nThe number of calories served at a restaurant is an important issue because Americans eat out so much. One estimate is that the average American adult eats meals or snacks at restaurants about \nsix times a week\n. \"The weight of the evidence suggests that restaurant eating is a contributor to obesity in the United States,\" Jarlenski said.\n\"Consumers should be aware to eat out in moderation ... restaurant eating is most likely not going to be as healthy as cooking with fresh ingredients at home,\" Jarlenski said. \nFor her part, Roberts thinks that advising people not to eat out so much is like \"telling the tide not to rise.\" \"People like eating out, and it's likely to become even more frequent. We need ways to help people deal with it better,\" she said.\nOne of the easy things that consumers can do is ask for cheese and dressing on the side when they order. \"You can just sprinkle a little on. A lot of the calories come from these high-calorie add-ons,\" Roberts said.\nIt is also possible to curb how much you eat and get a doggie bag for leftovers, but many of us do not have this kind of willpower.  \n\"The easiest solution is if you say up front (to the server), 'I'd like to take a half-portion and you can give me the other portion to take home,' but it's kind of embarrassing unless you know the people you eat out with well,\" she said.\nShould non-chain restaurants post calorie information? \nAlthough it may help consumers to get calorie information at independent restaurants just like at chain restaurants, \"I don't think simply disclosing (this information) is going to have a huge effect,\" Roberts said. Although it could steer some toward lower-calorie options, people with less money may order the largest number of calories they can afford, she said.\nIn addition, \"providing the caloric content information might affect restaurant behavior rather than consumer behavior,\" such as spurring restaurants to make their meals healthier or make their portions smaller, Jarlenski said.\nRoberts says the impact of restaurants offering smaller portions -- such as half- or third-portions, for half or a third of the price -- should be explored. \"Restaurants will say, 'We can't possibly do that,' but if everyone were required (by law) to do that, the playing field (would be) level,\" she said. \"I would eat out every night of the week if I could do that.\" \nAlthough Roberts doubts the calorie load at non-chain restaurants in other parts of the United States would be much better, it is hard to say how eateries in other cities and in rural areas would stack up.\nThe three cities in the study -- Boston, San Francisco and Little Rock -- differ in their demographics and their obesity rates. \n\"I would have thought that San Francisco (restaurants) would be better than Boston and Little Rock ... because San Francisco is one of the lowest-BMI cities,\" Jarlenski said.\nThat just goes to show that many other factors, in addition to calories in restaurant food, contribute to obesity rates, such as how often people go out to eat and how much exercise they get, she added.\nFollow CNN Health on \nFacebook\n and \nTwitter", "What's still made in America": "But that doesn't mean American-made products no longer exist.

The kids are OK, study says": "An apples to apples comparison\nDr. Nanette Gartrell\n, one of the study's authors, said the aim was to do a real population-based, apples to apples comparison. \"It is the only study to compare same-sex and different-sex parent households with stable, continuously coupled parents and their biological offspring,\" said Gartrell. This study tried to compensate for the shortcomings of previous studies, which recruited same-sex parent families and could thus establish a certain selection bias. \"It's been a goal of ours to do a nationally representative survey in which we could do this very carefully matched study,\" she said \nUsing the \nNational Survey of Children's Health \non emotional and physical well being, Gartrell and her colleagues matched 95 same-sex female parent households to 95 different-sex parent based on the following characteristics: \nParents' age\nParents' level of education \nWhether parents were born in the United States\nFamily residence (urban or rural)\nChild's age\nChild's race\nChild's gender \nWhether the child was born in the United States or elsewhere\nNo differences in children's outcomes\nThe study found that there were no differences in the children when it came to their general health, their emotional difficulties, their coping behaviors and their learning behaviors. What the study found to be more indicative predictors of these behaviors were the relationships between the parents, the parents and child, and parenting stress. \nThe study did note that lesbian parents seem to exhibit higher levels of parenting stress, which Gartell attributed to perceived homophobia. \"Parents feel pressured to justify the quality of their parenting more than their heterosexual counterparts. We also suspect and feel that more study is warranted, but the cultural spotlight on same-sex parenting may be part of the stress,\" she said. \nThose against same-sex parenting have pointed to \nstudies\n that have found gay parents to have a negative impact on childhood outcomes, such as lower levels of income, and poorer mental and physical health\nGartell said studies like those didn't compensate for the fact that they were comparing children from same-sex couples who were not continuously coupled. Rather, those studies looked at children from same-sex families who experienced family upheaval such as divorce, adoption or foster care and compared them to children from stable households with different-sex parents. \nThe current study only looked at lesbian households, because when households were finally matched and controlled for continuous relationships, there were too few male same-sex households. \nGartrell said this is by no means the final study to be done on same-sex parenting. \"We still have so much to learn and find out about different types of families,\" she said. ", "Keep calm and TSA on, a how to guide for long airport line rage": "Travel can be a pain even in the best of times, and bottlenecks at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints are making things even worse than usual. This summer, air travel is expected to draw the most people ever, with 220 million expected to fly. And officials say the problem won't ease until at least mid-June.\nWhether you need to travel for business or enjoy traveling for pleasure, not ruining your trip right off the bat requires some planning, determination and the ability to just let go.\nHow can you keep calm? Let's start by taking a deep breath and counting backward from five:\n5. Arrive early\nThe easiest thing you can do to alleviate stress is get to the airport early. For years, airlines have advised arriving one hour before a domestic flight and two hours before an international flight. Now, just to be on the safe side, you might want to double that. In fact, just this week, Chicago airports recommended a three-hour cushion for security lines. By just about everyone's standards, this is mind-boggling -- and longer than most people's flights.\nIf you do manage to clear security quickly, don't consider the time wasted. There are plenty of things you can do while you wait to board your flight.\n4. Be productive\nWaiting for a flight is a great time to play catch-up on everything from email and text messages to your favorite shows on demand. While most airports offer free or paid Wi-Fi, the pro tip is to download everything you want to watch before you leave home. Even if you can establish a connection, it is oftentimes too slow to download an entire movie before boarding -- and too slow to stream once you're on the plane.\nMake sure all your batteries are fully charged. One thing many experienced travelers never leave home without is a rechargeable battery pack (or a few) to provide their phone, tablet or computer with some extra juice. Unless you're sitting in first class or premium economy, chances are you won't have a plug at your seat. Even before you get on the plane, this will save you from standing idly by at a charging station or sitting on the floor to plug into the wall.\n3. Exercise\nWhile many travelers like to think of their time on the road as a time to break their diet with a juicy burger or a greasy slice of pizza, others pine for the opportunity to get some exercise. Though you probably don't want to work up a sweat before you board your flight -- and the person sitting next to you would thank you for not doing that, either -- you can go for a brisk walk through the terminal to get your steps for the day.\nThink about the amount of time you're going to spend sitting on the plane. If you don't want to be that creepy person pacing up and down the aisle, it's a good idea to get in your exercise while you can.\n2. Chill out\nIf relaxing better suits your travel style, you're going to want to find a space away from the endless announcements, screaming babies and ringing cell phones.\nUnfortunately, some true airport calm usually comes with a price tag.\nAirline lounges arguably offer the best bang for your buck. For a yearly fee -- or a day rate -- you'll get access to a little oasis, away from the masses. Included in the price at most lounges is food, drink and entertainment, not to mention a clean(er) bathroom. And can you really put a price tag on that?\nIf you've got a little more time to kill, consider a quick therapy at a spa. It might be a strange notion to sit down for a massage in plain view of thousands of strangers, but you'll feel better for it.\n1. Zen out\nSensory overload: two great words to describe an airport. Surely, you can think of a few others.\nTry seeking out the multifaith chapel. In most locations, electronic devices are banned -- and it's the only place in the airport to silence flight announcements.\nEven if you're not religious, you could find something of a spiritual experience here.\nIf you can't find actual peace and quiet, you can still create your own. If the price tag on noise-canceling headphones is too steep, consider downloading a white noise app or album. Some of the best tracks are made to help babies sleep (try \"Natural White Noise for Babies: Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night\"). Once you've tuned out your surroundings, go within.\nFind an area out of the way where you won't get bumped around and close your eyes. Take deep breaths, equal length inhalations and exhalations. Try to extend the duration of your breaths, breathing in and out longer and deeper. Guaranteed, you'll be surprised just how well -- and how quickly -- this works.\nFor even greater relaxation: meditate. It's no longer just for the nutty crunchy hipster yogis among us. It can have a profound calming and clearing effect on your body and your brain.\nTwo of the simplest forms of meditation involve repetition. Numbers, for example. To yourself, say \"one\" every time you inhale and \"two\" every time you exhale. Breath in and out slowly, repeating \"one, two, one, two.\" Try it for just one minute, and you're sure to feel more relaxed.\nAlternatively, choose just one word or thought to repeat over and over while you concentrate on your breathing. Pick a word like \"calm,\" \"peace\" or \"serenity\" and visualize it. Before you know it, you'll be boarding and on your way to your destination.\nSafe travels!", "Queer black millennial who's shaking up Georgia politics": "It concerned \nGeorgia's \"religious freedom\" bill\n, a piece of legislation that she said would lead to discrimination against \ngay and transgender people\n.\n\"Wouldn't it be true that if this bill is passed, as amended, that in a domestic violence situation, in a same-sex couple, that person could be denied care?\" Cannon asked on March 16.\n\"And of course, their answer was yes,\" she said in an interview.\nThat night, the Georgia General Assembly passed the bill, leaving its fate to Gov. Nathan Deal, who announced Monday that \nhe will veto it\n.\nCorporations including Disney, 20th Century Fox and Time Warner (CNN's parent company) had \nurged Deal to veto the legislation\n. Some even threatened to take their business out of state if the bill became law.\nBut financial concerns aside, Cannon focused on the human toll of the religious liberty bill. It's legislation like this, she said, that spurred her bid for office.\n \nA different point of view\nCannon is young. She is a black woman. She is queer.\nThat's what Democratic Rep. Karla Drenner said makes Cannon's perspective special to the Georgia Democratic caucus.\n\"She definitely looks at the world differently than most members,\" said Drenner, who is also an openly gay lawmaker. \"The difference is that she identifies with the word 'queer.' I think that's generated some discussion because a lot of members have no clue what 'Q' means.\"\nCannon, 24, said she made the decision to identify as queer because it's an inclusive descriptor. The term, which can represent gay, lesbian, asexual, intersex and transgender people, among others, used to be a derogatory one, but Cannon and others are reclaiming it. \n\"I think 'queer' is a term like other terms that is evolving even within my community, on my street, in the neighborhood. There are just different portrayals of it,\" she said. \nCannon was sworn in February 22 after winning a runoff vote for the District 58 seat.\nShe hopes to represent a mixed group of voices who feel underrepresented: women, African-Americans, young people, intersex people, lesbians, asexual people, transgender people.\n\"It doesn't get us anywhere to cut people down,\" she said. \"I do think that there is the importance of speaking about (identity) but not detract from the rest of the issues.\"\nCannon is one of three openly gay lawmakers in the Georgia House and its youngest. \nThrough her work with social justice nonprofits and women's health clinics, she has advocated for women's reproductive rights and access to public education. She pulls from her own experiences to try to change how decisions are made in the state's conservative legislature.\nAlong the way, she's becoming a role model, said Deborah Scott, her mentor and executive director of Georgia Stand Up, a social justice organization where Cannon interned in 2014.\n\"She's fighting for minimum wage, affordable health care,\" Scott said. \"These are issues that are affecting not just Georgia but women everywhere. It's nice to know that there is someone in our younger generation that is championing for women's rights.\"\nWith 60 Democrats, 118 Republicans and one independent in the state House, conservative voices are loud, especially the night H.B. 757 passed.\nRead H.B. 757, the Free Exercise Protection Act (PDF)\n\"They double our voices, which is not a happy feeling,\" Cannon said. \nShe points to the wall in the House chamber that shows the names of the representatives and how they vote.\n\"Seeing the names that were intentionally allowing the state to discriminate against people -- I mean, an entire class of people. We have not restricted rights for people since Jim Crow. I just really hope that the people who voted that way are clear about what they did,\" Cannon said. \"I truly felt like it was a day of violence.\"\nNot just a small-town girl\nCannon doesn't see her upbringing any differently from those of her peers.\nShe grew up on a military base in Albany, Georgia; her father was a Vietnam veteran and her mother a pharmaceutical representative.\nCannon majored in linguistics and minored in women's and gender studies at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, which has helped with her role as a representative.\n\"It's all about communicating with others, whether it's during language acquisition or just verbal communication,\" Cannon said. \"We have to do a lot of that down here at the Capitol.\"\nBefore North Carolina, Cannon experienced firsthand how powerful words can be.\nShe initially enrolled at Chapman University in California. At one point during her first few weeks, Cannon heard furious knocking on her dorm room door. When she opened it, the word \"n*****\" was written all over it, she said.\nShe confronted the two people who she believed did it and filed a report with the university. After the complaint was addressed, Cannon moved back home to Georgia. \n\"It wasn't the social climate I was hoping for,\" Cannon said.\nThat experience catalyzed her interest in the treatment of different groups of people. So when Cannon reads bills about asserting English as the language of the state, she thinks about the message it might send: that Georgia is unwelcoming to people who don't speak English.\n\"I definitely want to be a part of the welcoming party,\" Cannon said.\nA day at the Capitol\nBefore she leaves her house in Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward each morning, Cannon always makes time to do yoga, even if it's for five minutes.\nShe starts her workday before 10 a.m., checking emails and meeting with her fellow Democrats before hearing legislation in the House until 2 p.m. \nMeeting visitors at the Capitol makes the day go by faster, and many young people gravitate to her.\nOn March 17, Cannon walked into the Capitol and ran into a group of Westchester Elementary School students. Instantly, the children circled her, excited to meet a lawmaker.\n\"Does anyone have a question for a representative?\" Cannon asked the group.\nThe students' hands shot up. They wanted to know what the job is like.\n\"I have to read a lot. It's a lot of different words that I don't always know. So I have to ask people to help me,\" Cannon said.\n\"Why did you run for office?\" a student asked.\n\"I was really sad about the things that were happening in the environment, in my community, so I decided to make a change,\" Cannon replied.\nDrenner notes that the things that set Cannon apart go beyond being black and queer. Most lawmakers are baby boomers, while Cannon is a millennial who speaks openly on issues that her older colleagues may be more reserved about. \nStill, Cannon appears cautious as she consults with her fellow caucus members to ensure that she is leaving the right impression with people outside the legislature.\n\"She's the new kid on the block, so she's just finding her way around with the various members,\" Drenner said. \nThe religious freedom bill may have been the first occasion Cannon used her microphone to speak on a controversial bill, but she said it won't be the last. She feels strongly about affordable housing, environmental awareness and abortion rights.\n\"We have had an increase in anti-choice legislation over the years, and it has been coming from the South,\" Cannon said. \"It has been coming from places where I live, where I want to protect.\"", "The Other Side: Where do amazing coincidences come from?": "He was a Texas Ranger, patrolling the Rio Grande in 1940, when he got lost in a canyon after dark. He tried to climb out but lost his balance just as he neared the top of a cliff. Suddenly Joe, a fellow Ranger, appeared and hoisted him up to safety with his rifle strap. Burton thanked Joe for saving his life but lost contact with him after both men enlisted in the military during World War II.\nBurton was in the middle of sharing his story when an elderly man appeared in the doorway. It was Joe, the fellow Ranger. He had tracked Burton down 25 years later and walked into his classroom at precisely the moment Burton was recounting his rescue.\n\"I'll have Joe finish the rest of the story,\" Burton said, without missing a beat as the astonished classroom witnessed the two men's reunion.\nYou could call Burton's story an amazing coincidence, but James Hollis calls it something else: \"synchronicity\"  -- a meaningful coincidence.\nSynchronicity is a term coined by Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and mystic. It is the occurrence of two events that have no apparent cause and effect relation but are nonetheless connected by meaning, often in profound ways.\nSynchronicity is an odd term, but it's a familiar experience to many people. Someone dreams of a childhood friend he hasn't heard from in years and gets a phone call from that friend the next day. Another person loses his mother and hears her favorite song on the radio on the day of her funeral. Someone facing a terrible personal crisis is the accidental recipient of a book that seems written just for him or her. \n\"Everybody has stories like that,\" says Hollis, a Jungian analyst and author who knew Burton and shares his story in the book \"Hauntings: Dispelling the Ghosts Who Run Our Lives.\" \"We live in a haunted world where invisible energies are constantly at work.\"\nYet few people understand how synchronicities work. Why do they happen, where do they come from, and does their existence suggest that everyone's life is somehow part of some cosmic drama shaped by unseen hands?\nOr, as critics insist, is synchronicity simply psychological narcissism, the result of a person's desperate need to find meaning in odd connections that anyone would notice if he paid attention.\nThose are the kind of questions that scientists, skeptics and psychologists have long asked about striking coincidences. The concept of synchronicity, though, is moving mainstream. Google the term and 5.4 million references pop up. Facebook has a page devoted to synchronicity. And there are people who collect synchronicity stories like kids used to collect baseball cards. They catalog them in pieces such as \"\n29 Mind-Blowing Coincidences You Won't Believe Happened\n\" or \"\n20 Amazing Coincidences.\n\"\nEven those who have never heard of synchronicity are influenced by it, some say. If you flip open the Bible and randomly pick out the first Scripture you see for guidance, or you pay attention to premonitions or astrology, you are relying to some degree on the principles of synchronicity.\n\"The interest in synchronicity is exploding,\" says Gibbs A. Williams, a psychoanalyst and author of the book \"Demystifying Meaningful Coincidences.\"\n\"Many synchronicity disciples get off on this stuff as if they were junkies craving their next fix.\" \nOf plum pudding and golden beetles\nSynchronicity groupies have their favorite stories. Some have been cited so much it's difficult to know if they're true or apocryphal -- or a combination of both.\nConsider the infamous tale of Emile Deschamps and his plum pudding.\nIn 1805, Deschamps, a French poet, was treated to plum pudding by Monsieur de Fortgibu, a stranger he met in a restaurant. A decade later, Deschamps goes to a Paris restaurant and orders plum pudding again. The waiter tells him the last dish has been served to someone else -- a Monsieur de Fortgibu.\nThe story gets odder. In 1832, Deschamps goes to a diner where someone offers him plum pudding. He jokingly tells his friends that the only thing missing is de\n \nFortgibu -- and de Fortgibu, now an elderly man, promptly wobbles into the diner.\nNo wonder Jung was drawn to such stories of synchronicity. He was fascinated by strange experiences. He was a lifelong believer in the occult and claimed to have personal encounters with the paranormal.\nJung's belief in synchronicity was, in fact, reinforced by a synchronistic encounter that was as eerie as Deschamps' plum pudding story.\nJung was treating a highly educated young woman who he thought relied too much on her intellect. He said she was \"psychologically inaccessible\" and concluded that a breakthrough could only come if something unexpected and irrational turned up during their sessions.\nOne day the woman told Jung she had a strange dream the night before in which someone had handed her an expensive piece of jewelry, a \"golden scarab\" shaped like a beetle. While the woman was sharing the dream, Jung heard a gentle tapping on an office window behind him. It was a large insect trying to get into the darkened office.\nJung opened the window and caught the insect when it flew in. It was a golden scarabaeid beetle, whose gold-green color resembled the color of the golden scarab jewelry. \n \"Here is your scarab,\" Jung said, handing it to the stunned woman.\nThe moment proved to be a breakthrough for the woman, Jung claimed. His decision to use the synchronistic moment to forge a breakthrough with his patient would become a model for other Jungian therapists. Their message: Synchronistic moments don't happen just to inspire wonder; they arrive to force people to reconsider their values.\nWhy synchronicity happens\nWhenever an improbable coincidence occurs, says Hollis, the Jungian analyst, people should look for the possible message in that moment.\n\"We should ask if there is another dimension to it (the striking coincidence) that would ask of me, what change of attitude and what insight I might draw from this,\" he says. \"Is there a task there that is corrective to my way of looking at things?\"\nIn his book \"Hauntings,\" Hollis explained the message behind the former Texas Ranger's improbable reunion. Hollis befriended him when both taught at the same university.\n\"For my colleague, who is a sensate 'facts are facts kind of guy,' the incident helped expand his psychic life by bringing a bit of mystery into it,\" Hollis wrote. \"After his sensibility enlarged, he was even more aware of the presence of invisible energies amid his tangible world.\"\nSome believe that people can train themselves to summon synchronistic moments.\nAlex Marcoux, author of \"Lifesigns: Tapping the Power of Synchronicity, Serendipity and Miracles,\" says that the \"Universe\" sends synchronistic signs to help people live more fulfilling lives. Marcoux, who insists that Universe be capitalized because of her spiritual beliefs, offers a five-step process on how to recognize and learn from synchronicity: Ask with intention, sense life's experiences, unravel the Universe's clues, validate the answer and express gratitude.\nMarcoux says she's relied on synchronistic moments to help her make decisions on everything from the plotlines of her novels to her finances and relationships.\nWhen asked how she can discern if a coincidence is a message or just a random moment, she says there are three indicators: The event is meaningful, improbable and she's hit with a sudden realization. The moment feels like an epiphany.\n\"The hair goes up on the back of your neck,\" she says.\nJung introduced the concept of synchronicity to Western audiences with the publication of his book \"Synchronicity -- An Acausal Connecting Principle.\" But the concept predates him by thousands of years. As Jung pointed out, the concept forms the foundation for an ancient Chinese text used for divination called the I Ching, or the Book of Changes. Jungians say advances in quantum physics and chaos theory also reinforced the principles of synchronicity.  \nWhy synchronicity could be a hoax\nSome critics say synchronicity is not the result of an otherworldly influence. It's self-generated -- it's produced by people looking for answers to personal problems, says Williams, author of \"Demystifying Meaningful Coincidences.\"\nWilliams says synchronicities are neither random events nor coded messages from a transcendent divinity. Striking coincidences often occur when people are experiencing a psychological gridlock in their life.\nA person who swears off drinking, for example, may turn on the television set the same day of their resolution and see a movie about Alcoholics Anonymous. When one resolves to solve a personal problem, one will often see a \"resonant message\" embedded in a moment, he says.\n\"You're looking for patterns. It's like you're on your own psychological scavenger hunt. You look for pieces to fit the puzzle. The completed pattern is experienced as a synchronicity.\"\nSome critics of synchronicity deny these events occur at all.\nSkeptics cite one of the most frequently touted examples of synchronicity: the strange parallels between Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.\nBoth presidents had seven letters in their last names and were elected to office 100 years apart -- 1860 and 1960. Both were assassinated on a Friday in the presence of their wives, Lincoln in Ford's Theatre and Kennedy in an automobile made by Ford. Both were felled by assassins who went by three names, John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald. And both were succeeded by vice presidents who were Southern Democrats with the last name Johnson.\nWhat does it mean?\nAbsolutely nothing, wrote Bruce Martin in an essay for Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Mathematical probability ensures that some coincidences will occur, but people assign less probability to coincidences than they deserve. Probability ensures that in a random selection of 23 people, he says, there is a 50% chance that at least two of those people celebrate the same birth date.\nSynchronicity supporters also ignore facts that challenge the meaning of their coincidences, he says. Take Lincoln and Kennedy: They shared similarities, but they were also born and died in different months, states and at different ages. What about those differences?\n\"For any two people with reasonably eventful lives it is possible to find coincidences between them,\" Martin wrote in the essay \"Coincidences: Remarkable or Random?\"\n\"Two people meeting at a party often find some striking coincidence between them, but what it is -- birthdate, hometown, etc. -- is not predicted in advance.\"\nHollis, the Jungian analyst, readily concedes some coincidences exist apart from synchronicity. But he says there are other odd coincidences that go beyond mathematical possibility. You just can't explain them away. He says these strange stories reveal \"the spectral presence\" of some kind of energy that deliberately infiltrates people's daily lives.\nConsider one of the strangest synchronicity stories ever told:\nIn 1938, Joseph Figlock, a street sweeper, was cleaning an alley in Detroit when a baby fell from an open, fourth-floor window. The baby hit Figlock in the head, the impact saving the child's life. A year later, Figlock was sweeping another alley when another baby fell from a fourth-floor window -- onto Figlock. Same fate. Both Figlock and the baby were unharmed.\nWhat does one make of such a story?\nTime magazine matter-of-factly reported Figlock's story under the headline, \"Coincidence in Detroit.\" It did not include any interviews -- and the story is one the Internet loves to debate as truth or fiction. This much appears to be sure: No one ever caught up with Figlock or either of the babies to see how their lives were shaped by those amazing moments.\nTry to explain why these coincidences occur, and few agree. Even Jung struggled to grasp the implication of synchronicity -- some say he had at least three different definitions of it, and his followers disagreed about its meaning.\nSays Williams, the disbeliever: \"I don't think anyone has had a bead on the absolute truth.\"\nSo what are we left with? Puzzling stories of falling babies, plum pudding and odd coincidences that can shape people's lives -- and even haunt them.", "Going to church could help you live longer, study says": "Researchers looked at data on nearly 75,000 middle-age female nurses in the United States as part of the Nurses' Health Study. The participants answered questions about whether they attended religious services regularly every four years between 1992 and 2012, and about other aspects of their lives over the years.\nThe researchers found that women who went to church more than once a week had a 33% lower risk of dying during the study period compared with those who said they never went. Less-frequent attendance was also associated with a lower risk of death, as women who attended once a week or less than weekly had 26% and 13% lower risk of death, respectively.\nWomen who regularly attended religious services also had higher rates of social support and optimism, had lower rates of depression and were less likely to smoke. However, the researchers took into account these differences between churchgoers and non-churchgoers when they calculated the decrease in death rates of 13% to 33%. \nGoing to church could have a number of additional benefits that could, in turn, improve longevity, but the researchers were not able to examine them with the available data. Attendance could promote self-discipline and a sense of meaning and purpose in life, or it could provide an experience of the transcendent, said Tyler J. VanderWeele, professor of epidemiology in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. VanderWeele led the new research, which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\"Our study suggests that for health, the benefits outweigh the potentially negative effects,\" such as guilt, anxiety or intolerance, VanderWeele said.\nMost of the women in the study were Protestant or Catholic, so it is not clear whether a similar association would be found between religious service attendance and longevity for people of other Christian religions, Judaism or Islam. \nThe study also did not explore the association in men. Previous research suggests that male churchgoers also benefit, though their decrease in death rate is not as large as among women, VanderWeele said.\n\"There have been literally thousands of studies\" looking at whether religion is good for your health, said Dr. Dan German Blazer II, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center. The findings have been mixed about whether aspects of religious devotion such as prayer and spirituality -- such as reading the Bible or other religious literature -- improve longevity.\n\"The one (aspect) that is significantly more predictive of good health is about religious service attendance,\" said Blazer, who wrote an editorial about the new study in the same issue of JAMA Internal Medicine. \nMost people report that they are spiritual, and it is possible that actually attending religious services is good for their health because they are taking actions that are in line with their beliefs, Blazer said. \"You have a more integrated life in this sense.\" However, this explanation is purely speculative, and studies have not explored this theory, he added. \nThe suggestion that attending religious services regularly could boost longevity has met with some criticism in the field. Other researchers have pointed out that the relationship could be due to other factors, such as the possibility that healthier people are more likely to go to church, perhaps because they are more mobile. \nThe main strength of the current study is that the researchers were able to look at whether participants reported attending religious services at several points over many years, making it easier to find out which came first, religious activity or disease and health outcomes, Blazer said. \nNevertheless, Blazer warns that it is important not to make too much of the new findings. \"This study does not suggest that clinicians prescribe attending religious services as a way to be more healthy,\" he said. It was not meant to assess going to church as an actual medical intervention.\nOn the other hand, the study does suggest that \"clinicians who know their patients well and follow them over a period of time, like primary care doctors, inquire when it is appropriate about their religious beliefs and practices,\" Blazer said. That way, if patients say that attending religious services is important to them, the doctor can help ensure that they maintain a good relationship with their church, temple or mosque. \nThis attitude about the place of religion in medical care is becoming more common among health care professionals and has been introduced into the curriculum of more and more medical schools, Blazer said. ", "Female commander is a first for Texas A&M": "The cadets fall into perfectly symmetrical lines and salute their leader. The faint sound of a bugle carries over a speaker. The commander yells orders, and each block marches into a dining hall. \nThis is not a military academy; it's Texas A&M University, and the men and women who line up for formation twice a day in perfectly pressed uniforms are part of the Corps of Cadets, a student military group being led for the first time in its 140-year history by a woman, 21-year-old Corps Commander Alyssa Michalke. \nWhen asked what it means to be the first woman to lead the Corps, she is deferential. \n\"I can guarantee you there have been women before me who were more deserving of the position than I was,\" she said, the badges she's earned glimmering on her uniform. \"But it was just because they weren't in the right place at the right time ... or there was a more qualified male individual who took the spot.\"\nIt's hard to think of what could make Michalke more qualified to lead this group of 2,400 students. She was valedictorian of her high school class in Schulenberg, Texas. Now, in her senior year of college, she has an above-average GPA while double majoring in civil and ocean engineering -- where she is again one of few women in the room. She plays softball and basketball and has earned leadership positions each year within the Corps. \nSteeped in tradition\nThe Corps has historically been mostly male and was even a requirement for anyone who wished to attend Texas A&M in its early, all-male days. Even now, with the school co-ed since the 1960s and the Corps accepting women for the past 40 years, only 15 percent of its members are women. The pattern of a male-dominated Corps has been hard to break in this school that is steeped in tradition.\nThe school is so passionate about its traditions that, even though Texas A&M no longer plays its archnemesis University of Texas in football, students still sing a 100-year-old fight song that centers around \"goodbye to the orange and the white.\" The schools haven't played each other in football since 2011, when Texas A&M left the Big 12 for the SEC.   \nBut with time, even the strongest traditions make a shift. And this school year, it was selecting Michalke to lead the Corps. She says she wasn't surprised to hear about resistance when she was named commander.\n\"We still have some of the people with the 'good old boy' attitude, who don't necessarily respect women in leadership positions,\" she said. \"I put a lot of time and effort into working as hard as I could making sure that this year ran as smoothly as possible so they couldn't point to a female leader being the root of all problems.\"\nAnd she certainly puts in a lot of time, clocking only about four hours of sleep a night so she can juggle her full class load, her Corps duties and her role shaping the path of the Corps; one of her goals this year is to raise the cadets' average GPA.\nWhile she and other women fight to make change in the group, the rest of the campus of about 60,000 students carries on with trends of the moment. Students in skinny jeans Snapchat on their iPhones, their ears covered in Beats by Dre headphones. Mixed into that crowd are the cadets, as if from a lost era, clad in Vietnam-era military uniforms and not allowed to use cell phones while walking on campus in uniform. \nNot a feminist \nThe impact of Michalke's rise on other campus women is already apparent. In February, the board of students and former military officers who elect each year's Corps commander selected another woman to succeed Michalke: Cecille Sorio. \nSorio says Michalke paved the way for her and for other women in their group.\n\"When people found out that a woman would be leading a Corps of almost 2,400 people, they were taken aback, because it wasn't the image they were used to,\" Sorio said. \"Looking back at what she's done with the Corps, it's made a lot of positive progress. She's made a good name for change.\"\nEven outside the Corps, seeing a woman picked to lead a predominantly male group piqued the attention of then-sophomore Hannah Wimberly. \nWimberly, a human resource development major, was inspired to run for student body president, partially because of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's book \"Lean In\" (\"my favorite book in the whole world\") and partially because of Michalke.\n\"Having her around is definitely something that gives me more confidence,\" she said. \"It's led other women (on campus) to say, 'I can accomplish my goals,' because they've seen Alyssa do the same thing.\" \nWimberly, now 21, was elected to be the campus' first female student body president in 15 years. \nSome would call this sea change a feminist coup, yet Michalke doesn't see herself in those terms.  \n\"I can't say that I identify as a feminist, to be quite honest. I know there's some people who claim there's a glass ceiling for females -- that they'll never be able to reach CEO or president or five-star general,\" she said.\n\"I think, as long as you work hard, respect those people and serve them to the best of your abilities, there's really no glass ceiling to be broken.\" ", "Week 34: Finding hope in Lamentations": "This week, I realize, that was a pretty bad joke. Because I am not laughing. I am utterly depressed.\nLamentations has made me so sad, which, I know, I should have predicted from the title. But I didn't realize the depth of pain until I read it, and that despair had me reaching out once again for help.\nWhen I told Sister Kathleen at my church that I was doing this project, she sent me home with authoritative texts from Catholic theology. This week, I reached for one of those books: \"The New Jerome Biblical Commentary.\"\nLamentations is short -- it is the mourning over the loss of the Temple and the acceptance of the people's responsibility in the destruction. \nWhile I felt like I was cheating, Sister Kathleen's book helped me gain perspective on Lamentations. It is commonly believed that it was authored by Jeremiah, the Hebrew prophet, which makes much more sense to me as it is a continuation of the Book of Jeremiah.\nThe same components from the Book of Jeremiah were carried over into Lamentations: wormwood, Sodom and Gomorrah, plus mentions of the need for women to eat their young babies to survive in exile.\nI told you it was dark. \nIn \"The New Jerome Biblical Commentary,\" I found this explanation: \"Lamentation is not simply petition; it is rather a spontaneous response to the presence of chaos, brokenness, suffering, and death in life. When we hurt physically, we cry out in pain; when we hurt religiously, we lament.\" \nAnd to lament is defined in the dictionary as a passionate expression of grief and sorrow. Hence, Israelites, your life has been destroyed. It's time to mourn what has been lost. \nBecause Lamentations is so heavily steeped in Jewish history and sorrow, I reached out to Rabbi Esther Lederman again. And yes, I do find it funny that a Catholic named Bernardini has a favorite rabbi.\nIn the Jewish faith, Lamentations is only read in Temple once a year. Rabbi Lederman helped me understand the utter destruction that I found in the book. Imagine a world where you lose everything: your home, your temple, your country. All gone.\nBut while I felt so badly about how sad this all was, Rabbi Lederman pointed me to a little hope.\nThe last sentence of Lamentations is, \"For now you have indeed rejected us, and in full measure turned your wrath against us.\"\nRather than ending that way, Jews reading Lamentations in the Temple each year go back to Lamentations 5:21 and reread it. \"Lead us back to you, O Lord, that we may be restored: give us anew such days as we had of old.\"\nNow that is much more hopeful!\nNext week is Baruch, a minor prophet's book.

I skimmed through my long-forgotten baby book and all of my family's photo albums and posted a Facebook message (typical) about how much I was going to miss my family and home. Despite my excitement about going to college, there was an underlying fear that I'd be lost without my parents, siblings and childhood friends. \nIn reality, that fear probably lasted for a minute or two after my parents left campus. Then my new roommate and I went out to explore, and  independence coupled with the unknown suddenly felt like sweet, sweet freedom.\nNo one else has friends, either.\nMy fear of feeling lost away from home partially stemmed from the realization that I was entering an environment without the security of built-in friends. I had to create my relationships from scratch. \nWhat if I wasn't able to make friends? What if no one liked me? What if everyone else already had friends by the time I got there?\nThese qualms had no basis. What I failed to grasp was that almost every single freshman (except those who lived 15 minutes from campus) was in the same position I was in. They were coming from all over -- Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts -- and they were just as eager to make friends as I was. \nEveryone's doors were always open. \nDON'T bring your entire wardrobe.\nIt has taken me until my junior year to understand this concept. When packing for college the first two years, I gave myself ridiculous reasons to pack every single item in my closet:\n\"I haven't worn this in years, but there is going to be an occasion where this will be the only thing I can wear.\"\n\"I know it's August and it won't be cold at all, but what if a 'snowpocalypse' happens and I'm not prepared? Better pack all my jeans, my weather boots, my sweaters, my jacket, my bigger jacket, my gloves ...\"\nBelieve me, if you have not worn it for a year, you are probably never going to wear it at school. And it will eat up space you don't have in your tiny closet. I repeat: If you don't attend North Pole University, don't bring your parka jacket and gloves in August.\nTop tips from teen who got into all 8 Ivies\nDon't drink? That's OK.\nWhen I was a freshman, I didn't drink. But I was worried other people would try to peer pressure me to drink or shun me and not invite me to parties if I didn't.\nSurprisingly, the reactions were the complete opposite. Not only was there no pressure to drink, but complete strangers would even compliment me when I politely declined alcohol. \n\"You know what? That's actually really cool. Good for you. I respect that.\"\nIt was refreshing to know I would be able to be myself without people judging me (well, not to my face at least). \nYou have every right to say no. If, for whatever reason, someone has a problem with your drinking preferences, it's time to book it. That's not the crowd you want to be around.\nThink it's OK to borrow? Think again.\nSo you've been living at home for the past 18 years. You have lifelong friends you've known since you were in diapers. \nThese people love you unconditionally. When you leave something in their space, they rarely complain. And you share things to the point where you think it's okay to borrow without asking if you plan to give it back in prime condition.\nYou've been warned: It's not OK at college.\nYou and your new friends might jibe well -- and they might seem like your best friends within only a couple of weeks -- but respect their space. These are not people you have known for years, and even if you think you know them inside and out, you don't. \nAlways make sure to ask before you borrow or take anything, even if it's a tissue or a snack. And if they say they don't care, ask anyway. \n5 things that count more than an Ivy League college degree\nThat sandwich you really like? Stop eating it.\nIf you are living in a dorm, chances are you have a mandatory dining plan. At first, this might seem like a blessing: food available all the time, and all you have to do is swipe your school ID card.\nIt's great at first. You'll find grilled chicken and a wrap station that could compete with mom's cooking. So you latch on and decide to eat it for almost every single meal.\nThen you realize a month later that the sight of grilled chicken makes you lose your appetite -- and that you're not really a fan of anything else on the menu. And then you realize this is your life, probably until the end of sophomore year.\nPrepare yourself for the food to get old. Try to expand your palate and change up what you're eating each day if you can. \nBefriend early and often.\nEven if you nail down a tight-knit group of friends, always look to expand your circle. There's no guarantee all friendships will last, and by sophomore year, it's already harder to make friends: The social buzz has died down, and the dorm's open-door policy may no longer be in full effect.\nIf you make an effort early on to be open to as many friends as possible, you'll be happier. And it'll be easier to let some relationships fall through the cracks if they're just not working anymore.\nBest of luck, freshmen!\nColleges that boost your salary the most", "Dog's mystery illness solved by intern": "Ollie, a 10-year-old Sheltie from Portland, Oregon, was moments from being euthanized when a veterinary extern spotted the problem that left the dog fighting for his life.\nThe dog's owners had a tough decision to make when his health started to rapidly deteriorate. Ollie wasn't eating or drinking, he couldn't eliminate on his own and was almost completely paralyzed. \nAfter multiple tests and no sign of a solution, Ollie's owners, Al and Joelle Meteney, decided it was time to end his suffering. \nSee cute dwarf goat knock over playmates\n\"We were at a complete loss,\" Al Meteney said in a \npress release\n. \"What do you do in that situation?

As Golden was comforting the dog, she felt a strange lump in the thick fur behind his ear. \nThe reason for Ollie's sickness had been found: a tick.\nOllie had developed a rare condition called tick paralysis. This condition is caused by a potent toxin that is released through the saliva of a certain species of tick.

And now, more than 100 million people have probably smiled, chuckled and laughed with her. Our chests warmed; our spirits lifted. We may have even felt the receding -- if just for a moment -- of life's many worries. \nWe've been here before. \nBabies laughing at ripped paper.\n \nDouble rainbow\n.\nWhat is happening in these viral moments of joy is as deeply revealing about who we are as a species as our capacity for language, for toolmaking or our opposable thumb. \nHumans have developed a set of virtues that spread good will through social networks, including gratitude, sharing and kindness. All have viral potential. When we express gratitude, share or show kindness, the recipient is moved, often unwittingly, to collaborate and show good will with others. As I explain in my new book, \"The Power Paradox: How We Gain and Lose Influence,\" the expression of these viral virtues weaves through our social fabric. \nViral joy begins in a potent signal of the emotion. Watch Payne's video and you will see a pure expression of joy that my lab at Berkeley has been \nstudying for the past 20 years\n: a suppressed laugh followed by delirious bouts of full-throated laughter, and then contractions of the orbicularis oculi, the muscle surrounding the eye, that signals joy. And, there is the slapping of the thigh, body and heading-shaking, and a near-breathlessness brought about by deep patterns of exhalation that systematically accompany laughter. \nIn one recent study, when Daniel Cordaro presented such \nsounds of laughter to people in 11 cultures\n, including people in remote Bhutan, these people knew that it was a sign of mirth and levity about 90% of the time. Joyous laughter is a universal human experience. \nIt's also good for us. We know from scientific studies that \nthis kind of laughter calms cardiovascular stress\n, producing a state of calm after the convulsive movements accompanying the laugh. Notice Payne's blissed-out look near the end of her video. \nWhen a joy signal is perceived by others -- in this case, millions of others -- something remarkable happens. It triggers contagious, and often unconscious, joy in observers. Viral virtues such as joy spread to others through the empathy network in our frontal lobes, activated by perceptions of others' emotional expressions. \nResearch, particularly by Naomi Eisenberger at the University of California, Los Angeles, has shown that for most \npeople who witness someone in physical pain\n, their own pain network in the brain (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) is activated. Observers of Payne's joy very likely experienced some activation in their joy-related circuits in the brain (dopamine-rich nucleus accumbens and ventral striatum) and a sense of calm, perspective and willingness to engage with others: all qualities of joy. \nObservers feeling contagious joy triggered by Payne's laughter now carry that emotion with them. Feeling more joyous, they themselves will show the signs of joy and be \ndisposed to share\n, cooperate and connect with others to broaden and build their social networks. Through these viral processes, suggest studies by James Fowler, \nour joy spreads virally \nto friends and acquaintances in our social networks, lifting their spirits later in time. \nThe same is true of the other viral virtues. For example, when \nwe share a resource with someone\n, that person will share it with those who share and so on. When we express gratitude to someone, that individual, studies find, is more likely to act in appreciative and kind ways with others. The transmission of viral joy, gratitude, sharing and kindness collectively strengthen our social networks.\nIn her own way, Payne had a powerful impact on the well-being and good will of tens of millions of people. I myself feel compelled to find one of those Chewbacca masks, to see if I too might find the uplifting joy of laughter and spread that good will to others.  ", "Free-roam childhoods fading away": "\"I'm right back where I started,\" she said, among the same fields of beans and corn, among the same people.\nExcept one, in particular. \nNow there's Tharin, her son. He was born overseas, and he was 4 when they moved to Illinois. He's 8 now, and he has bruised knees, dirty nails and an endless well of energy. His parents wanted him to be outside in a safe, wide-open place where he has freedom to roam, and that meant coming home.\nHabing, a photographer, began to shoot images of Tharin as he first explored this land that was so familiar to her. Only once she looked more closely did she realize she had more than family snapshots. It was black-and-white memories of childhoods past.\n\"He was getting to do the things that I got to do when I grew up,\" Habing said.\nOf course, she and her son are different. She was a quiet and content girl, she said. She spent hours playing with her siblings.\nTharin is an only child, and he is nonstop motion. He will get up the morning and head outside to check on the plants or hunt the bugs around the farm. Cats love him, and new ones seem to emerge all the time, seeking affection from him. \nHe's obsessed with his four-wheeler and will venture all over the farm, exploring new territory and getting stuck in mud puddles.\n\"His grandpa has one, his uncle has one, he thinks he needs a bigger and better one,\" Habing said. \"He will literally ride that four-wheeler all day long, till he runs out of gas.\"\nHabing shoots in black and white just because it's how she feels most comfortable. Still, to capture an image is a pleasant coincidence. There's no hovering over Tharin.\n\"You still can't plan it,\" Habing said. \"I just let him do his own thing.\"\nShe gets a lot of email from older people, she said -- people who happen upon her photos and see a childhood that looks like their own, one that seems almost impossible for a kid to have now.\n\"You can't just let your kid run anymore. You get arrested, basically,\" she said. \"I want him outside and to learn things on (his) own.\"\nNot all the photos inspire warm nostalgia. Habing often captures Tharin with toy guns, and she's noticed that the images raise eyebrows. To Tharin, anything can be a weapon, whether is a water gun, a stick or a piece of cardboard.\nThey are not \"gun people,\" she said, but there are actual guns around the farm. More likely, he learned it from TV or video games, she said -- he certainly plays more of those than she did. \nOr maybe it's just Tharin. Or just age 8. Or just boyhood.\nChildren, Habing believes, need to connect with nature, make mistakes and get themselves out of jams. \n\"I hope people will look at them,\" she said of her photos, \"and remember that kids need to be outside.\"", "The case for gender-neutral marketing": "Despite some criticism, the big box retailer has been quick to act on its pledge. \nStores across the country have removed references to \"boys\" and \"girls\" in toy, home and entertainment aisles and traded in pink and blue shelves for a neutral, wood-grain look. Instead, toys are sorted by categories -- dolls, action figures, building sets, etc. -- while books and movies are sorted by genre and bedding is just... bedding. (For now, Target's website is a different matter.)\nSome derided Target for caving to overly sensitive, politically correct factions of the American public. Let girls be girls and boys be boys, they argued, and lamented that public bathrooms might be next. \nThose on the other side of the debate, who welcomed the shift as a positive step toward gender equality, have a different rallying cry: \nLet toys be toys already\n.\nLike it or not, it's happening, and -- if decades of research are to be believed -- that's probably a good thing. Here's what science has to say about making the toy aisle gender-neutral.\nBoys and girls are not as different as we say they are\nWe've heard it all before: Girls are natural caregivers who are more nurturing than boys and that makes them more attracted to dolls. Boys are more likely than girls to prefer games, puzzles and learning toys because they are better at math and science. \nThose tropes may not reflect biology as much as social expectations. \nThere's no denying men and women are biologically different. When it comes to psychological traits and abilities, time and again, the evidence has suggested men and women, as well as boys and girls, are more alike than they are different.\nVarious studies in the past decades have assessed the impact of gender on traits that define our personalities: verbal and nonverbal communication, aggression, leadership, self-esteem, moral reasoning and motor behaviors. The most recent meta-analysis of those findings, published in 2005 in American Psychologist, found that 78% of the magnitude of gender differences were in the small or close-to-zero range. \nA few common perceptions held, according to psychologist Janet Shibley Hyde of the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Compared with women, men could throw farther, were more physically aggressive, masturbated more and held more positive attitudes about sex in uncommitted relationships. \nThe studies also found these characteristics fluctuate with age, depending on environmental influences, challenging perceptions that gender differences are large and stable, Hyde wrote.\nWhat does any of this have to do with toys? Nothing, really, which is basically the point. Parents and environment are more likely to influence which toy a child picks up, not gender.\nIt goes beyond play time to expectations for how children think, behave, even their aspirations.\n\"When we tell children dolls are for girls and trucks are for boys, we're telling them not only are you a boy or a girl, but that being a boy or a girl is going to determine how you think and act and the skills you will develop,\" said University of Kentucky psychology professor Christia Spears Brown, author of \"Parenting Beyond Pink and Blue: How to Raise Kids Free of Gender.\"\nDifferent toys benefit children in different ways\nIt's a perception that makes psychologists and educators cringe: They're just toys; they don't influence my children.\nNot so, according to decades of peer-reviewed scientific research of how toy play impacts childhood development. Dolls bring out nurturing skills and empathy; building blocks develop spatial skills; reading maps and hitting targets with balls increases cognitive skills.\nIt benefits children to experience all the things.\n\"Every time children play with toys, they're getting something out of it. They're learning something about the world,\" said developmental psychologist Erica Weisgram of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.\n\"We need to be asking what are they learning; and, if they're playing with different toys, is it OK to learn different things?\"\nColor and labels can matter, too. Weisgram co-authored a study published in 2014 that explored how labeling toys for girls and boys and using gender-typed colors impacts children's toy preferences.\n\"Children can develop various skills more fully with a variety of toys and activities that can help them practice and hone these skills,\" Weisgram said\n. \n\"Breaking down gender stereotypes surrounding these toys and activities can help them to engage in them and more fully reach their potential.\"\nResearchers showed children toys in different colors -- monster trucks and fairy wands in pink or blue, among others -- and asked them who the toys were intended for and if they would play with them.\nThe responses indicated boys were uninterested in feminine toys regardless of color. Girls were interested in masculine toys when they were pink and purple, but they were significantly less interested in masculine toys with colors perceived to be masculine. \n\"When children see and hear gender labels from parents, peers, siblings, grandparents, and even the toy aisles themselves, these messages will sway a child's interest away from some toys and toward others,\" Weisgram said. \n\"We feel children should be free to follow their interests, without gender labels and stereotypes swaying them.\" \nColor-coding toys can backfire down the road\nIf selling girls pink monster trucks makes girls more likely to play with them, that's a good thing, right? Maybe so, but the long-term implications for childhood development may not be worth it. \nIt's a conundrum epitomized by LEGO Friends, the purple-packaged building sets launched in 2012 to appeal to girls uninterested in classic LEGO sets, according to the toy company.\nLEGO \nsaid it developed the line\n based on market research of what girls wanted in a construction toy. The feedback -- \"realistic themes in community and friendship\" -- led to Heartlake City, a LEGO land featuring curvy \"LadyFigs\" with names and backstories about getting dolled up in salons, lounging at the pool and shopping with friends.\nDespite flak from parents, educators, psychologists and media critics, LEGO Friends' popularity is not really surprising. There's overwhelming evidence that shows children, if given the choice, go for toys based on gender associations. Those choices then affect their development. \nBut what message does that send, and should we encourage it? \n\"Ultimately it tells kids you're so different based on your gender that you can't even play with the same toy,\" said Brown, author of \"Parenting Beyond Pink and Blue.\"\n\"If that's what you tell them, are you going to be surprised when they grow up and think there are some jobs only girls can do and some only boys can do? If you're so different biologically at 8 years old that you can't play with the same toy, why would you expect equality in adulthood?\"\nEven if girls are drawn to masculine toys in feminine colors, they might still think of them as \"different\" than the boys' version -- and that's the problem.\nToys with strong feminized themes  -- chemistry sets to invent makeup, building sets to design a shopping mall -- leave girls with a narrow set of experiences and exclude girls that aren't interested in makeup or shopping, Washington and Lee psychology professor Megan Fulcher said \nLike sports team logos and colors, these toys represent a social group to which we belong. Children begin to identify with a color and actively reject others. \n\"It sends a worrisome message to girls that they are welcome to do math, engineering, science or even superheroes as long as they do it differently than boys,\" Fulcher said.\nHyperfeminized toys may even backfire by overemphasizing the importance of gender associations, said psychologist Emily F. Coyle, who examined the impact of feminized characters in a recent study described in \"Developmental Interventions to Address the STEM Gender Gap.\"\n\"Simply making traditionally masculine toys pink might attract girls to the toy on one level, but it doesn't guarantee that girls won't apply their experience with traditionally feminine modes of play when they use the toy,\" she said. \n\"Making toys appealing on the basis of femininity might be really attractive to girls with feminine interests, but it doesn't guarantee that girls will learn the messages we might be trying to package with that.\"  \nToy makers have a role to play, too\nIn sum, parents have tremendous influence on the toy preferences of their children, maybe even more than the toy store. But parents only recently began to actively cross the gender line when it comes to purchasing toys for their children, for all the reasons mentioned above.\nFor the most part, numerous surveys and studies over the years have found adults tend to encourage gender-typed play among children by the kinds of toys they purchase. It's a cycle: Gender stereotypes are fostered in childhood and take shape in adulthood, to be passed on to children. \nToy makers take advantage of this cycle by packaging toys in gender-specific colors and labels, reinforcing stereotypes. \nBut it doesn't have to be this way, says Bjorn Jeffery, co-founder of Toca Boca, which makes digital toys for children 3 to 7. \nToca Hair Salon and Toca Hair Salon 2, which feature male and female characters of different races, are the company's top-selling apps in terms of downloads and revenue, outselling Disney's Princess Salon.\nBjorn says conventional wisdom that boys and girls prefer certain toys in a specific color based on gender is a \"self-fulfilling prophecy and a bit of a cop-out,\" especially when you take history into account. \nIn her best-selling book, \"\nCinderella Ate My Daughter\n,\" Peggy Orenstein writes that toy marketing companies have increased the use of gender-typed colors in the packaging of toys in recent decades to boost profits. \nPrior to World War II\n, the rule was pink for boys and blue for girls.\nGender neutral is part of Toca Boca's brand strategy, says Bjorn. It means using a broad color palette and diverse characters that appeal to boys and girls within the same play environment, be it in a beauty salon or at a tea party.\nIt's a good business model, financially and ethically, he said. By creating products that appeal to both sexes, Toca Boca effectively doubles its market without steering children in one direction or another.\n\"I'd rather let children have the freedom to play with whatever they want to play with,\" he said. \"It gives them the right to choose.\"\nHe acknowledges that Toca Boca has a distinct advantage in not having to rely on traditional retailers or brick and mortar stores to sell its products. That's the beauty of disruptive business models, he said: \"You can challenge status quo without having to go head on.\"\nIf Target can do it, he's hopeful others will follow.", "Why women should make the first move in online dating": "A recent OkCupid study \nfound men are more likely to send the first message on the dating website than women.

Men, on the other hand, send a median of nine to 15 first messages, depending on their age.\nOkCupid Chief Product Officer Jimena Almendares said the company was surprised by the research project's results.\n\"There was clearly a unique opportunity specifically for women on OkCupid when it came to messaging first,\" she said.\nStacy Kaiser, \"Live Happy\" editor-at-large and licensed psychotherapist,  said many women still hold onto old-fashioned dating traditions like relying on men to make the first move.\n\"Fear and rejection are feelings that go along with that,\" Kaiser said.\nThese findings contrast with\n the idea that young women are part of a hookup culture \nthat has reached its apex with the advent of dating apps like Tinder. Granted, swiping right as a sign of approval to (hopefully) get a match doesn't take much heavy lifting. Sending the first message, on the other hand, seems to be perceived as men's work. \nA quick perusal of Twitter shows that while some women advocate for making the first move, others shy away from it.\n\"Why do women have to make the first move? To a certain extent that's not the woman's job -- in terms of chivalry (which this generation lacks)\" wrote one woman.\n\"Ladies if you want a certain man go get them... Who cares if women aren't suppose to make the first move, go get what you want,\" another countered.\nWhen online dating, a woman can increase her chance of going on a date with a man who is attractive to her by sending the first message, according to the dating site's findings. \nAlmendares said OkCupid analyzed the attractiveness of all the men who women had a conversation with after they sent the first message, and the median attractiveness of those men was 6.6 percentile points above the attractiveness of the women sending the message. The site measured attractiveness as having nice looks, engaging photos and an intriguing profile.\n\"So even if women select the best from their inbox, it's likely they are settling and going on a date [with] someone less attractive,\" Almendares said. \"More importantly, because very few women message first, those that do stand out.\"\nThe study found that the odds would be in favor of the brave woman who messages a guy first, because 30% of those messages turn into a conversation. Women are 2.5 times more likely to get a response than men if they initiate contact.\nBack to Twitter, where some guys complain about how much they wish women would take charge and make the first move.\n\"Sometimes women should make the first move. It adds a little excitement,\" wrote one user.\n\"Live Happy's\" Kaiser advises women to be casual when initiating a relationship and to not make \"a big buildup in your head or real life.\"\n\"For example, you don't need to call it 'a date' if he just wants to hang out or grab something quick. Also, it is always good to rope in a friend to help, or getting a group of people to go out, and then you can make sure you sit next to him, find time to flirt, et cetera,\" Kaiser says.\nAlmendares said social norms are changing and women would gain more by seizing the moment.\n\"Ten years ago, online dating wasn't the norm, but today, it's the new normal. However, the one norm that has yet to change is who makes the first move. This is why women who shift this dynamic have such a big advantage.\"", "Parent Acts: How to stop a kid's meltdown": "If you have kids and you've experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what I mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions -- embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. Even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn't seem to work when your child is at wit's end and unable to calm down.\nWe recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new CNN Digital video series called \n\"Parent Acts.\"\n Since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.\nPauline Hilborn, a mom of two in New York City, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is \"7-years-old but sounds more like 13.\"\nCase in point: Hilborn's daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer Ariana Grande, but felt like her mom didn't do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.\n\"She came out crying and said, 'Ariana Grande's ponytail is here not here,'\" said Hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.\n\"I was at a loss for words,\" she said. \"I had no idea what to say but my husband said, 'Well, she's right you know,' which didn't help the situation.\"\nDebi, another mother of two in Manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums. When I asked her son what a meltdown is, he told me it's when you cry a lot. When I asked him to imitate one, he said he keeps screaming until his mom lets him have whatever it is that he wants at that moment.\n\"I completely freeze in those situations,\" she said. \"I lose all rational sense of now what do I do  ... I don't know how to do it without bribing him, so I end up taking away things.\"\nHelp is on the way \nTricia Ferrara\n is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. She's also author of \n\"Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,\"\n a guide book for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children.\nFerrara listened to our parent volunteers imitate exactly what their children do and say during a meltdown, and then offered her advice:\nNo. 1 -- Try to prevent it\nYes, you can actually prevent a meltdown, said Ferrara, a mom of two teens. Kids get tired and hungry, and then they can't tell you what's going on. \"You want to try and maybe not bring a child to places that trigger them,\" and avoid outings at the end of the day when it's still difficult for them to coordinate their emotions with their body, she said. (I wish I had this in mind that time I decided to take my kids, then 2 and 4, grocery shopping right before dinner time. Not a smart move.)\nNo. 2 -- Disregard what other people think\nWhile it may be hard to do, we need to forget about the other people watching us during those cringe-worthy moments when our kids are yelling at the top of their lungs and people are definitely noticing. \"I always say to parents ... you've got to stop, drop and do what you have to do,\" she said. \"Escalating back to the child is not helping anything, because that's more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear.\" Think of yourself as a \"tuning fork,\" said Ferrara. \"The calmer and clearer you can be, the better things will go.\"\nNo. 3 -- Create a small upside for them \nAdults sometimes have to look for creative ways to maintain authority, and eliciting small concessions from your child can go a long way, said Ferrara. \"Create one bit of upside even if it's, 'You take one breath and we count to three together [then] we can get you want you want, and then we'll go home,' she explained. \"What that does is it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation.\" \nNo. 4 -- Don't leave home without a strategy \nThe \"biggest mistake\" parents make is they go into situations \"without a strategy,\" said Ferrara. \"Do you go to the hair dresser without a plan? A business meeting? Go buy a car? No, but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan,\" she said.  \nRemember Debi, the mom who said her son sometimes has meltdowns when he can't get what he wants? Ferrara said before heading out or going anywhere, she could tell her son that how he behaves is going to determine whether he could do something else, such as play with his birthday presents that evening. \n\"And so when he starts to behave in a way that is not acceptable to you, instead of getting into the verbal joust with him, you can say, 'Do you want to play with your birthday presents?' You can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way that he understands,\" said Ferrara to Debi. \"If you rock back a bit and anticipate a little more and be a little more strategic, you might get better results from him,\" she said. \"And after consistency, he's going to know, 'Oh it's a new day.'\"\nNo. 5 -- Help children convey how they feel\nWhen the body is flailing, that often means the language is not working, said Ferrara. For example, in the case of Hilborn, the mom who's daughter melted down after the ponytail disaster, Ferrara said she could have said to her daughter, \"Honey, if you need help, say it. Say 'Mom, I need help changing the ponytail.' That language helps her organize herself.\" \n\"You want your child to have an expectation of things, but she can't beat up on other people to get there, and certainly you can't stand in for that,\" Ferrara said to Hilborn. \"So what you want to do is teach her to say, 'I need help. I want this changed,' and then you can move in a more functional way.\"\nOh, and another piece of advice? Teach Dad how to do the Ariana Grande ponytail! \nHave any good meltdown stories? We all do!

", "How these viral videos inspired viral joy": "It is the most simple thing ever, yet it's snowballed into Facebook Live's most-watched video ever . \nDespite how ridiculous it seems, Candance Payne's legendary debut is not an indictment of our culture of social virality. Rather, it's a profoundly simple reminder of what, deep in our hearts, we already know: joy is contagious. Laughter is good for us. A smile on someone else's face is as good as one on our own. \nThese organic moments of unfettered mirth, surprise, or happiness are much more available to us now that every phone has a camera and millions of  strangers' lives are just a video click and tap away. \nThe early days of viral joy \nThink back to the first time you saw, secondhand, a moment of true joy. Not shock or amusement, or something funny that made you laugh -- Someone else's real happiness. \nFor a lot of YouTube natives, one of those first moments was Susan Boyle. The unassuming lady in pantyhose and a church dress captivated \"Britain's Got Talent\" in 2009 with her powerful voice. \nThe video is an onion of happiness. There's the judges and the audience; amazed, pleased, and moved. Then there's Boyle, whose own joy unfolds as, through cheers and gasps, she's realizes she's nailed it. \nThe original video of her debut has 191 million views on YouTube, and Boyle obviously became a household name. \nMilitary homecoming videos never get old \nIf you want to get stuck in a rabbit hole of laughter and tears, look no further than the scores of military homecoming videos that rack up thousands upon thousands of views. There's a reason they are irresistible: Their innate happiness transcends time, distance, and familiarity. \nIt's a phenomenon backed by science. Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley who served as a scientific consultant on Pixar's film \"Inside Out,\" says emotions are super easy to access even if they're not your own. \n\"Viral virtues such as joy spread to others through the empathy network in our frontal lobes, activated by perceptions of others' emotional expressions,\" \nhe wrote for CNN\n. \nThis girl's sweet reaction to her father's surprise is one of the most-watched military homecoming videos on YouTube. \nAdd in a pet, and the joy potential skyrockets -- such as this dog freaking out about his owner's return from overseas. \nDuuude! It's the simple things \nIt's a double rainbow all the way! If you've been on the Internet at all in the last six years, you may have read that line in the voice of \nPaul \"Bear\" Vasquez\n, the star of the iconic \"double rainbow\" video.\nSure, double rainbows are cool,. But much like the Chewbacca mask video, the locus of joy here isn't nearly as compelling as the joy itself. Vasquez doesn't just appreciate the rainbow, he basically weeps at the sight of it. \nLaughing babies are a universal language\nSmiling and laughter -- two obvious indicators of joy -- are nearly impossible to misconstrue. \n\"Joyous laughter is a universal human experience,\" Keltner \nwrote for CNN\n. \nKeltner says, in one recent study, even people in remote areas of the world knew that the sound of laughter was \"a sign of mirth and levity.\"\nThat explains why babies, the most malleable and imitative of humans, are so gosh darned good at laughing. Though that doesn't mean what they laugh about is easy to explainh: Take this video of a baby losing his stuffing over his dad ripping a piece of paper. Funny to an adult? Not really. But the baby belly laughs definitely are. \nAnd as if you needed any more proof, observe this legendary laughter feedback loop -- four quadruplets giggling on their mother, each feeding off the others' good humor. They even sound alike!\nEveryone loves surprises\nMuch like homecoming videos, there's something to be said about the event horizon of joy, of witnessing the exact moment someone's life is changed for the better. A surprise gift or pregnancy announcement will do. \nSure, you respect the planning that goes into these videos, but it's really all about the look on the recipient's face. \nThis dad's happiness made him a viral sensation in 2012. Nothing like family, a surprise, a passion, and a good old manly cry to earn 10 million views. \nOr these parents, who just found out they were grandparents-to-be and couldn't care less about the camera in their face. That's some prime-cut, 100% authentic joy right there. \nJust really darn cute \nAs we said before, add animals, and any video's joy potential goes off the charts. \nIt's interesting, though -- there's a specific feeling to be had when watching other people interact with their animals as opposed to just animals alone. \nSure, a puppy rolling around on the floor is adorable, but watching, say, this boy helping his little pup discover the joys of howling speaks even more to our humanity. \nOr, you could go deeper and combine laughing babies AND puppies. 16 million views on this one: \nIs there such a thing as too much joy? You can ponder that if you ever wipe that goofy grin off your face. ", "'I am you': American Muslims on faith -- and fear": "The rapper shaping young minds\nAlia Sharrief has many identities. She's black, she's Muslim, she's a hijab-wearing hip-hop artist.\nIf you ask Sharrief about her identity, she'll tell you instantly that she loves being black and Muslim. There's even a popular hashtag called #BeingBlackandMuslim that she uses regularly on social media to show her pride.\nBut being black and Muslim isn't the same as being just Muslim, she says.\n\"I deal with the struggles of Islamophobia and the prejudices against black people,\" she says. Stories about African-Americans like\n Eric Garner \nand \nMichael Brown\n dying in police altercations have hardened the Oakland, California, resident.\nA majority of Muslims in the United States are immigrants or children of immigrants. Among Muslims who were born in the U.S. about \n40% describe themselves as African-American\n, according to a 2011 report by the Pew Research Center. Many of these African-American Muslims converted to \nIslam\n.\nThat's the case for Sharrief's parents. Her mother and father grew up as Southern Baptists in Mississippi and Georgia, respectively, before converting to Islam in their teenage years after the civil rights movement.\nSharrief has found ways to combine her faith with her African-American heritage.\nThe 26-year-old elementary school teacher is also an up-and-coming rapper. She has opened for hip-hop artists like Grammy-winner Kendrick Lamar in the past. But Sharrief challenges the stereotypes of mainstream hip-hop artists by sporting a headscarf and spitting out lyrics about Islam and the Prophet Mohammed when she's performing.\nHer music often surprises audiences. They've never seen a hijab-wearing Muslim woman rap before. \"I hear, 'Wow, I haven't heard anything like this,'\" she says. The audience's excitement makes her want to keep talking about Islam.\nSharrief teaches second and third-graders at a Muslim charter school in the San Francisco Bay Area. Sometimes, she shares her music with her students. They love it and always request to hear more.\nShe's trying to reclaim the American Muslim narrative through her work, she says. She wants to highlight all the good things Muslims are doing around the world, like when Muslims raised about \n$50,000 to rebuild burned African-American churches \nin the United States back in June 2015.\nBut it feels like she's starting over whenever there's a terrorist attack in the name of Islam, she says.\nAfter Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, \nshot and killed 14 people during a holiday party\n in December in San Bernardino, California, about a six-hour drive from Oakland, Sharrief felt nervous walking around the Bay Area. She noticed people looking at her hijab, which made her uncomfortable.\n\"When (San Bernardino) happened, I heard things like, 'all you Muslims are dangerous,'\" she says. \"I have never had a thought like that. I have never wanted to hurt someone.\"\nHer best weapon against the violence is her music, she says. \"There are so many stereotypes about Muslims, and I want to say: 'Hey, I come in peace. We don't believe in this stuff.'\"\nThe medical student at the Christian school\nThe nerves were already kicking in.\nMadiha Khan had been waiting more than two hours for the most important interview of her life.\nSo many things were running through her head: \"Will I like it here? Will they want me here? Will they care that I'm different?\"\nThis was Khan's first interview at the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Liberty University. She chose her words thoughtfully. She wanted to be a doctor. She wanted to help people.\nThen one of the faculty members asked a question that gave her pause: \"How do you think you will fit in here?\"\nLiberty University is a staunchly conservative school in Lynchburg, Virginia. Saying that it has deep Christian roots is an understatement. Southern Baptist pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell founded the university decades ago, and it has become a pit stop for many conservative politicians. Republican candidate \nTed Cruz announced he was running for president\n on campus in March 2015, and \nDonald Trump was endorsed by Jerry Falwell Jr.\n, son of the late televangelist, in January.\nWith her fair skin and hazel eyes, Khan blends in well on campus. But she's a Muslim with Pakistani origins. Liberty sounds like the last place a Muslim student would want to be at, but Khan liked the university's religious identity, she says. The 23-year-old was drawn to Liberty's beliefs.\n\"I'm not a Christian, but I share the same values as this school,\" she remembers saying during the interview.\nThere's no drinking on campus, and students are expected to dress modestly. Those were some of the little things that spoke to Khan, who grew up in a relatively non-practicing Muslim household in the New York City borough of Queens.\nIt's been about six months since Khan started school, and she's one of six Muslims who she knows of on the graduate school campus, which can be challenging when it comes to practicing her faith at school.\nShe'll get stares as she prays in a corner of the graduate school's library between classes. Usually, her peers are curious. Her Christian classmates strike up conversations with her about Islam, and most of the time, they find similarities between the two faiths, rather than differences.\n\"Meeting me and my roommate, who is also Muslim, I think it's changing my peers' worldviews,\" she says.\nAlthough she feels like she has dispelled a few misconceptions about American Muslims, every terrorist attack by an extremist feels like another step back.\n\"One of the first things I thought when I heard about the San Bernardino shootings was, 'please don't let them be Muslim,'\" she says. \"It's sad to say that out loud, but the atmosphere keeps getting worse, and I feel helpless.\"\nShortly after the San Bernardino shooting in December, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students during a ceremony that \nthey should arm themselves\n. \n\"I always thought that if more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walk in and kill,\" Falwell said during the event. Those words spurred energetic applause from thousands of college students at the weekly convocation.\nIn a phone interview with CNN after the convocation, Falwell said he wasn't talking about all Muslims, just those who perpetrate attacks.\nIbrahim Hooper, the director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told CNN in December that Falwell's comments were discriminatory toward American Muslims. \"It's part of an overall toxic anti-Muslim atmosphere that we're seeing, particularly in the past few weeks with Paris and San Bernardino,\" Hooper said. \"Anti-Muslim bigotry was still on the fringes after 9/11. But it's moving toward the mainstream thanks to Donald Trump, Ben Carson and these types of comments.\"\nKhan, a graduate student at the medical school, wasn't at the convocation when Falwell made those comments. But it took her only minutes to find out from her friends and family.\n\"My parents called that night and told me to not walk alone on campus at night,\" she says.\n\"Honestly, I was mad,\" she says. She was scared and upset, but she wasn't surprised. \"I'm not naive. I knew coming here that it would sort of be like this; that I would have to explain who I am and what I stand for, and that I would be seen as different,\" she says.\nAs someone who is part of a relatively new osteopathic medicine program at the university, Khan had hopes that she could set a positive example for American Muslims. \"I had this idea that maybe I can change the culture here,\" she says.\nEven though Falwell's comments scared her, they aren't stopping her from pursuing her degree or being an advocate for Muslims on campus. \"If I can educate a Christian kid about what it's like to be a Muslim person, that means a lot to me,\" she says.\nAnd in many ways, Liberty University has made Khan stronger too. Since starting the osteopathic medicine program, being around her Christian classmates has given her a sense of appreciation for who she is, Khan says.\n\"When I'm around people who are unapologetic about their faith, I think that that is how I want to be,\" she says. \"I think it has made me a better Muslim, actually.\"\n'The only Muslim family in town'\nThe grassy plains of Worland, Wyoming, seem to stretch forever. The mountains, the valley, the world here look endless.\nBut when you're one of the few Muslim families in a town of 5,500, Worland can feel like a pretty small place. The son of Pakistani immigrants, Hamid Khan grew up in this northwestern Wyoming city along the Bighorn River during the 1980s.\nThere wasn't a mosque in town back then. Holidays like Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr were observed in the privacy of their home. And as a teenager, he was one of the few Muslims his friends met in school.\nAlthough Muslim families were rare in Worland at the time, most residents were curious about the Khan family. What did they eat? What were their traditions? What did they believe in?\nBut Khan, now 39, says that curiosity is being replaced by fear. In December, his cousin died of cancer. When Khan and his family held an Islamic funeral in Colorado for his cousin, gunshots were fired from a truck driving by at the memorial service.\n\"They said 'F*** you, rag heads' and drove off. It was terrifying,\" he says.\nAs an adjunct professor at the University of South Carolina, Khan teaches about Islam and Islamic law. He says that every presidential election, anti-Muslim rhetoric seems to bubble to the surface.\nThere's research backing up his observation. Dalia Mogahed, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on Muslim issues, says studies suggest \nanti-Islamic sentiment becomes more prominent\n during presidential election years, as some politicians, influencers and media personalities try to take a harsher stance on Muslims to show their hawkish side.\n\"It's hurtful to think that those who are seeking the highest offices in the land are ignoring the basic tenets of the Constitution and suddenly concluding that Muslims have a predisposition for violence,\" Khan says. \"It feels like we're a punching bag.\"\nBeing a Muslim doesn't make a person any less American, Khan adds.\nThat's what he wants his four kids, all under the age of 12, to remember. A few months ago, his new teaching job brought him and his family to an even smaller town than the one he grew up in. Blythewood, deep inside the historically red state of South Carolina, has about 2,000 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. Census.\nWhen they first arrived, Khan immediately wondered whether his kids would stick out. \"Teachers on day one were struggling with their names,\" he says.\nBut even in this small town deep in the Bible Belt, there have been a lot of positives for the family, Khan says. Recently, administrators at his children's school asked him to come in and speak about Islam after learning about his career and seeing him speak about the topic on local television.\n\"If that is the silver lining and I get a little more traction in South Carolina, so be it.\" Khan says.\nAmerica is his family's home, and they aren't going anywhere.\n\"I am you. Your neighbor, your teacher, your friend and a fellow American.\"\nThe Brooklyn dad and the homemade clock\nSyed Meer was in junior high when the \nIran hostage crisis unfolded\n.\nIn November 1979, Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage and holding 52 of them for 444 days. The crisis is often described as the United States' first brush with \npolitical Islam\n.\nIt was also when the kids at his Boston school started calling Meer \"Ayatollah.\"\nIt feels like the attitudes toward Muslims have only gotten more hostile since the '70s, the 49-year-old says.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that 2015, studded by violent attacks by extremists in the name of Islam at home and abroad, was one of the most \nanti-Muslim periods in U.S history\n, according to a survey by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nSome politicians have proposed policies singling out Muslims in response to attacks by terror groups like ISIS\u200b that have spread beyond the borders of Iraq and Syria. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has proposed temporarily banning Muslims immigrants from entering the country and increasing surveillance of mosques in the United States.\nThis sort of rhetoric is creating an unwelcoming atmosphere, says Meer, a motion graphic designer of Indian descent.\n\"It feels like the West versus Islam,\" he says. Meer, who has called America home for decades, is scared; not for himself, but for his kids. He doesn't want Islam to be associated with a violent narrative because of how others portray the religion.\n\"My 14-year-old son was joking with my wife and said every student should have a Muslim lab partner, because if something blows up, they have someone to blame,\" he says. \"That was hard to hear.\" \nMeer isn't ashamed of being Muslim, and he doesn't want his kids to be either.\nAfter Texas teenager \nAhmed Mohamed\n was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school, Meer instantly thought about the impact on his own kids. \nHis kids play games like Minecraft and enjoy tinkering with projects. One of his sons is passionate about the maker movement, a do-it-yourself movement for inventors, designers and hobbyists, and another wants to build a jet pack someday.\nMeer fully expects that his kids will one day build their own version of a homemade clock or a different project, and he can't help but think about how others will react. \n\"I don't want them to be afraid,\" he says.\nThe unapologetic Texas mama\nMehnaz Mahmood wasn't like the other girls at her elementary school in the suburbs of Houston.\nShe came to class dressed in frumpy homemade clothes sewn by her Bangladeshi mother. Her brown skin made her stand out against her mostly white classmates, and she sometimes felt a little clueless about American traditions.\n\"I was sort of a FOB,\" she says. That's short for \"fresh off the boat,\" a phrase used to joke about immigrants.\nMost kids assumed Mahmood was Mexican, until they heard her name. It has been more than two decades, but the 33-year-old homemaker in McKinney, Texas, still remembers the first time she felt like an outsider because of her faith. She was in the third grade, introducing herself to one of her classmates, Mahmood recalls.\n\"I told her my name, and I remember this girl made a face and asked me, 'What kind of name is that?'\" she says.\n\"I said it was a Muslim name. Then she said, 'Muslim? Oh, you guys are terrorists,'\" Mahmood says.\nThose words were like a slap in the face.\nShe encountered similar feelings after the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks\n. Her neighbors were skeptical of her and she remembers the stares she got from strangers.\nAbout half of Muslim Americans say it has become \ndifficult to practice their faith since the 2001 attacks\n, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey. Mahmood thinks that sentiment still holds true in 2016. After seeing so many news stories about the terror and destruction caused by groups like \nISIS\n and\n Boko Haram\n, Mahmood is frightened for her kids, her family and her country, too.\n\"That isn't Islam. They are terrorists,\" she says.\nIt's a lesson she's trying to teach her kids. Mahmood is the mother of a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son. She doesn't want them to be ashamed of their faith. For her daughter Noreen's ninth birthday, she gave her a children's book about women in Islam. It's adorned with a golden cover and intricate drawings of paisleys.\nAt night, before bedtime, they read stories about strong women in Islam, like Khadijah, the Prophet Mohammed's first wife. Islamic scholars say she was an older widow and a businesswoman before she remarried to Mohammed. \nMahmood wants her kids to know their religion is rooted in helping people, not hurting them.\n\"I want them to be seen as strong, good human beings,\" she says. \"If faith helps them, then I hope that they are ambassadors for our faith.\"", "'Streetwise' revisited: Teen prostitute finds motherhood, stability": "Thousands? Tens of thousands?\nHow many faces did she find in obscurity -- and immortalize in celluloid?\nFrom India to Iceland. Africa and Asia. Across the Middle East and Europe. In mental institutions and leprosy wards. Circuses. Bordellos. Street corners everywhere. Hers was \na legend\n earned out in the world, over 50 years, without abandon.  \nShe sought the \"unfamous\" and photographed them with empathy and technical mastery. \nBut none like Erin \"Tiny\" Blackwell, the 13-year-old prostitute she found among Seattle's vagrant youth while on assignment for Life magazine in 1983. \n\"Mary Ellen saw this little girl dressed like a woman get out of a car in a parking lot alongside the Monastery nightclub. Mary Ellen instantly knew she would be the star of the photographs. Because Mary Ellen was always looking for \nthat\n. There \nit\n was,\" said Martin Bell, Mark's widower and longtime collaborator. \n\"It\" is a presence on camera. To be unafraid to lay bare one's individuality and essence -- vulnerabilities and strengths alike. \nMark's assignment evolved into a 30-year collaboration between her and her new husband. \nBell directed the Academy Award-nominated documentary \"Streetwise,\" which chronicles three months in the life of Tiny and the rambunctious community of runaway teens in a pre-Starbucks, pre-Amazon Seattle. A follow-up film, encompassing scenes from Blackwell's life over the three decades since \"Streetwise,\" will be released with Mark's final book of photography later this fall. \nThat collection -- \"Tiny, Streetwise Revisited\" -- captures the vicissitudes of Blackwell's life from poverty and drug addiction to motherhood and stability. Its incredible scope represents the dedication of a photographer whose work is imbued with a palpable compassion, and the generosity of a subject willing to unclothe realities of life on the margins of society. \nIt was there -- with the down-and-out and the cast-off -- that both Mark and Blackwell felt at ease. Mark as the gritty photographer who found beauty and dignity in the mundane and brought a voice to the voiceless. And Blackwell, despite the degradations of addiction and desperation, as an indefatigable survivor. A transient by choice. \nMark and Bell, who never had children, offered to bring 14-year-old Blackwell to New York to live with them.

There were two exceptions: Halloween, when he dressed as Batman, and the suit he wore for a wedding.\nThe married Canadian air force pilot -- who was on parental leave for much of the year -- documented his #1year1outfit journey on \nhis blog\n and on \nsocial media\n. He gave shout-outs to the maker of his apparel for their durability. Three months in, he admitted that he really missed wearing denim in fall. \nHe learned about the versatility of clothing and how to live with less. He also discovered that he never again wants to live off 10 items of clothing.\n\"Wearing the same thing every day started to feel pretty tiresome sometime during the second quarter of my year,\" he said. \"I've been really looking forward to having some new clothes to wear.\" \nOut with the old, in with the new\nSouveny set out last year to simplify his life, starting with this wardrobe, and he's not the only one paring down. With the ubiquity of fast fashion and cheap home decor, many are finding it easy to hoard too many items. Thus the popularity of decluttering gurus like Marie Kondo and stunts such as Souveny's.\nPreviously, he thought he \"needed\" specific clothes for different activities: nice clothes for going out, work clothes, beach clothes, hiking clothes and so on.\n\"Living and traveling with only the clothes on my back, I realized that the right clothes can work in all of these situations, and if they are well-built, then spares and backups aren't required.\"\nSouveny spared no expense to ensure that his clothes would last. Some observers balked at the overall price tag of Souveny's capsule -- about $2,700, \nas one Redditor estimated\n, for top-of-the-line performance gear -- but he believes the exercise can be replicated on any budget as long as some attention has been paid to quality. \nSince he ended the one-year challenge in June, his wardrobe has grown to about 30 pieces, including shoes and formal wear. It's a lot less than he used to have, but it still feels \"overwhelming to have this much choice,\" he said.\nThe upshot of paring down? Now, he knows how to prioritize.\n\"I'm going to continue clearing out things that I don't wear, especially if I plan to make any future purchases, maintaining a small, manageable wardrobe,\" he said. \n'Focus on the more, not the less'\nThe desire to declutter tends to overlap with other first-world problems, like the rise of \nthe conscious consumer and transparent fashion\n, or the case for never spending less than \n$150 on a piece of clothing\n. But after you've evaluated every item in your home for its ability to spark joy and folded your clothes into rectangles, how do you avoid falling back into the same messy lifestyle?\nDecluttering your life can be like going on a diet: \"You get really excited and make changes, and then very quietly you go back to the clutter,\" said Courtney Carver, creator of \nProject 333\n, a minimalist fashion challenge to dress with 33 items or fewer for three months.\nCarver began shedding her possessions after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2006. By 2010, she had it down to a routine -- 33 items for three months, about every season -- and \nstarted writing about it\n.\nMuch like with dieting, the key is to choose a sustainable strategy. Like Kondo, Carver recommends starting by writing a personal mission statement of what you want to change or how you wish to see yourself by paring down. When things get tough, you can return to it for motivation.\nThe key is to go at your own pace, whether it's Kondo's KonMari method or 33 items at a time.\n\"Simplicity is much easier to stick with when you focus on the more, not the less,\" Carver said. \"You may have fewer items of clothing in your closet, but you have more space, more time to enjoy your morning, more opportunity to wear your favorite clothes. It's not just a change in environment; it's a change in mindset.\"\nIt takes constant \"recommitment\" each time you bring something new home, she said.\n\"People think, 'that's crazy; I could never do that,' \" she said. \"That's just fear because you never tried it before.\"\nBuild a sustainable model\nA few months into his challenge, Souveny read Kondo's best-selling book, \"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,\" and decided to apply the concept to the rest of his home, emptying his kitchen cupboards of superfluous gadgets and getting rid of the boxes piling up in his garage.\n\"It's not fun to have to go through all of that old stuff, but it feels liberating once it's gone,\" he said. \"I'm going to try to remember that any purchase I make, whether it's clothes, house stuff, sporting goods or electronic gadgets, will at some point need to be cleared out. If I can buy less and be more considerate about what I buy, hopefully I can reduce my contribution to the landfill and the workload of getting rid of it.\"\nOne's wardrobe might be the most intimate place to start a decluttering mission, but whether you embark on your journey in the closet or the kitchen, Souveny says, it's worth the trip.\n\"I think this concept of buying less and saving up to purchase better-quality things that you love can be applied to any budget. For myself anyways, now that I've built a wardrobe that I'm excited about, I have been saving money by not buying in bulk or impulse buying on sales.\"", "Officer replaces boy's stolen cards with awesome Pokemon haul": "Yes, the biggest trading card craze of the 90's is still going strong, and it still contains all of the high drama and friendship-ruining potential you remember. Take 9-year-old Bryce, who had his Pokemon collection snatched right out of his hands. \n\"I was stunned,\" Bryce told CNN. \"I couldn't move.\" \nOfficer Jimmy Grotenrath of the Cleveland Police Department's 4th District was\n \ncalled to look into the card-napping, and he felt for the boy. He, too, had collected Pokemon cards as a child.

He brought the cards back out and handed them over and apologized.\"\nHowever, some of the cards were still missing, and Bryce's disappointment led Grotenrath to do some nostalgic digging. \n\"I knew I had some old Pokemon cards at home,\" he said. \"So I looked in the closet and noticed a binder ... I told my sergeant and lieutenant I had some cards I wanted to give [this boy], so the next day my partner and I went back to his house.\"\nWhen Grotenrath rolled up with a binder full of original Pokemon cards, Bryce was beyond surprised. \n\"I was, number one, excited,\" Bryce said. \"I didn't think he was going to give them to me.

It's not a product, it's not a taste,\" explains my guide Massimo Cucchiara, who's from a family of truffle hunters that reaches back three generations. \n\"It's an emotion when you find it. It's an emotion when you eat it. I still remember my first truffle like I remember my first kiss.\"\nMassimo's garlicky scented mistress grows underground, close to the roots of oak, hazel, poplar and beech trees, and is only found in a handful of places around the world. \nIt's this rarity that makes it so prized. \nTruffles are one of the world's most expensive foods and the Italian white is the most valuable of all, with a market price of up to \u20ac4,000 ($4,400) per kilo. \nLike that heady first embrace, it's impossible to reproduce. \n\"It's nature that decides it,\" he explains. \"We can't cultivate the truffle.\"\nThe San Miniato Hills, with their mild Tuscan climate and soil rich in mineral salts, are the perfect breeding ground for top-quality truffles -- as well as the wine and olive oil for which the region is famous. \nBeware of imposters\nThe rarity and expense of the true white truffle means imposters are rife. \nChances are, if you've tasted white truffle you've been eating chemically enhanced tuber borchii -- an inferior Italian truffle similar in appearance but incomparable in taste. \nThe second-rate truffle is sprayed with a harsh artificial aroma that mimics the smell and taste. \n\"When I go into the restaurant and I get that smell I don't eat the truffle dish,\" says Massimo. \nAs for truffle oil -- most commercial oils are synthetic gloop unworthy of washing Pepe's paws. \n\"When you eat the pasta with the truffle oil you don't taste it with your mouth, you taste it with your nose.\"\nThe gentle, earthy taste of Italian white truffle is too subtle to be preserved in oil or cheese or meat. \nStriking gold \nMassimo's father, Salvatore, kneels down to unearth our first find of the day, brushing at the soil with his fingers with all the care of an archeologist on a dig. \nIt's a 25-gram golden-brown beauty, worth up to $100. \nIts firm texture, umber hue and marbled white-brown interior revealed along a nibbled edge all point to its freshness and ripeness. \nThen there's the gentle, earthy musk, which builds as it warms in the hand.\nWhen eaten, \"the taste is delicate in your mouth,\" says Massimo. \"The smell though, you could smell for days.\"\nDogs, not pigs \nHunters guess at where the year's harvest might be found by judging the weather, the earth and the plants.\nBut most of all, they rely on their dogs -- rather than the pigs of legend. \n\"It's the dog that teaches you,\" says Massimo. \"Every day you have a new lesson.\" \nPigs might have the sensitive snouts required for the job, but their use is banned in Italy because their overeager rooting damages the truffles' delicate mycelia, the spore-holding web necessary for the fungi's reproduction. \nAlso, it's pretty dangerous to get between a 300-kilogram pig and a truffle it's determined to eat. \nA particular set of skills \nPepe, our dog for today, is a mix of springer spaniel, Segugio Italiano and setter.  \nLike his owners, Pepe is from a long line of hunters. \nHis is a hardy mongrel combination that ensures energy, stamina and a keen sense of smell. \nWhile Massimo and I talk, Salvatore and Pepe walk ahead, communicating in a private language built up over nine years of working together.\n\"It's important to know your dog, have empathy,\" explains Massimo. \"You can speak about everything. After a while you speak about your problems!\"\nAncient pilgrim route\nSan Miniato is a quietly beautiful medieval hill town, centered around a tower fortress that commands views over the Arno Valley, with its cypress and olive trees. \nThe forest, wineries, and tiny villages of the San Miniato hills lie to the south, while to the north is busy industry. \nSanta Croce sull'Arno is the heartland of Italian leather manufacturing. \nAn ideally positioned base for exploring the cities of Florence, Pisa, Siena and Lucca, San Miniato is on the ancient Via Francigena pilgrim route that stretches from Canterbury, England, down to Rome. \nToday's pilgrims come for the annual truffle festival held here during the last three weekends in November, when the normally sleepy town fills with life. \nHonored with statues, lamented with funerals \nHere, truffles are honored with statues. \nThere's a bronze tribute in the town center to the world's largest truffle, a two-kilogram beast found in San Miniato in 1954. \nFuneral processions are held for them. \nIn 2004, a $52,000 truffle was at the center of a media storm after being bought by a London restaurant. \nWhen the truffle spoiled after being incorrectly stored, its remains were brought back to San Miniato for a lavish \nhomecoming lament\n. \nA lesson, then, in the importance of knowing how to care for and prepare the truffle. \nContinuing our journey from earth to plate, we visit Italian TV chef Gilberto Rossi at his restaurant \nPepenero\n, for a masterclass. \nHow to prepare the white truffle\n\"We never cook the white truffle,\" explains Gilberto, as he takes white truffle butter out of the fridge, ready to make tagliolini al tartufo. \nThe butter is made by mixing it with leftover truffle shavings and leaving it for a week for the flavor to take hold. \nBrash oils have no place here. \nButter, egg or mascarpone are the only suitors gentle enough to marry with the white truffle.\n\"If you don't know how to use the truffle, you kill the taste in a few minutes,\" adds Massimo.\nSimplicity is key. \nWhile the fresh tagliolini is dropped in boiling water, the eggs and butter are mixed to create a creamy base for the pasta. \nGilberto serves the pasta, swirling the strands around the spoon, then shaves about eight grams of San Miniato white truffle on top.\nWe eat it with \nL'Erede\n white sparkling wine from local winery Ivana Cupelli. \nA typical Tuscan Chianti would risk overwhelming the dish. \n\"Sometimes it doesn't work when you mix two diamonds,\" says Massimo. \nAnd the taste? \nHail to Gilberto, Massimo and all followers of the one true truffle. \nAs someone only previously acquainted with mid-range truffle oils, it's an awakening. \nThe next day at the San Miniato Truffle Festival, I eat two dishes prepared by volunteers from the local Truffle Association, served on plastic tableware inside a marquee.\nThey couldn't have tasted better if they'd been served on gold platters by diamante unicorns. \nFirst, carpaccio of Tuscan Chianina beef, seasoned with lemon juice, salt and pepper, and served with valeriana salad, pine nuts and shavings of white truffle and Parmesan. \nOn the side, white bread spread with soft mascarpone cheese and topped with a sliver of truffle.\nAnd then for seconds -- because there always should be seconds -- there's silky, creamy risotto, flavored with broth and seasoned with salt and pepper, and crowned with generous flakes of Tuscan gold. \nTruffle seasons \nWhite truffle season lasts from October to late December or early January. \nA truffle can be stored, wrapped in paper in the fridge, but only for up to 10 days. \nSo when they're gone, they're gone. \nIn the meantime, there's the Italian black winter truffle, in season from December to March, and the black summer truffle, found from May to September. \n\"We go hunting all year,\" says Massimo. \nThe truffles change, and the dogs change -- Pepe turns his nose up at black truffles, so one of his siblings will step in.\nBut the hunt goes on. \nTruffle in Tuscany tailor make truffle hunting and tasting experiences led by Massimo Cucchiara, from \u20ac65 per person ($71) for two to four people; \ntruffleintuscany.it\n; +39 347 903 0371\nChef Gilberto Rossi offers cook-and-eat sessions in his San Miniato restaurant followed by a truffle hunt, from \u20ac180 per person ($198) for groups of eight to 20; \nPepenero\n; Via IV Novembre, 13 56028, San Miniato; +39 0571 419523\nSerenella Barbieri offers private, three-hour guided tours of the San Miniato Truffle Festival from \u20ac130 per group of up to 30 people ($143); serenella.barbieri@alice.it; +39 347 0740223\nTo Tuscany offers villa rentals across the region; \nGallo 1\n, near Montopoli in Val d'Arno, starts at $537 per week; \nto-tuscany.com\n; 0121 286 7782", "The difference between grilling and barbecue": "I embraced \"y'all\" with ease for its gender neutrality. Sweet tea somehow made sense, too. But it took years for me to let go of the habit of declaring a \"barbecue\" every time I decided to cook hamburgers, steaks or hot dogs on the grill.\nA friend from Memphis was the first to call me out. Surely, I meant I was going to \"grill out,\" he said. \nBarbecue involves slabs of meat cooking for hours -- in a grill, in a smoker or maybe in the ground, depending on one's level of enthusiasm. Grilling meat or vegetables for minutes at a time, he said, does not a barbecue make.\nIt would take years for me to see it his way (or, more likely, give up the fight) after learning what barbecue means to the South. There are rankings and contests and immutable beliefs about who does it best, all dependent on where you live and who your parents are -- much like the origin of my linguistic confusion. \nAn email from my mother about her Memorial Day weekend says it all: \"We had our first barbecue of the season: hot dogs, hamburgers and marinated chicken.\"\nWhether you call it barbecue, BBQ or Q, it's more than a way of cooking, it's myth, folklore, and American history, to quote culinary historian Sylvia Lovegren. Rather than rehash all that grist and grizzle, let's look at something fairly basic: the difference between grilling and barbecue.\n'Low and slow'\nExperts at the \nAtlanta Food and Wine Festival\n in May offered clarity. In a nutshell, the difference is temperature and time. \nGrilling is done over direct heat at high temperatures, said cookbook author Matt Lee, one half of the \nLee Bros\n.\n\"Grilling is all about getting that quick sear with high temperatures,\" he said.\nBarbecue, on the other hand, is both a noun and a discipline, typically left to an esteemed member of the community because of the time commitment, \"usually, Uncle Larry,\" Lee said.\nBarbecue is cooked \"low and slow,\" said pitmaster \nChris Lilly of Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q\n in Decatur, Alabama, who was inducted into the Alabama Barbecue Hall of Fame in June. Barbecue is cooked over coals at low temperatures using indirect heat by pushing coals to one zone of the cooker and the meat to another zone.\nChef \nDavid Bancroft of Acre\n in Auburn, Alabama, concurred.\n\"When I am hosting a barbecue, I serve delicious smoked meats mopped down with homemade barbecue sauce. If we aren't hosting a barbecue, then we might be grilling juicy steaks. Barbecue, for my family, is low and slow cooking, where grilling is intense direct heat,\" he said.\nBut barbecue is more than a technique, Lilly added. It's an experience.\n\"If I invite you to a barbecue, you better bring a pillow and blanket because it's a whole weekend affair,\" said Lilly. \"It's about family and community.\"\nFrom George Washington to Lyndon B. Johnson and many more in between, American politicians saw value in this definition of barbecue, using them as excuses for parties and events for political glad-handing.\nLike many American traditions, they drew inspiration from existing cultures.\nBlame it on the BBQ sauce\nSpanish conquistadors reported seeing Taino-Arawak and Carib natives in Hispaniola roasting, drying and smoking meat \"on wooden frameworks over small beds of coals,\" Lovegren wrote in the article \"Barbecue\" for the June 2003 volume of \nAmerican Heritage\n.\nThe framework was called a babracot, which the Spaniards turned into the word \"barbacoa,\" Lovegren wrote. The first European arrivals in America also found natives barbecuing \"south of the not-yet-delineated Mason-Dixon Line\" and took a liking to it.\nLovegren also concluded that barbecue is not grilling. It's not flipping burgers, searing a steak or basting chicken and ribs with barbecue sauce, as was the custom at my family barbecues in Long Island. It's cooking over low heat for hours, she said. \nBeyond that, questions such as what kind of meat to cook, for how long and in what kind of sauce will produce just as many opinions as varieties of BBQ sauce in the grocery aisle.\nTed Lee blames the sauce for the blending of the terms \"grilling\" and \"barbecue.\" As more prepared sauces came on the market in 1950s and 1960s with the growing popularity of outdoor grilling, more people started using the terms interchangeably, he said.\nSigns of \"barbecue\" being used interchangeably with grilling began to emerge before then.\nSunset, a West Coast-oriented magazine, published \"Sunset's Barbecue Book\" in 1939 to capitalize on the early popularity of barbecuing in the West, \nauthor Tim Miller wrote\n in \"The Birth of the Patio Daddy-O: Outdoor Grilling in Postwar America\" in 2010 for the Journal of American Culture.\nMiller also dug up a reference from food writer \nClementine Paddleford\n, who traveled to five Western states in 1956 and visited dozens of homes as a popular food columnist.\n\"Everywhere the Barbecue. No longer a new thing, once a fad, now a 'solid' in the way of entertaining. I doubt if ever again fried meats will be in the running,\" she wrote.\n\"Almost every Western home has an outdoor barbecue and usually a second built into the kitchen for cold weather use. Now the barbecue moves into smart dining rooms in restaurants. Charcoal broiled meats are featured served from the barbecue centered in the dining room and presided over by a chef in high hat.\"\nBy then, outdoor grilling was a national fad, propelled by trends in American culture that made grilling a steak in the backyard not just an option \"but a cooking destination,\" Miller wrote. More than other methods of cooking, outdoor grilling afforded families and friends a time to socialize -- another popular American pastime -- while affirming gender roles.\n\"The rise of suburbs, the popularity of the outdoors and the West, and new perceptions of the role of men in the family -- all of these things contributed to the spectacular popularity of outdoor grilling,\" Miller wrote.\nApart from references attributed to his sources, Miller was careful to avoid using the terms interchangeably, \"in order to avoid arguments between barbecue aficionados,\" he said in a footnote to the article.\n\"While the terms barbecuing and grilling are often considered to be synonymous, it is more precise to say that barbecuing is a type of grilling.\"\nAll of that makes sense to me. Like anything, it's best to know your audience. As long as I'm living in the South, I'll keep barbecue separate from grilling.\nWhat's your take?

Not the dozens of interested buyers who contacted Karen Schoeve after she posted the ad in March, reluctantly putting her beloved bison Bullet -- all 1,100 pounds of her -- on the market for $5,960.\nThe Argyle, Texas, woman even received an offer from someone saying they were willing to pay $10,000.  But Schoeve told CNN that money wasn't a factor. She wanted a buyer who would give Bullet the human interaction she needed.\nSchoeve said her 7-year-old bison has a special bond with humans, because she was imprinted with humans since her birth. \nEven though Bullet lived outside she was known to make her presence inside Schoeve's home whenever she wanted. The bison sometimes came in through a door that the wind blew open and roamed around the house. Bullet never relieved herself inside, though, she said.\n\"She was just being curious,\" Shoeve said. \"She just loved to smell everything.\"\nBison officially the 'national mammal' of the United States\nSchoeve had a dream of opening up an animal education center with her husband when she bought Bullet two years ago. But the couple separated, and with the divorce her dream came crashing down. She had to downsize to a 3-acre home, leaving Bullet with not much room to roam.\n\"I wanted to keep her, but I knew I needed to let go of her,\" Schoeve told CNN. She also has had to sell several horses. \"I am starting over completely and I am just trying to dig myself out,\" she said.\nAfter months of searching, Schoeve found a new home for Bullet only a few miles away. It feels like a perfect fit: The new owners -- who wish to remain anonymous -- have a big pasture for Bullet to play in and a few new roommates: two cows. \n\"When they met, one of the cows picked up a branch with leaves and laid it down in front of Bullet,\" said Schoeve. \"It was a peace offering.\"\nBullet was introduced to her new home on Saturday. Schoeve has become friends with Bullet's new owners, who gave her a key and have urged her to come visit whenever she wants.\nSchoeve said when she went to leave on Saturday, Bullet came running all the way across the pasture to say goodbye.\n\"She walks around the pasture then she looks back at me,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"It was like Bullet was asking if it was OK.\"", "The library catalog card? Time to pull it from the files": "On Thursday, the Online Computer Library Center, the Ohio-based company that had printed catalog cards for public and university libraries for more than 40 years, \nsaid it had just printed its last batch\n.\nCause of death: online technology, of course.\n\"Cards were such an incredibly helpful innovation when they were invented,\" said Skip Prichard, president and CEO of the center, a nonprofit library cooperative that provides a variety of programs and technology services. It was, in fact, formed as a way for libraries to consolidate and share card-making resources; beforehand, libraries would often make their own cards.\nBut, he adds, libraries have changed.\n\"This is just one of the many indicators that the world continues to march forward into the digital age,\" he said.\nMany people under 30 have probably never seen a card catalog, much less used one. These days, they're the kinds of objects used as decorative furniture at Pottery Barn or as antique curios in hipsters' households.\nBut for decades, the wood or metal cabinets and their thousands of cardboard index cards were, essentially, the library's information center. \nWith their compilations of (sometimes handwritten) titles, authors, brief descriptions and classification numbers -- Dewey Decimal for many public libraries, Library of Congress for universities and research institutions -- they were the necessary finding aid to the numerous books beyond.\nIn \na 1994 New Yorker essay\n, Nicholson Baker -- who later wrote a book, \n\"Double Fold,\"\n about \npaper destruction\n -- saw them as more than just information. With their notes, cross-references and scribbles, they were history as well.\n\"Think of an unbound manuscript, the only one like it, composed of a great many leaves of three-by-five cardboard,\" he wrote. \"It is, then, the accreted biography of an institution whose job it is to store and retrieve books and book-like materials.\"  \nBut even then, the physical card catalog was going the way of the vacuum-tube television and cassette Walkman. \nThe Online Computer Library Center's card production peaked in 1985, when it printed 131 million cards. It used to ship up to 8 tons a week. Last year, it printed fewer than 1 million cards.\nBaker's article was a lament for all the card catalogs then being digitized (by the Online Computer Library Center, among others) and being put online and the loss of the cards, with their handwritten references accumulated over decades.\nBut creating cards was a laborious process, \nPrichard wrote in a blog entry\n. \n\"Each book required, in many cases, multiple cards: one for subject, one for author, one for title. They had to be hand typed,\" he wrote. \"Any small error required a complete redo.\"\nThe Internet, which has made it possible for people to scan library catalogs from their home or phone (as well as read items in Google Books instead of wading through bound volumes of the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature), sealed the deal.\n\"We've already jumped into the new world,\" said Nevine Haider, Concordia College Library head of technical services, in an Online Computer Library Center statement. \"We've had online public access to our collection for years. The print card catalog has served as our back-up. So we're ready to move on.\"\nConcordia is among the last institutions receiving catalog cards, the news release noted.\nAmong the last cards printed were one for a book about \"Sleeping Beauty\" and one for the film \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" Prichard said. They're indicative of the range of offerings available at libraries -- now searchable with the click of a mouse, not the flick of index cards.\nThe demise of the catalog card will have an immediate impact at the Online Computer Library Center. For years, the organization, which strives to be environmentally conscious, would use some of the funds from recycling paper for a weekly doughnut run. Now, there will be much less paper to recycle.\nThe doughnuts, however, aren't going anywhere, said Prichard.\n\"That's a tradition we're continuing,\" he said.", "How to increase thankfulness and why it's good for your health": "In other words, there are some very practical reasons to get into the spirit of things, by taking a minute to remember the reasons you're #blessed. These are lessons that can be applied year-round.\nYou'll get some decent sleep for once\nFor a 2011 \npaper\n in Applied Psychology, researchers asked a group of study participants to keep a gratitude journal (something many of the studies on this subject have in common). These participants were all students who said they had trouble sleeping \"because their minds are racing with stimulating thoughts and worries,\" the researchers write.\nFor 15 minutes before going to sleep, the students were instructed to write about the things they were thankful for in a journal. After a week of this, these students reported both quieter minds at night and improved sleep than they'd experienced before starting their gratitude journals. (\nBing Crosby\n was way ahead of the game here.)\nRelated: Just say 'thank you' to the people you work with\nYou'll be happier\nGiving someone a long overdue thank-you will increase your own happiness, and the mood-boosting effects of that simple act of gratefulness could last as long as a month. That's according to a study led by Martin Seligman, the pioneer of the modern positive-psychology movement. Seligman gave a series of six tasks to more than 400 people to test different ways of improving people's moods: Some participants were instructed to reflect on and write about their personal strengths, for example, while others were told to think about their personal strengths and find new ways to use them every day for a week.\nJust one of those six tasks involved gratitude: The participants were asked if there was someone in their lives who was once particularly kind to them, but whom they never properly thanked. They then were instructed to write and hand-deliver a thank-you letter to this person. In the end, the gratitude task had the biggest impact on the participants' happiness, and the effects were still measurable when the researchers checked in a month later.\nYou might actually even exercise\nOnce a week for ten weeks, \nresearchers\n instructed study participants to list five things that had happened over the previous seven days that they were grateful for; another group was told to write about the five things that had most annoyed them that week; and a third was instructed to simply write about things that had happened, with no emotion attached. Not surprising, by the end of the experiment, those who'd done the gratitude exercise were more likely to feel optimistic about their lives. But they also reported exercising more than the people who'd spent the past two and a half months making a weekly list of grievances.\nRelated: Why you shouldn't race through those Thank-You notes\nYou'll appreciate your partner more, even if you're imagining things\nFor two weeks, researchers told 65 cohabiting couples to keep nightly diaries, jotting down the nice things that they'd done for their partners and that their partners had done for them. As you'd expect, when the researchers checked in with their subjects after this little experiment, the couples reported feeling closer to their partners and more satisfied with the relationship than they had before the study started. (The researchers call the tactic a \"booster shot\" for romantic relationships.)\nBut what's also interesting is this: When the researchers compared the diaries, they found the stories they told didn't always match up; sometimes, one half of the couple reported being grateful for something the other half didn't mention. It doesn't matter if their partner actually did something kind for their sake, just that they perceived an action that way.\nYour underlings will work a little harder\nIn a recent study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers visited a call center at a university, where employees call alumni to ask for donations. They observed one group of fund-raising employees on a regular day, noting how many calls they made. On a different day, the researchers observed a separate group of fund-raisers \u2014 but before they began working, the director of the department gave a little speech noting how thankful she was to the fund-raisers. That day, these employees made about 50 percent more calls than the previous group. Managers, never underestimate the power a simple thank-you has over your minions.\nRelated: Why you should write a letter to yourself tonight", "Practicing Islam in Catholic Cuba": "\"When I learned there was Islam and a Muslim community, I really liked it because I never heard of it,\" Alvado said. \"It was breaking all the preconceived ideas that we have about Cuban society.\"\nAn estimated 85% of Cubans are Catholic. But only 0.1% of the population -- just a few thousand people -- are Muslim, according to a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center \n(PDF)\n.\nAlvado says almost all of them are converts.\n\"That applies to absolutely everybody in (my photo) series,\" he said. \"Many of them were Christians before or some other religion, or a few of them were atheists as well.\"\nHe says the reasons for conversion vary. While some people view Islam as \"a little bit more true or pure religion than others,\" there are those who turn to Islam for more personal and specific reasons. \nHe provided the example of how Islam might be positive for those who have problems with alcohol, as Islam is a way for them to avoid alcohol. The Quran forbids the consumption of intoxicants and alcoholic beverages. \nThere are challenges, though, that come with practicing Islam in a country where it's such a drastic minority. One of the main ones is finding a place to worship.\n\"The communities are being organized in very, very small groups, and someone in each group will offer their home on Fridays (to pray) or something like that,\" he said.\nAlvado says Cuban Muslims are constantly learning about their new religion and evolving together.\n\"Everyone is doing a little bit of their own interpretation on how to read (Islamic) rules and be with them, more or less, and that's interesting,\" he said.\nOne of his photos, No. 11 in the gallery above, shows a woman struggling to put on an Islamic scarf.\n\"This woman had been Christian all her life, really a devoted Christian for many, many years of her life,\" he said. \"That's why, for me, (the photo series) is really speaking about identity and confusion.\"\nAlvado adds that this project was just as much of a learning experience for him.\n\"I have learned more things about Islam and Islamic beliefs and their ideas in Havana than working in Turkey,\" the Spanish photographer said.\nCuba is a spiritual and passionate city, he said, especially when it comes to religion. In the beginning, he wasn't sure how people would react to him wanting to photograph their lives. Working to develop a mutual respect and being open about his intents from the outset -- such as by making sure his subjects knew he is atheist -- was a significant part of his work.\nAlvado says he will visit Cuba again later this year. When he told some of the people he photographed that he hopes to publish these images in a book one day, he says they reacted with excitement at the idea that other people would be able to see their experiences as Muslims in Cuba.\n\"I felt that they are wanting their story to be told, and it didn't happen before,\" Alvado said. \"To see that they have these expectations about what can come out of it, it made me have a reflection about myself. You also have some sort of responsibility towards them about what you are going to do with this.\"", "Does photo show outlaw Jesse James with his killer?": "\"This photo was taken when the two men trusted each other and the younger Robert Ford wanted a picture of himself with the man who had become a legend in his own time,\" Lois Gibson said on her Facebook page.\nThe undated photo shows both men seated on chairs next to each other, with Ford on James' right.\nFord, a member of James' gang, shot the notorious outlaw in the back of the head in 1882 to collect the $10,000 bounty. He was shot to death himself in 1892, according to the Missouri State Historical Society.\nGibson, a forensic artist for the Houston Police Department, said she rigorously compared the photo to known pictures of the two men and concluded that it is genuine.\nThe tintype belongs to Sandra Mills, who lives north of Spokane, Washington. She says the photo was passed down to her from her grandmother in 2003 with instructions to sell it and buy some land. Family lore says her ancestors used to shelter James and his gang from time to time. \nMills told the Houston Chronicle that she has tried doing selling the photo over the years, but nobody would believe that the image was genuine.\n\"I'm just a farm girl, so nobody wanted to listen,\" the newspaper quoted her as saying. \"We got no respect from anybody.\"\nThe photo could be extremely valuable, an official with a Boston auction house told the Chronicle.\n\"If it's authentic, it's a real wow,\" the newspaper quoted Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, as saying. \"It's compelling, but I would want to see much more analysis.\"\n8 outlaw adventures around the U.S.", "Defying church ban, dozens of Methodist clergy come out": "In a public letter posted online, 111 pastors, deacons, elders and candidates for ministry said church rules require \"that we not bring our full selves to ministry, that we hide from view our sexual orientations and gender identities.\"\n\"While some of us have been lucky to serve in places where we could serve honestly and openly, there are others in places far more hostile, who continue to serve faithfully even at tremendous cost to themselves, their families, and yes, even the communities they serve, who do not receive the fullness of their pastor's gifts because a core part must remain hidden,\" \nthe letter continues\n. \nThe self-outing came one day before the United Methodist Church, one of the nation's largest Protestant denominations, convenes its quadrennial General Conference in Portland, Oregon.\nFrom May 10-20, more than 800 delegates will debate changes to church policy, including several that seek to lift longstanding bans on LGBT ministers and same-sex marriages. This is the first Methodist General Conference since the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. \nA spokesman for Reconciling Ministries Network, an LGBT advocacy group that organized the letter, said that about 80% of the 111 signatories are coming out to their supervisors for the first time. In addition to gay and lesbian clergy, the letter was also signed by intersex and transgender pastors, who are not technically excluded from ministry.   \nThe Rev. Laura Young, a 48-year-old pastor from Westerville, Ohio, said signing the letter lifted a spiritual burden. \n\"I feel lighter already,\" she said in an interview on Monday. \"I can be a better pastor and a better person when I can be my full self, living in the light and with integrity.\" \nYoung, a mother of two, said she has been \"just about as out as you can be,\" but has never officially informed Methodist officials about her sexuality, a situation she compared to the military's erstwhile \"don't ask/don't tell\" policy. \nBishop Gregory Palmer of West Ohio, Young's bishop, did not immediately return a call asking for comment.\nMonday's missive follows a similar letter issued by \n15 Methodist ministers in New York\n, who also openly acknowledged that they are gay or lesbian.   \nThe United Methodists' Book of Discipline states that all people are of \"sacred worth\"  but denounces the \"practice of homosexuality\" as \"incompatible with Christian teaching.\" \nOpenly gay and lesbian clergy members can be removed from ministry. A Kansas minister who came out to her congregation in January, for example, \nnow faces a church trial\n. Such trials can be hard to prosecute, however. In 2011, a church court declined to discipline a lesbian pastor because she refused to answer \npersonal questions about her sexuality. \nIn some parts of the United States, including Baltimore and New York, openly gay clergy serve with few if any restrictions. Conservatives argue that such policies threaten to break up the church into small, self-governing branches.  \n\"Many traditionalists in the church could not accept being part of a denomination that would reverse or abandon our denomination's teaching on marriage and sexuality,\" \nsaid the Rev. Thomas Lambrecht\n, a United Methodist minister and activist. \"This is a recipe for schism or separation.\"\nFor decades, liberal Methodists have tried -- and failed -- to change church rules on homosexuality, and it may prove impossible again at this month's General Conference. While American Methodists are diverse -- both George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton are members -- Methodists in Africa tend towards conservative views on sexual ethics, arguing that Scripture prohibits same-sex relationships. \nThe United Methodist Church has about 7 million members in the U.S. and nearly 5 million in Africa, where the faith is reportedly growing fast. Some 40% of the delegates at the General Conference in Portland will be from overseas. \nA council of African bishops\n issued a statement last September\n urging Methodists to \"submit to the teachings of Scripture that God designed marriage to be between man and woman.\" \nThe United Methodist Church is one of the few \"mainline\" Protestant denominations -- so called because of their deep American roots and historical influence -- to continue to bar same-sex marriages and LGBT clergy. In recent years, the following denominations have voted to lift such bans: the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.", "New flavor of Oreos hits stores": "Oreo cinnamon bun flavored cookies have officially hit the market. \nThis particular product is new for the cookie line, but buzz has been circling around its release date for the past three months.\nImages of the new flavor were spotted on social media \nthis past September\n.

Before Week 36 of this yearlong journey through the Bible. \nDuring my senior year of college, I wrote an art history paper in one night with the assistance of a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola. \nIn the last two weeks, while trudging through Ezekiel, those old feelings came back. I did everything I could to not read the Bible.\nIn Week 35, I listed off how many more prophets I had to read and much more of the Old Testament was left. I sort of freaked out.\nI went days without picking up the book. I published my last post over three weeks ago. \nThere wasn't any good reason to be blamed for my lack of reading. I just didn't want to do it. Ezekiel seemed endless. The inclusion of the number of cubits needed to build the New Temple almost put me over the edge.\nI had been there before and I didn't like Kings much the first time.\nBut over the weekend, I met two people I hadn't seen in many years, and without even knowing it, they both encouraged me. Each of them said that while not Catholic, they enjoyed my writing and this project. They were reading.\nIt was my sign to get my act together.\nAnd as I started the book of Daniel, it got me thinking about how writer's block had happened before to me. I had felt frustrated. Previously, I had sought \"professional guidance\" from priests and rabbis to make things clearer and more understandable. \nBut, this time, I just needed time to work it through and think. The book of Daniel was the life raft that I needed. \nDaniel is the story of a young boy who serves kings and provides them the wisdom of worship of God -- again, they better listen to him or else. \nI am sure that anyone else writing this might have focused on what happened with Daniel and the lion. But, that was an easy story that I already knew.\nInstead, my favorite is the one found in Chapter 3, which focuses on Daniel's three friends: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. I didn't know that Daniel had three others with him.\nThose three tell King Nebuchadnezzar that he is doomed for worshipping a false idol.\nNebuchadnezzar, of course, doesn't like their message, and sends the trio burn in the hottest of ovens (Fire -- a great fear of mine, almost equal to locusts).\nBut, as they go into the fire, they don't burn. They aren't even singed, because of their faith in God.\nThey dance around praising the Lord. It goes on for 38 verses. A lot of inanimate objects praise God, as in verse 70, \"Ice and snow bless the Lord; praise and exalt him above all forever.\" \nOr in verse 80, \"You birds of the air, bless the Lord.\" \nIt's kind of catchy. \nThe three friends of Daniel survive the fire and get promoted into better \"jobs\" for Nebuchadnezzar when he realized the error of his ways.\nWhen I got to this line at the end of Chapter 3, I thought about my two friends, and it was a reminder of why I have loved this last year:  \n\"How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders; his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endures through all generations.\" \nAnd with that, I am back to work.

That forced Qatar Airways passengers to deplane Wednesday via mobile stairs and shuttle buses. \nAtlanta's airport has only one gate that can accommodate the A380 -- the world's largest airliner. The airport and resident hub carrier Delta Air Lines said they could not make that gate available. \nThe very public battle between Delta Air Lines, the world's second largest airline, and competitor Qatar Airways represents a microcosm of the national debate over whether the amount of alleged government subsidies foreign airlines receive violates international Open Skies agreements. \nHundreds of Qatar passengers were inconvenienced in Atlanta. Some wanted to know who to blame for not having a jetway where they could deplane. The airport and Delta blamed the airline for not giving enough notice that it was sending a Super Jumbo to an airport with only one gate that could handle such a big plane. \n\"It is a part of the common use lease agreement that we have,\" said airport spokesman Reese McCranie. \"We have to be given a certain amount of time when there is an equipment swap.\"\nFour to six Delta aircraft needed access to the A380 gate at the time the Qatar Airways plane requested access. \n\"... there wasn't anywhere Delta could put them,\" McCranie added.\nDelta offered as a \"solution\" a scenario that included parking the A380 on a remote stand near the international terminal. \"Despite limited time to solve for the request, Delta offered solutions to allow Qatar to use the gates while ensuring our own schedule remained accommodated during a heavy traffic period at the international terminal,\" Delta said in a written statement. \n\"Delta applies for accommodations months in advance,\" a Delta spokeswoman said. \"Qatar did not do that when asking for the A380.\" The A380 was scheduled for the flight at least a month in advance, according to several widely published reports. \nWhen asked if the airline gave enough notice to schedule access to the gate, Gunter Saurwein, Qatar Airways' vice president for the Americas, smiled and said, \"In general yes, we gave some lead time that we would be here.\" \nWhen asked if Delta may have deliberately prevented Qatar from using the gate, Sawrwein said, \"I do not want to comment on that. We as an airline don't finger point.\" \nThe crew deplaned the double-decker jet's 517 passengers in 45 minutes, including some disabled travelers. Although that's much longer than it usually takes to deplane via a jetway, Sawrwein described it as a success under the circumstances. \nLater, the outbound A380 flight experienced a two hour delay due to the same gate situation. \nUsing the Super Jumbo for this flight was a one-off for Qatar Airways' inaugural, making the gate dilemma unlikely to occur again on this route. Future Qatar Airways flights between Doha and Atlanta are scheduled to use Boeing 777-200LRs, which will have access to an airport gate and jetway. \nU.S. carriers claim that Qatar Airways and other Persian Gulf airlines receive billions of dollars in subsidies and have done so for many years, if not decades. They also allege that government handouts to Gulf carriers have enabled the funding of new routes and new aircraft.\nWhile Delta accuses Qatar of improperly using subsidies to fund new routes, many argue that Qatar offers passengers a higher quality experience at a more competitive price.\nThe feud between the two carriers escalated last March when Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said he'd launched the Atlanta route \"to rub salt into the wounds of Delta.\"", "The week in 33 photos": "Take a look at 33 photos of the week from May 20 through May 27.", "Look at me! 15 must-see selfies from May": "Take a look at some selfies taken by celebrities during the month of May.", "Mom calls 911 to rescue son": "\"He's dragging my son!

I need someone to contact the zoo please.\"\nThe 911 operator informs her help is on the way -- another spectator at the zoo had also called. The mother can be heard calling down to the boy -- \"be calm, be calm!  be calm, be calm\" -- apparently as Harambe, a silverback gorilla, stands the boy up, looks him over and tugs up his pants.\nThen the fear heightens in her voice as Harambe drags the boy through the water in the moat.

After 10 minutes, zoo personnel shot and killed the animal. \n\"We continue to praise God for His grace and mercy, and to be thankful to the Cincinnati Zoo for their actions taken to protect our child,\" the boy's family said. \n\"We are also very appreciative for the expressions of concern and support that have been sent to us. Some have offered money to the family, which we do not want and will not accept.

It is not related to the operation or safety of the Cincinnati Zoo, authorities said.\n\"After the review, we will determine if charges need to be brought forward,\" police spokeswoman Tiffaney Hardy said. \n\"If it is determined charges need to be brought forward, we would then discuss it with the Hamilton County prosecutor's office.\" The prosecutor's office declined to say how long the investigation might take.\nAuthorities have said the boy's mother was with the child when he slipped past a fence and tumbled into the moat. \nThe parents are cooperating with police and are still evaluating whether they will seek legal representation, family spokeswoman Gail Myers said. \nAfter gorilla shooting, are zoos becoming 'obsolete'?\nCritics united in grief\nHarambe's name is Swahili for come together in unity for a common cause. And critics have rallied together against the gorilla's killing.\nUproar and vitriol has poured in, especially on social media against the boy's mother after zoo officials killed the western lowland silverback to protect the boy.\nOpinion: Should parents leash their toddlers?\nSome suggested the boy's parents\n should be held criminally responsible.\n An online petition seeking \"\nJustice for Harambe\n\" earned more than 100,000 signatures in less than 48 hours.\n\"This beautiful gorilla lost his life because the boy's parents did not keep a closer watch on the child,\" the petition states.\nWho's to blame for Harambe's death?\nKimberly Ann Perkins O'Connor, who saw the incident, said the boy told his mother he was going to get into the moat. The mother told her son to behave before she became distracted by other children with her, O'Connor said. \n\"The little boy himself had already been talking about wanting to go in, go in, get in the water and his mother is like, 'No you're not, no you're not,' \" O'Connor said. \"Her attention was drawn away for seconds, maybe a minute, and then he was up and in before you knew it.\"\n'The child is safe'\nThane Maynard, the zoo's director, has firmly stood by the decision to kill the gorilla. \n\"We are all devastated that this tragic accident resulted in the death of a critically endangered gorilla,\"  Maynard said. \nHowever, he said, those second-guessing the call don't understand the animal.\n\"That child's life was in danger. People who question that don't understand you can't take a risk with a silverback gorilla -- this is a dangerous animal,\" he said. \"Looking back, we'd make the same decision.

The safari group pulled off the road to capture some photos.\nAt the same time, a woman not with the tour group quickly approached the elk by foot. She appeared to be holding up a mobile device in a video captured by Tibbitts' videographer, Manny Perez. \nTibbitts called to the woman, telling her not to get any closer, when the animal charged. \nPerez recorded the moment when the elk started running toward the unidentified woman, who fell and avoided being struck.\n\"She fell down before the elk came close enough to hitting her, and when that happened the elk backed away,\" Tibbitts said. \nA female elk can  \nweigh as much as 500 pounds\n, which means the animal can cause serious injuries, even death, if it feels its offspring have been threatened, Tibbitts said. \nThe 45-year-old, who has lived close to the national park his whole life, said he has noticed a shift in the way people behave with wildlife. \n\"Prior to having high definition cameras in our pockets, people seemed more courteous to animals,\" said Tibbitts, who has been a tour guide for 25 years. \"It seems like people are being more brave and taking more chances and not thinking about the consequences.\"\nYellowstone National Park published an advisory on its Facebook page days before the elk incident, urging park visitors to stay vigilant. \n\"Be careful out there: elk calving season has begun! Elk sometimes hide their calves in unexpected places, and defend them aggressively,\" the post reads.\nPeople gone wild\nThere have been a number of incidents of visitors interacting badly with wild animals at the park in the last year. \nEarlier in May, visitors with misplaced intentions put a newborn bison calf in their car because they feared it was cold. When park officials tried to reunite the animal with its herd, the calf was rejected. \nIt later had to be euthanized\n  because it was abandoned.\n\"Its sad conclusion highlights the importance of keeping a safe distance from park wildlife,\" park officials \nsaid on Facebook. \nIn May 2015, a 16-year-old girl from Taiwan\n was gored by a bison\n while posing for a group photo. \n\"The girl turned her back to the bison to have her picture taken when the bison lifted its head, took a couple steps and gored her,\" the Park Service said at the time.\nThe teenager suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries. \nEven natural gems at the park have been marred by tourists. In 2014, a visitor crashed a drone into the park's largest hot spring.  The unmanned aircraft is \nprohibited from all Park Service-controlled areas\n throughout the country.\nTibbitts, who has spent almost every summer of his life at Yellowstone, wants to avoid situations that put animals and people at risk. He said he hopes visitors can learn to respect wildlife.\nAs for the woman in the video, Tibbitts said she was physically fine after her close encounter with the elk, but he couldn't say the same thing about her feelings. \n\"I think it was her pride that was hurt the most,\" he said.", "U.S. military photos from April": "More than 1.3 million people serve in the five branches of the U.S. armed forces.

Susana Martinez, there's one thing in common about the mounting Trump controversies: The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is aiming to make the entire 2016 campaign about himself.\nAmerican politics is littered with larger-than-life personalities. But no presidential candidate in living memory has built a campaign so exclusively on the foundation of his own personal, brand, self-congratulatory rhetoric and life story as Trump. And don't expect anything different if he makes it to the White House.\n\"You think I'm going to change?\" he told reporters at a press conference this week. \"I'm not going to change.\"\nTrump vs. the press\nTrump has prospered by being the loudest, most unapologetic salesman of self in politics that most seasoned observers have ever seen. He is not just the figurehead of his own campaign -- his personality is the campaign, as evidenced by stump speeches, press conferences and endless television and radio interviews that add up to an unstoppable torrent of self-promotion. \n\"The Trump campaign is not about any cause, it is all about Trump,\" said Peter Wehner, who has watched candidates and presidents up close as an aide in the last three Republican administrations. \"His campaign is all about him. How he treats other people is all about him -- whether one is praised and patted on the head or cruelly mocked depends on what you have said about him.\"\nTrump's self-aggrandizement has become a dominant theme of the presidential campaign.\nThe billionaire boasts about his wealth, his portfolio of gleaming buildings and golf resorts, soaring poll numbers, the size of his crowds, his \"crazy\" television ratings, how Mexicans will love him, how his book is an all time best-seller and how his 757 jet is superior to Air Force One.\nEgo-driven strategy\nIt's an ego-driven strategy that would doom most politicians.\nBut, so far, Trump's unique, personal and unconventional campaign style has worked. He's dispatched his rivals in a bloated Republican field and is now locked in a tight general election duel with Hillary Clinton. His style could even help him win over disaffected workers who also seem themselves as victimized by the political and economic establishment.\nStill, there are major questions about whether a personality-driven campaign -- lacking the traditional organizational and field skills -- can be successful during a complex national contest.\nThe Clinton campaign is working overtime to make Trump's personal mythologizing look like a fatal flaw. The former secretary of state is mounting a two-pronged strategy that centers directly on Trump's persona. She hopes to make a case that his volatile personality makes him unsuitable to be commander-in-chief and to use incidents from his colorful character and business career to deconstruct Trump's carefully built self image.\n\"He is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump University,\" \nClinton said Wednesday\n, referring to the growing scrutiny surrounding Trump's namesake training programs. \nClinton will keep up the attacks Thursday during a\n foreign policy speech \nin San Diego. An aide said Clinton will use the address to \"rebuke the fear, bigotry and misplaced defeatism that Trump has been selling to the American people.\"\nTrump's allies dismiss the idea that his campaign style lacks the gravitas and temperament required of a President, arguing that his tirades against the press, for instance, are merely a result of unfair coverage. \n'A temperament question'\n\"Many of the reporters know the facts, but choose to write horrible stories about him or portray him in a negative light,\" Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson told CNN's \"New Day\" on Wednesday, adding that if Trump becomes President he will have wide public support. \"So it's not going to get to the point of a temperament question because the people will be behind Mr. Trump.\"\nTrump is hardly alone in getting high on himself: Self-confidence is synonymous with politics.\nBut presidential candidates typically take pains to mask their personal ambition in a flurry of detailed policy positions and ostentatious attempts to feel the voters' pain. \nEx-employees on Trump University: 'A fraudulent scheme' and 'a total lie'\nPeter Feaver, a former aide to President George W. Bush, said Trump's reliance on his personality is unique.\n\"This persona is actually one he has been honing for decades,\" said Feaver, a former senior National Security Council official, noting that unlike other big personalities that took aim at the presidency, Trump lacked core ideological convictions.\n\"Take Ronald Reagan for instance. He clearly had a persona that was built up over decades but even more he had a governing philosophy even as he was developing a persona,\" Fever said. \"Trump doesn't have that. He just has the persona.\"\nFeaver also notes the irony that after spending eight years lambasting President Barack Obama as a hubristic, self-obsessed figure, Republicans are about to nominate someone who takes those perceived deficiencies to extremes.\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is not known for introspection. But he seems to agree with critics who say the campaign is almost exclusively about himself.\n\"A very good musician said Trump is the greatest in the world without a guitar, meaning without an instrument. I've got to stand up here by myself,\" Trump said in California last week, explaining his unique style of political performance art.\nHe want on to boast how a good friend -- who was \"by the way, one of the most successful people in the country, in the world\" -- asked him how he was able to hold such large audiences in the palm of his hand.\n\"I said, 'You know, honestly, it's not hard because there's so much love in the room. It's unbelievable.'\"\nSuch comments, laced throughout Trump's public appearances, reveal a politician apparently intoxicated with his own magnetism and brimming with self belief.\nContrasting with conventional nominees\nAnd they contrast with the stump speeches of more conventional political nominees -- which sag with policies designed to lure various constituencies of a party and cliched invocations to a higher national purpose and political unity that Trump's speeches conspicuously lack.\nHis public appearances, while hitting top political points on illegal immigration, free trade and U.S. allies who he says are fleecing America, are effectively a list of his personal triumphs -- that seem like the obsessions of a billionaire and have little in common with his heartland audiences.\nHe frequently relates the tale of his new hotel in Washington in the city's old Post Office building which he says will come in under budget and ahead of schedule and will be \"a higher-quality hotel than anybody ever saw before.\" And he often recalls the media frenzy as he and his wife Melania descended the escalator at Trump tower to launch his campaign last year, saying it \"looked, literally, like the Academy Awards.\"\nWhen Trump hits back, he hits back hard\nTrump's implicit case is that his personality is so dominant, his presence alone makes the need for detailed policy proposals moot. That's why when he vows to rescue health care for veterans, he doesn't say how he will get it done. He promises to bring back jobs from Mexico and China -- again without revealing his approach. He says he will \"knock the hell out of ISIS\" but doesn't detail a credible military strategy. \nGiven the billionaire's somewhat ill defined political creed and unpredictable style, no one can say for sure what his presidency would be like.\nBut if the campaign is anything to go by, one thing is certain: it would be all about Trump.", "UCLA mourns a day after murder-suicide on campus": "A woman found dead on Thursday in Brooklyn Park, a suburb of Minneapolis, was Ashley Hasti, CNN affiliate WCCO reported.\nHasti was Sarkar's wife, officials in Hennepin County, Minnesota, said. Those officials did not confirm Hasti was the woman found dead. \nHasti and Sarkar married June 14, 2011, Hennepin County Communications Officer Carolyn Marinan said. It was unclear if they were still married at the time of their deaths.\nPolice who searched Sarkar's Minnesota home found a note with an ominous title, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters.\n\"Kill list,\" it said, spelling out the names of three people, according to Beck.\nOne of them was William S. Klug, the UCLA professor Sarkar killed.\nA woman's name, apparently Hasti, also was on the list. She had a gunshot wound and had apparently been killed before the UCLA shooting, Deputy Police Chief Mark Bruley told reporters.\nThe third person Sarkar intended to target was another professor at UCLA, Beck said. That faculty member was off-campus Wednesday and was unharmed, the police chief said.\nBeck earlier told \nCNN affiliate KTLA-TV\n that \"a dispute over intellectual property\" was tied to the UCLA shooting, which put the campus on lockdown for hours Wednesday.\n\"Everybody tries to look for a reason for this. Well, first of all, there is no good reason for this,\" Beck told the station. \"This is a mental issue, mental derangement, but it was tied to a dispute over intellectual property.\"\nSarkar felt the professor he killed had released information \"that harmed him,\" he told KTLA. \"UCLA says this is absolutely not true. This is the workings of his imagination.\"\nPolice searching for vehicle\nIt had been several years since Sarkar was a student at UCLA. He graduated in 2013 with a Ph.D. in engineering.\nAt some point in the past few days, Beck said, Sarkar drove from his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Los Angeles, armed with two semiautomatic pistols and multiple rounds of ammunition.\nHe went to his former professor's fourth-floor office Wednesday and shot him dead with multiple rounds, then killed himself, Beck said. \nInvestigators who rushed to the scene found a note, according to the police chief.\n\"The note at UCLA said to ask for the finder to check on his cat in Minnesota. So we checked in (on) his cat in Minnesota at his residence. Actually we did a search warrant at his residence,\" Beck told KTLA.\nThat's where investigators found the kill list, Beck said.\nPolice are searching for the gray 2003 Nissan Sentra Sarkar drove from Minnesota to California, Beck said. \nInside, the police chief told KTLA, \"there will be evidence that will help us unravel this.\"\nAuthorities don't have any evidence suggesting that Sarkar committed additional crimes on his way from Minnesota to California, Beck said. But that's something the police chief says they're investigating.\n\"Of course, that is one of the reasons we want to find the car,\" Beck said, \"to see where that will lead us.\"\n'Our entire UCLA family is mourning'\nSarkar was listed on a\n website for Klug's research group\n at UCLA, and an \nonline abstract\n of his dissertation listed Klug as his adviser.\nKlug's wife, Mary Elise Klug, issued a statement on Thursday thanking the public for its support and requesting privacy.\n\"During this extremely difficult time for our family, we are grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support. This is an indescribable loss. Bill was so much more than my soulmate. I will miss him every day for the rest of my life. Knowing that so many others share our family's sorrow has provided a measure of comfort,\" she said.\n\"That said, we are a very private family, and we need time to heal and recover from this senseless tragedy. At this time, we ask the media to please respect our family's privacy in and around our home, school and local community during the days and weeks ahead, especially for the sake of my children.\"\nUCLA Chancellor Gene Block described the mechanical and aerospace engineering professor as \"a respected, dedicated and caring faculty member\" in a statement Thursday.\n\"Our entire UCLA family is mourning,\" he said.\nFriends described the professor as an easygoing Little League coach. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom called him an \"an empathetic, brilliant teacher.\"\nA friend of Klug's fought back tears as he described the father of two to \nCNN affiliate KCBS-TV\n.\n\"It's hard to even fathom,\" Lance Giroux said. \"To have your son grow up without a dad, it's rough.\" \nThe professor was a proud coach of his young son's baseball team, friends told KCBS.\n\"(He was) always very positive. Kids loved working with him because he was such an easy coach to work with,\" Giroux said. \nKlug's research group focused on theoretical and computation biomechanics, according to the university.\nHe received his undergraduate degree at Westmont College, then obtained a master's degree at UCLA and a Ph.D. from Caltech. \nHe joined UCLA's faculty in July 2003.\n\"Though the path to healing is long, we will make the journey together,\" Block said Thursday in his message to the campus. \"Let us remember and be grateful for the wonderful gifts and talents professor Klug shared with us.\"\nThe shooting\nLos Angeles police said it got a call about the shooting around 10 a.m. PT Wednesday. \nOfficials put the campus on lockdown as authorities investigated. Throngs of police with long guns patrolled the streets of the campus of more than 40,000 students. \nSWAT officers and dozens of squad cars filled the area as police tried to clear campus buildings floor by floor -- a task that CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes called \"monumental.\" \nUCLA's engineering building is in the middle of a densely populated part of Los Angeles. \nThe situation was contained shortly after noon, the police chief said. He said the shooting took place in a small office in the engineering building. \nIt was a jarring, tense time for the university's students. To protect themselves,\n some blocked doors with printers\n, according to a picture on Twitter.\nFreshman Teddi Mattox said she was in a cafeteria getting breakfast along with about 100 other students when the shooting occurred. \n\"We got the alert and a woman said, 'This is not a joke, everyone get to the back of the dining hall because we have to stay away from the windows,' \" she said. \nUCLA officials said they will review all campus safety procedures. \n\"We're pleased in the way notification went out, troubled by some reports of unlocked doors, but we want to review everything,\" said Scott Waugh, UCLA's executive vice chancellor and provost. \nUCLA also extended counseling services over the next few days for students who may be in need, Waugh said. \nFinal exams are scheduled for next week, with graduation set for June 10. \nThe engineering school's senior class dinner \nwas scheduled for Thursday night\n. \nClasses resumed for most of the university Thursday. At the engineering school, where the shooting occurred, classes will resume Monday, officials said.", "Clinton and Sanders battle for California": "The former secretary of state begins a five-day swing through California on Thursday that she hopes will result in a victory that convinces Sanders and his supporters that it's time to unite against Donald Trump. \nBut Sanders shows no signs of going away. The Vermont senator, who has used a bus to traverse the state, headlined over 27 rallies and forums last month, and is expected to have a jam packed schedule the week before Tuesday's primary.\nClinton had planned to campaign this week in New Jersey ahead of that state's Tuesday primary, but the campaign decided instead to fly to San Diego for a speech on foreign policy that will also go directly after Trump, as well as tout her own experience as secretary of state. \nFirst he fought in Iraq, now he could battle Trump, Clinton\nClinton will argue that the choice in 2016 \"goes beyond partisanship\" because Trump is \"unlike any presidential nominee we've seen in modern times and he is fundamentally unfit for the job,\" Jake Sullivan, Clinton's senior policy adviser, said in a statement.\nThe speech shows the predicament Clinton is currently in: She is committing five days to battle Sanders in California, a solidly Democratic general election state, while also trying to focus on the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\"I wonder why Secretary Clinton and her husband Bill are back in California,\" Sanders sarcastically told reporters Wednesday in Spreckels, California. \"I thought we had lost it. It was all over but I guess Secretary Clinton maybe is looking at some polling would suggest otherwise.\"\nDonald Trump's obsession with himself\nThe non-stop campaigning -- coupled with a small ad buy, dozens of surrogate events and targeted get out the vote efforts -- is more than Clinton's senior aides expected to commit to California months ago.\nAides acknowledge Clinton could lose the state, despite polls showing her up narrowly. Internal polling has Clinton up double digits in New Jersey, aides said, and their thinking is that it \"doesn't make sense\" to be in the Garden State while the race in California is still \"tight.\"\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll released Wednesday found the race \nneck-and-neck\n, with Clinton holding a 2 point lead over Sanders, 49% to 47%.\n\"Clearly California is a big state and I am going to do everything I can to meet as many voters as possible,\" Clinton told CNN on Tuesday. \"I was proud today to be endorsed by Gov. Jerry Brown and we are going to keep working as diligently and tirelessly as we can to get as much voters to turn out and vote for me next Tuesday.\"\nBrown, the Democratic governor, endorsed Clinton this week\n, arguing she has the best chance to beat Trump in the fall. Sanders replied that Brown, who challenged Bill Clinton for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination, is part of the establishment backing the front-runner. \n\"I will tell you that in every state that we have gone into, we have taken on the entire Democratic establishment,\" Sanders said in response to a question about Brown's endorsement. \"It's not surprising to me that, you know, we will have the Democratic establishment supporting Hillary Clinton.\"\nSanders fights superdelegate system\nAt the same time, the former secretary of state doesn't need to win California \u2014 or even come that close \u2014 to win the nomination on Tuesday. \nClinton currently needs 70 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination, according to CNN's estimate, a number she is likely to win from the New Jersey primary. Because results from New Jersey will come in hours before California, top aides assume that most news networks will call the Democratic Primary on Tuesday before results come in from the West Coast. And since delegates are awarded proportionally \u2014 this isn't winner-take-all as some of the big GOP contests were -- a Sanders win in California wouldn't make a much of a dent in her lead.\nTrump unleashes on Clinton after day of attacks\nBut Clinton aides said they were aware that losing California to Sanders would be embarrassing for her campaign and could hand the Vermont senator the needed momentum to justify staying in the race through Democratic convention in July.\nSanders has continued to rail on the superdelegate system throughout California, blasting the \"Democratic establishment\" for allowing Democratic elected officials and party insiders to have a vote in who the party nominates.\n\"It is a pretty dumb system,\" Sanders said in Monterey, California on Tuesday about the fact so many party insiders are behind Clinton. \"It's an unfair system, it's a dumb system, and it's a system we will change.\"\nBut Sanders, with a win in California, hopes he will be able to turn the system to his advantage. Sanders and his aides have argued for weeks that a win in California will help the Vermont senator convince super delegates currently backing Clinton to support him instead.\nSo far, though, the effort has been largely fruitless: Clinton has maintained a sizeable superdelegate lead and Sanders has only been able to flip one delegate.\nClinton IT staffer intends to take the Fifth in upcoming deposition\nIn an attempt to lower the stakes in California, the Clinton campaign has instructed surrogates to say that they \"expect\" California to be a close contest, but to downplay its importance in picking the eventual nominee.\n\"Even if Senator Sanders wins each of the remaining contests by 32 points, Hillary Clinton will still have earned the majority of pledged delegates and popular vote,\" read talking points distributed to supporters on Tuesday.\nClinton will continue to largely ignore Sanders in California, aides said, a tactic Clinton employed in late May during a string of events in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.\nClinton, instead, will focus almost exclusively on Trump, casting him as a \"fraud,\" as she did in New Jersey on Wednesday. After \nworkshopping different ways to take on Trump\n, Clinton and her aides have landed on trying to discredit him early as a businessman who only protects his own interests, a man who is incapable of working with others and a candidate who would pose a risk to national security.\nHer speech Thursday will begin drawing from her record as secretary of state, defending what some Republicans have said will be a liability for her in a race against Trump.\nHillary Clinton has $42 million in the bank, campaign raised $27 million in May\n\"She will reflect on her experience making the tough calls and doing the hard work of protecting our country,\" Sullivan said. \"She'll reaffirm her conviction that strong, principled American leadership makes both the United States and the world more secure.\"\nSullivan added: \"And you will hear in her speech a confidence in America and our capacity to overcome the challenges we face while staying true to our values -- a strong contrast to Donald Trump's incessant trash-talking of America.\"\nSanders, however, is expected to continue to draw contrast with Clinton as primary day in California gets closer. He spent Wednesday hitting Clinton for opposing an outright ban on hydraulic fracturing, a controversial drilling tactic.\n\"Sec. Clinton does not support a ban on fracking,\" Sanders tweeted on Wednesday. \"Instead, she would simply impose a few more regulations on it. Not good enough.\"\n ", "Angelina Jolie, before she was famous": "Angelina Jolie was a 15-year-old aspiring actress when she had a photo shoot with Harry Langdon in Los Angeles.", "The Dalai Lama begins his exile": "In 1959, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet and made India his residence-in-exile.

But according to a charging document provided by the Bronx District Attorney's office, he was arraigned Tuesday on two counts of assault, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.\nDiallo, 61, was released without bail, according to Patrice M. O'Shaughnessy in the Bronx DA's office. He left the Bronx criminal courthouse Tuesday evening to cheers from a crowd of supporters, \naccording to CNN affiliate WCBS\n.\nA grand jury will convene to determine whether there is enough evidence to indict Diallo, O'Shaughnessy said.\nDiallo returns to court June 27,  according to the district attorney's office. He will be asked if he wants to testify before a grand jury. \nDiallo told police he received a frantic phone call Monday night from his wife, saying a man was inside their Bronx apartment and was attempting to rape her.\nNenegale Diallo, 51, told investigators she was home with her cousin when she heard a knock on the door. When she opened it, a man forced his way inside, exposed himself and attempted to remove her clothing, she said. \nThe cousin came to her aide and attempted to help fight off the assault, according to a law enforcement source. The wife was able to break free of the suspect and used a cell phone to call her husband. \nMamadou Diallo raced home, took the elevator to the sixth floor and found Earl Nash, 43, in the hallway. Police say Diallo then attacked Nash and beat him severely.\nWhen police arrived, Nash was unresponsive and had suffered severe trauma to his head and body.

The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.\nKirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it. \nThe deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.  \nAfter it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.\nEarlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a \"narrative\" that they did not take place. \nWhen James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. \nKirby, who originally called the deletion a \"glitch,\" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. \n\"They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,\" Kirby said. \nAnother senior State Department official said the technician found the request \"unusual\" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone \"from a certain level and credibility\" in the Department of Public Affairs.\n\"Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,\" this official said. \"Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it.\" \nPsaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: \"I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept.\"\nKirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department.\nHe said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed.\n\"To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,\" he said. \"Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability.\"\nBecause such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found \"no reason\" to press forward with a more formal investigation. ", "Is Dulles guard a war criminal?": "A CNN investigation found that Yusuf Abdi Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities while he was a military commander during Somalia's brutal civil war, has been living a quiet life near the nation's capital for about 20 years. \nHe is just one of more than 1,000 accused war criminals living and working in the United States.\nMass graves and haunting stories\nIn a shallow pit in northern Somalia, forensic anthropologists have been delicately digging around battered bones that were recently found in numerous mass graves. They're the remains of a clan slaughtered during the war in the 1980s, alleged evidence of the brutality carried out by the government regime in power at the time. \nLed by Mohamed Siad Barre, the regime took over Somalia after a coup in 1969 and ruled with an iron fist. In the north, the dominant Isaaq clan was heavily repressed and brutalized by government forces, according to human rights experts. \nYusuf Abdi Ali served as a commander in the Barre regime and is accused of terrorizing the Isaaq people, torturing clan members, burning villages and conducting mass executions.\nSeveral villagers described these atrocities in a documentary that aired on the Canadian network CBC in 1992. One witness claimed Ali captured and killed a family member.\n\"He tied (my brother) to military vehicle and dragged him behind. He said to us if you've got enough power, get him back,\" the villager said. \"He shredded him into pieces. That's how he died.\"\nCNN found that, today, Ali is living a normal suburban life just outside of the nation's capital, in Alexandria, VA. He shares an apartment with his wife and works as a security guard at Dulles, one of the busiest airports in the country.\nAs a result of CNN's investigation, Ali has been placed on administrative leave. \nAli's employer Master Security has a contract with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to provide unarmed security services. Ali passed a \"full, federally mandated vetting process\" that included an FBI background check and a TSA assessment. \nHowever, when CNN initially asked Master Security about Ali, the company said it was \"unaware of the pending litigation.\"\nIn light of the \"very serious nature of the allegations,\" Ali is on administrative leave, and the company is reviewing the case, according to Chief Executive Rick Cucina. Ali's airport access has also been withdrawn.\nThe case against Ali\nAli is being sued in a U.S. civil court. The lawsuit, which a human rights group initially filed in 2006, calls Ali a \"war criminal\" who committed \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\"He oversaw some of the most incredible violence that you can imagine,\" said Kathy Roberts, an attorney for the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), which is leading the civil suit. \"He tortured people personally; he oversaw torture.\" \nThe case has had numerous twists and appeals over the years. The most recent happened in February, when the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only part of the case can move forward -- the lawsuit's claims that Ali tortured and attempted to murder the plaintiff. The other part of the suit -- claims that he committed \"war crimes\" -- cannot because those alleged crimes happened outside of the United States. \nThe lawsuit is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court agrees to hear it, it could become a landmark case over whether foreigners living in the U.S. can be held accountable for crimes allegedly committed overseas.\nRoberts claims Ali is directly responsible for these atrocities, painting disturbing images of acts he allegedly committed. \n\"He arrested people, stole their stuff, burned villages, executed masses of people,\" Roberts said. \"At one point he had a school come out to view an execution.\"\nAli and his lawyer, Joseph Peter Drennan, deny all accusations listed in the CJA lawsuit. \nWhen CNN approached Ali outside his apartment in Alexandria, he declined an interview, telling correspondent Kyra Phillips: \"To tell you the truth, all is false. Baseless.\"\n\"How dare anyone call him a war criminal,\" Drennan told CNN. \"Those are just allegations. If he is indeed a war criminal, take him to The Hague. Or if he is a war criminal, take it up with the immigration authorities. Don't sue him in an American court... My client deserves to live in the U.S. just as any other legal permanent resident.\"\nHowever, there is no criminal court in the world that can try Ali for war crimes. One key reason for this is that no criminal court really has jurisdiction to do so.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague wasn't formally envisioned until 1994, following the genocide in Rwanda. The ICC didn't issue its first arrest warrants until a decade later. \nOther special war crimes or genocide tribunals, such as those in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Cambodia, were only created for the specific areas where those crimes took place. Somalia has never been able to develop a complete justice system that could embark on such a tribunal.\nThe U.S. doesn't have jurisdiction over the events that played out in Somalia in the 1980s, even though Ali has ties to the U.S. military. At the time, the Siad Barre government was a U.S. ally. Thus, American officials considered many military soldiers and commanders, including Ali, to be fighting for U.S. interests. \nDrennan asks: If the Defense Department had no problem with Ali, why should anyone else? \n\"My client has never been adjudicated to have committed any wrongful acts of any sort, much less be correctly seen as a war criminal,\" Drennan said. \"He is not a war criminal.\"\nThe U.S. government says its investigators have been aware of Ali for years, \"based upon allegations that he had been involved in human rights violations.\" \nHowever, officials refused to provide further details.\nThe suspected war criminals among us\nAli is just one of many people who are living in the United States despite being accused of committing some of the worst violence in modern times.\nThese people -- most of whom are men -- are accused of crimes such as mass murder in El Salvador; torture and murder in Chile; ethnic cleansing in Somalia. Some are even wanted in their homelands, with outstanding extradition requests to remove them from the U.S. so they can be held accountable for their crimes.\nYet they continue to lead typical American lives, with some even working jobs in high-profile positions.\n\"There's about 1,000 suspected perpetrators in the United States,\" Roberts said.\nRoberts and CJA say Americans should know that accused war criminals and suspected human rights violators are living across the country.\n\"It fundamentally violates what we could call American values,\" Roberts said. \"But I really would rather say human values -- to allow people like this to get off scot-free, and to allow them to benefit from the rule of law that they deprived their victims of, and they need to be held accountable.\"\nAli ended up in Canada after the Barre military regime collapsed in 1991. But he was deported several years later after news about his alleged war crimes in Somalia became public through the CBC documentary. \nAli entered the U.S. on a visa through his Somali wife, Intisar Farah, who became a U.S. citizen. In 2006, she was found guilty of naturalization fraud for claiming she was a refugee from the very Somali clan that Ali is accused of torturing.\nFrom Somalia to Dulles \nDrennan said there should be no concerns whatsoever that Ali was working at an airport.

Those officials did not confirm Hasti was the woman found dead. \nHasti and Sarkar married June 14, 2011, Hennepin County Communications Officer Carolyn Marinan said. It was unclear if they were still married at the time of their deaths.\nPolice who searched Sarkar's Minnesota home found a note with an ominous title, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters.\n\"Kill list,\" it said, spelling out the names of three people, according to Beck.\nOne of them was William S. Klug, the UCLA professor Sarkar killed.\nA woman's name, apparently Hasti, also was on the list. She had a gunshot wound and had apparently been killed before the UCLA shooting, Deputy Police Chief Mark Bruley told reporters.\nThe third person Sarkar intended to target was another professor at UCLA, Beck said. That faculty member was off-campus Wednesday and was unharmed, the police chief said.\nBeck earlier told \nCNN affiliate KTLA-TV\n that \"a dispute over intellectual property\" was tied to the UCLA shooting, which put the campus on lockdown for hours Wednesday.\n\"Everybody tries to look for a reason for this. Well, first of all, there is no good reason for this,\" Beck told the station. \"This is a mental issue, mental derangement, but it was tied to a dispute over intellectual property.\"\nSarkar felt the professor he killed had released information \"that harmed him,\" he told KTLA. \"UCLA says this is absolutely not true. This is the workings of his imagination.\"\nPolice searching for vehicle\nIt had been several years since Sarkar was a student at UCLA. He graduated in 2013 with a Ph.D. in engineering.\nAt some point in the past few days, Beck said, Sarkar drove from his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Los Angeles, armed with two semiautomatic pistols and multiple rounds of ammunition.\nHe went to his former professor's fourth-floor office Wednesday and shot him dead with multiple rounds, then killed himself, Beck said. \nInvestigators who rushed to the scene found a note, according to the police chief.\n\"The note at UCLA said to ask for the finder to check on his cat in Minnesota. So we checked in (on) his cat in Minnesota at his residence. Actually we did a search warrant at his residence,\" Beck told KTLA.\nThat's where investigators found the kill list, Beck said.\nPolice are searching for the gray 2003 Nissan Sentra Sarkar drove from Minnesota to California, Beck said. \nInside, the police chief told KTLA, \"there will be evidence that will help us unravel this.\"\nAuthorities don't have any evidence suggesting that Sarkar committed additional crimes on his way from Minnesota to California, Beck said. But that's something the police chief says they're investigating.\n\"Of course, that is one of the reasons we want to find the car,\" Beck said, \"to see where that will lead us.\"\n'Our entire UCLA family is mourning'\nSarkar was listed on a\n website for Klug's research group\n at UCLA, and an \nonline abstract\n of his dissertation listed Klug as his adviser.\nKlug's wife, Mary Elise Klug, issued a statement on Thursday thanking the public for its support and requesting privacy.\n\"During this extremely difficult time for our family, we are grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support. This is an indescribable loss. Bill was so much more than my soulmate. I will miss him every day for the rest of my life. Knowing that so many others share our family's sorrow has provided a measure of comfort,\" she said.\n\"That said, we are a very private family, and we need time to heal and recover from this senseless tragedy. At this time, we ask the media to please respect our family's privacy in and around our home, school and local community during the days and weeks ahead, especially for the sake of my children.\"\nUCLA Chancellor Gene Block described the mechanical and aerospace engineering professor as \"a respected, dedicated and caring faculty member\" in a statement Thursday.\n\"Our entire UCLA family is mourning,\" he said.\nFriends described the professor as an easygoing Little League coach. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom called him an \"an empathetic, brilliant teacher.\"\nA friend of Klug's fought back tears as he described the father of two to \nCNN affiliate KCBS-TV\n.\n\"It's hard to even fathom,\" Lance Giroux said. \"To have your son grow up without a dad, it's rough.\" \nThe professor was a proud coach of his young son's baseball team, friends told KCBS.\n\"(He was) always very positive. Kids loved working with him because he was such an easy coach to work with,\" Giroux said. \nKlug's research group focused on theoretical and computation biomechanics, according to the university.\nHe received his undergraduate degree at Westmont College, then obtained a master's degree at UCLA and a Ph.D. from Caltech. \nHe joined UCLA's faculty in July 2003.\n\"Though the path to healing is long, we will make the journey together,\" Block said Thursday in his message to the campus. \"Let us remember and be grateful for the wonderful gifts and talents professor Klug shared with us.\"\nThe shooting\nLos Angeles police said it got a call about the shooting around 10 a.m. PT Wednesday. \nOfficials put the campus on lockdown as authorities investigated. Throngs of police with long guns patrolled the streets of the campus of more than 40,000 students. \nSWAT officers and dozens of squad cars filled the area as police tried to clear campus buildings floor by floor -- a task that CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes called \"monumental.\" \nUCLA's engineering building is in the middle of a densely populated part of Los Angeles. \nThe situation was contained shortly after noon, the police chief said. He said the shooting took place in a small office in the engineering building. \nIt was a jarring, tense time for the university's students. To protect themselves,\n some blocked doors with printers\n, according to a picture on Twitter.\nFreshman Teddi Mattox said she was in a cafeteria getting breakfast along with about 100 other students when the shooting occurred. \n\"We got the alert and a woman said, 'This is not a joke, everyone get to the back of the dining hall because we have to stay away from the windows,' \" she said. \nUCLA officials said they will review all campus safety procedures. \n\"We're pleased in the way notification went out, troubled by some reports of unlocked doors, but we want to review everything,\" said Scott Waugh, UCLA's executive vice chancellor and provost. \nUCLA also extended counseling services over the next few days for students who may be in need, Waugh said. \nFinal exams are scheduled for next week, with graduation set for June 10. \nThe engineering school's senior class dinner \nwas scheduled for Thursday night\n. \nClasses resumed for most of the university Thursday.

Or if he wants to.\nAfter the final wave of states vote next Tuesday, Sanders has one decision to make. His supporters have another. And many insist they will not fall into line behind Hillary Clinton.\n\"You can't expose the corruption of the political system and then expect us to get behind that same political system,\" said Gary Frazier, a leader of a group called Black Men for Bernie, who is also organizing Sanders supporters here in Philadelphia.\nIn interviews here this week, Frazier and Taylor outlined their plans to CNN, imploring Sanders' supporters to leave the Democratic Party to protest rules governing the presidential nominating system. They are taking seriously Sanders' call for a political revolution, complicating any hope for quick unity with Clinton.\n\"We are prepared to de-register from the Democratic Party and explore other options. Maybe we don't get it done in this election, but I can damn well guarantee you this: We mean business,\" Frazier said. \"If Bernie Sanders does not walk out of that thing as the nominee, we can guarantee you from that point on we'll start the de-registration of the Democratic Party. They have a choice to make.\"\nTheir passion doesn't change the hard reality of the delegate math: Clinton will clinch the party's nomination next Tuesday. Sanders will not.\nYet Sanders' most loyal supporters are now convinced the system is rigged, setting up a collision course for Democrats. He has done little to dissuade them.\n\"It's an unfair system, it's a dumb system, and it's a system we will change,\" Sanders said in California, rallying supporters through comments that have fueled deep skepticism about party rules.\nThe support for Sanders is not built on the party faithful alone.\nCNN exit polls from 27 states that have voted this year show that 63% of Sanders' supporters are Democrats and 33% are independents or from another party. It's a far cry from Clinton, whose supporters are 85% Democrat and only 13% independent or from another party.\nClinton needs some of those independents to win, which is why winning over those Sanders supporters is critical to her campaign.\n\"He said the other day he'll do everything possible to defeat Donald Trump,\" Clinton told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. \"I take him at his word. The threat he poses the country and democracy and economy, I certainly expect Senator Sanders to do what he said he would.\"\nThe Clinton campaign is also counting on Trump to serve as a unifying force to the party, which is a miscalculation in the minds of Taylor and Frazier.\n\"If we don't go along with Hillary, then Trump's going to get the presidency and the world's going to be in shambles,\" Frazier said. \"That's 'BS' to us.\"\nA Quinnipiac poll Wednesday found that 75% of Sanders supporters said they would rally behind Clinton in a race with Trump, but about a quarter of his supporters went elsewhere. It's an open question whether the campaign's heat of the moment will fade or give way to party unity.\nSara Alicia Huerta Long, who traveled to New Jersey from Michigan to volunteer for the Sanders campaign, said she believed the \"Bernie or Bust\" movement had considerable support and Clinton would struggle to win over Sanders' supporters.\n\"There's a lot of first time voters who've only come out to vote for him,\" Long said in an interview, \"and they don't want her.\"", "San Francisco cops rescue stranded, shivering baby sea lion": "Officers with the San Francisco police department found a sea lion pup wandering around by itself near a stairwell in the Ocean Beach neighborhood.

The first baby was \nborn in Hawaii\n. \nDoctors first examined the mother when she came to the medical center Friday. Ultrasound screening revealed the baby had \"significant microcephaly,\" he said. Babies with microcephaly have small brains and heads. \nThe baby also had calcification and dilated ventricles in the brain, according to Al-Khan. \nTests were done to rule out other causes of these abnormalities. \n\"When I saw her today, I was pretty much convinced \nthis was a Zika-affected baby,\n\" he said. \nCDC confirmation\nThe mother, who has relatives in New Jersey, traveled to the United States from Honduras in hopes of receiving better medical care because she knew her baby may have Zika-related problems, according to Al-Khan.\nDoctors believe she was infected during the second trimester of her pregnancy. She experienced a fever and rash, both symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease, which is known to cause the devastating birth defect microcephaly and other neurological disorders.\n \"When she developed the symptoms, she was seen by an OBGYN who suspected the baby was growth restricted,\" he said. \nDoctors there coordinated with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test the woman for the Zika virus. \nThe samples were sent to the CDC and results confirming the diagnosis of the virus came back Tuesday, according to Al-Khan. However, he said, that was not a factor in the mother undergoing a cesarean section to deliver.  \nClose to due date\nThe mother was close to full-term in her pregnancy. \n\"There were a few reasons the baby needed to be delivered today, including low amniotic fluid,\" he said.\n Al-Khan said such babies have \"tremendous neurological problems,\" and most don't do well.  \nThere are more than 300 pregnant women with the virus in the United States and its territories who are being followed as part of \na national registry\n.\nInformation on the outcomes or stages of these pregnancies has not been released.

John Clifton had warned the audience the images might be disturbing. \nThe group had gathered for a \nCivilian Response to Active Shooter Events\n training held at Perimeter Church in the Atlanta suburb, one of several such events increasingly being held around the country. Jackson, Mississippi; Durham, New Hampshire; Greenfield, Indiana; Pampa, Texas; and Orem, Utah, are among the dozens of cities that have staged training sessions of late, and more seem to be popping up every week. \nBeverlee Athens, 45, and her husband, John, 59, drove from nearby Alpharetta to attend the Johns Creek event. Katie, 2, bounced on her mother's lap, oblivious that she was a primary reason her parents were at the church that night. \n\"I'm not going to sit back and be a victim,\" Beverlee Athens said. \nJohn Athens, a retired firefighter and emergency medical services instructor who's in charge of security at his own church, said he and his wife have concealed-carry permits and \"believe in protection,\" but the state of the world has him even more vigilant. \n\"I just know that we've got to be prepared. ... It's the day we live in now, unfortunately, and we've got her to think about,\" he said, nodding to his restless, smiling daughter. \n'They do it for fame'\nThe idea behind CRASE is that the shooters at \nColumbine\n, at \nVirginia Tech\n, at \nFort Hood\n, at \nSandy Hook\n, in \nSan Bernandino\n and in scores of other horrific events across the country since the late 1990s aren't like muggers. They don't want your wallet or purse. \nThey want a body count, blood and headlines.\n\"They're simply monsters. They do it for fame. They do it for notoriety,\" Clifton told the crowd. \nU.S. gun violence in graphs, charts\nClifton went on to explain the directives of the CRASE training: avoid, deny, defend -- similar to the instructions given to employees January 26 when some kind of shooting event was reported at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. It \nlater turned out to be a false alarm\n.\n\"Avoid\" means more than run. It's about knowing where the exits are and visualizing how you'll get out of a violent situation before one unfolds. Don't live in fear, but be vigilant, Clifton explained. \n\"Deny\" means taking away a shooter's chance to kill you, whether it's by barricading a door, turning out lights, silencing your phone or hiding, preferably behind something that will stop a bullet. \nThen there's \"defend,\" and that's where things get tricky, because essentially it means fight. And with a few exceptions, a mass shooter's targets aren't soldiers or others who might be trained to fight. They're regular people: students, coworkers, moviegoers and the like. \n\"Do not fight fairly. THIS IS ABOUT SURVIVAL,\" a handout given to Johns Creek attendees said. \nChange in tactics\nPete Blair, executive director for \nAdvanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University\n, which teaches police how to respond to active shooters, says Columbine sounded a \"wake-up call.\"\nAround 2002, realizing the model used by law enforcement officers who responded to the shootings at Columbine was not effective, schools began requesting \"avoid, deny, defend\" training. CRASE didn't become formalized until 2013, hence the uptick in training sessions across the nation, he said. \nMother of Columbine killer speaks\nMore than 85,000 law enforcement officers have been trained in \nALERRT operations\n, and about 5,100 have been trained to be CRASE instructors. \nBlair is a self-professed \"data-driven guy,\" and there are a couple of statistics regarding active shootings that struck him: The first is that in one out of five incidents, it's the potential victims who stop the shooters; the second is that more than half of active shooter events are over before police arrive, which, on average, takes three minutes. \n\"That's a long time for someone to shoot at people,\" he said. \"It takes some time for the SWAT team to get there, and during that time, the shooter has free rein to keep murdering people.\"\nJoel Myrick is familiar with fighting an active shooter. A career educator, he was the assistant principal in 1997 at Pearl High School in a Jackson, Mississippi, suburb when a \nshooting occurred at the school\n. The event is considered the first in the almost 20-year rash of mass shootings that continues today.\nOn October 1 of that year, a 16-year-old who had just stabbed and bludgeoned his mother to death drove to the school and killed ex-girlfriend Christina Menefee and classmate Lydia Dew before shooting seven other students, all in the span of a few minutes. Myrick remembers hearing the shots. \n\"Being an old Mississippi boy, I'd deer hunted and I knew immediately he had a deer rifle, a .30-(caliber) deer rifle,\" he said. \nMyrick rushed to his car to retrieve a .45-caliber handgun. When the gunman got into a vehicle, Myrick cut him off at the pass, leveled his weapon and ordered him to stop. The teen swerved off the road and spun out, and the assistant principal was able to \"apprehend him at that particular point till police came,\" he said.\n'Fog of war'\nNow a polymer science instructor at Hancock County Career and Technical Center in Mississippi, Myrick says he can't say for certain he'd do the same thing if a gunman attacked the kids in his charge today. \n\"I feel like I would, but I can't say with certainty,\" he said. \"My DNA, I would try to do the same thing. That's my opinion, but I don't have any way of knowing.\"\nThe reason is because in the \"fog of war,\" as the former National Guardsman of 21 years puts it, no one really knows what they'll do. \nFast facts about rampage killings\nThe CRASE training expands on this notion. Humans are strange, social creatures, Maj. Clifton explained. How one person reacts can dictate how others respond. Humans are also prone to habit, he said. \nWhen the first plane \nhit the World Trade Center\n on 9/11, some people took the time to log off their computers and fetch their purses or briefcases before evacuating. \nWhen a fire engulfed \nThe Station nightclub in Rhode Island\n, where the band Great White was performing in 2003, 100 people died -- \n58 of them\n in the main entryway or just outside it, despite there being three other exits in the club.\n\"If something happens, most of you would exit the door you came in,\" Clifton said, pointing to the entrances in the back of the church auditorium. \nAnother human tendency hampering response in emergency situations is denial, he said. \n\"The brain doesn't want to think something bad is happening,\" he said. \nThat delay can put you in greater danger, especially when you consider that as your stress level spikes, along with your heartbeat, your ability to act rationally can be diminished. Once your heart rate hits 150 beats per minute, tunnel vision and audio exclusion can follow, further exacerbating matters. \nHaunting example\nReaction is key to survival. At a Marietta, Georgia, CRASE training late last year, police officers shared a diagram showing the classrooms of Norris Hall, where most of the deaths occurred during \nthe 2007 Virginia Tech shooting\n. \nAccording to the graphic: The first classroom the shooter reached, Room 206, went into traditional lockdown. When it was all over, 10 of the 14 people inside that classroom were killed, while two were wounded. In Room 211, which also went into lockdown when the shots were heard, 12 of 18 were killed and six were wounded. \nIn the adjacent Rooms 204 and 207, students and faculty barricaded or tried to barricade the doors, while in Room 204, 10 students jumped out of the window. In Room 207, five of 13 were killed and six were wounded, while in 204, two of 19 were killed and three were wounded.\nIn Room 205, where a dozen students and faculty got on the ground and barricaded the door with their feet, preventing the shooter's entry, everyone survived. \n\"Doing nothing doesn't work. Doing something does, and these are the statistics to prove it,\" Sgt. Todd Hood, a SWAT commander, told the crowd in Johns Creek. \"Hide and hope? That's like a wing and a prayer. ... That's very problematic. That's not what we teach.\" \nWhile you're awaiting police, look for weapons and be prepared to improvise, he said. A fire extinguisher can be a fine weapon, and there's power in numbers if a group bumrushed a shooter. \n\"Pens can do damage,\" he said. \"If you poke their eyes out, can they see? Probably not.\"\nMyrick agrees with the approach, and concurs that planning is important. \n\"I don't think anybody knows that they will do when it comes to that particular point,\" he said. \"If you're not trained to defend yourself, you won't defend yourself when the fog of war sets in.\"\nDeadliest mass shootings in U.S. history\nThe CRASE teachings, he pointed out, are more about planning than training. Why not take it a step further? Why not tack some balloons to the wall and let kids see how many they can pop with a math book? Why not let them have a go at swinging a chair, just for muscle-memory's sake? \nMyrick worries that because there's usually no warning when a gunman kicks in a door, \"you've got to have something right at your fingertips that you can do. There's no time to do anything.\"\nHe'd also like to see well-trained, armed security personnel in schools. The United States spent billions on nuclear submarines and never fired a shot, he said. It was a mere deterrent. Why wouldn't we take the same approach to schools, which house \"our most prized possessions as parents\"?\nChances low, but on rise\nTo be clear, your chances of being hurt or killed in a mass shooting remain slim. \nStatistics from 2000 to 2013\n show that you have a slightly better chance of being struck by lightning than dying in a random mass shooting. \nBut the largely 50-and-over audience attending the CRASE training in Johns Creek is not being reactionary when they say the world feels like it's becoming more dangerous. \nFrom 2000 to 2007, the United States saw an average of 7.4 active shooter events per year. The number is 16.4 for 2008 to 2013. \nIs gun violence a mental health issue?\nRobert Adair, 60, an architect from Peachtree Corners, just south of Johns Creek, said he wasn't much of a gun guy until someone he knew was shot and kidnapped. While he agrees with the \"avoid, deny, defend\" philosophy, his primary purpose for attending the CRASE training was to understand his responsibility as a gun owner in an active shooter situation.\n\"I have a carry permit, and basically I want to find out what I should do or should not do if I find myself at a scene before the police arrive,\" he said. \nHood addressed his query during the two-hour session: \"Law enforcement officers seldom tell you to grab a gun, but do it here. If they're bringing violence to you, they don't matter.\" \nBut once police arrive, Hood said, holster the weapon, get your hands up and promptly let police know that you're armed.

During the investigation, Savio's body was exhumed and an autopsy reclassified her death from accidental to homicide.\nPeterson said the evidence showed Savio hit her head on a bathtub. Peterson also maintained his innocence in the murder-for-hire plot.

We were pleased in the way that notifications went out, (and) troubled by some reports of unlocked doors, but we want to review everything and make sure that the campus is as safe as possible,\" UCLA provost Scott Waugh said.\nGoogling how to secure a door\nEven at doors that did lock, some people tied them as an extra measure.\nMiguel Rodriguez and about 120 other students were in an auditorium classroom on the UCLA campus when cellphones started buzzing with news of the emergency. \nRodriguez, a 32-year-old senior majoring in Spanish, said he and others raced to close the doors to the large room. \nThey were stuck open, unable to be closed without an Allen wrench. \nSo Rodriguez and his professor \"made the decision to take our chances.\" \nThey led the group 100 feet down a hallway to a file storage room where they could lock the door. For extra safety, they pushed a table in front of the door. \nDaphne Ying said she was notified of the situation by a Bruin Alert, university messages that are sent to email, text and Twitter accounts. But the reported shooter was on South Campus and she was on North, so she went to class instead of returning home. \nYing and her classmates were in one of those rooms where the door opened out so once they understood the gravity of the situation they began searching on the internet for \"How to lock a swinging door.\"\nSomeone suggested tying a projector cord to the door handle. Then they tied that to a chair that was bolted to the floor. \nAfter 30 minutes, the silhouettes of four officers appeared through a wall made of opaque glass.\n\"They tried to open the door and until we heard them speak we were very scared,\" she told CNN. They never said anything to us though and didn't open the door.\"\nNinety minutes later the students received the all clear message. \nCarrie Rapaport, a 42-year-old senior, said that initially her class was in a room where the door couldn't be locked, so the professor and the teaching assistant led them to a place more secure.\nEven with the door locked, they decided to make it more secure. Rapaport donated her belt as did another student, and a man in their class bound the hinge so it wouldn't open.    \n\"I know we felt better about doing it. It's something that actually does work,\" Rapaport said. \"The hinge won't budge and won't allow you to come in.\" \n'Secure the door'\nThe UCLA website has instructions for people on campus who are caught in an active shooter situation. It says what to do if someone is in a hallway, in an auditorium, in an open space, is confronted by a potential shooter or is in class.\n\"If you are in a classroom, room or office, STAY THERE, secure the door and turn off the lights. Remain silent.\"\nIf the door cannot be locked and opens in, the school says, use heavy furniture or door wedge to barricade the door.\nStudents said there are no drills like the ones they might go through in high school to simulate what to do if a gunman attacks.\nExpert: Change locks on old doors\nOne expert told CNN that it is just not feasible to go through such drills with so many students and personnel.\n\"What we do recommend is that key faculty and staff who would be critical in activating emergency response plans do drills at least annually,\" Amanda Botelho Robbins, a senior security consultant for San Diego-based TSG Solutions, said.\nRobbins said it is common for doors in older buildings, many built before school bloodbaths like the Columbine massacre in 1999 and Virginia Tech shootings in 2007 became a national concern, to be hard to secure from the inside.\nUniversities should change the locks on any door that cannot be locked from the inside, she said. That can cost $200 to $400 per door (more for a cafeteria or auditorium door), but it is worth it, she added.  \n\"We also recommend electronic security systems, especially on exterior doors,\" she said, referring to giving campus police the ability to remotely lock doors into buildings.\nSome universities are beginning to think about access controls for interior doors, too. But that's very expensive, she said.\nEmotional experience\nFreshman Celina Avalos said first-year students are lectured about sexual assault, dangers of alcohol and mental health services. \nAvalos, 19, was in her dorm when the alerts went out and she locked her door, which can be \"double locked\" by turning the handle in a certain manner. \n\"My first instinct was to stay in my dorm, don't open the door to anyone and don't go out anywhere until further notice,\" she said.\nIt took about two hours for the campus to be swept and declared safe by the authorities.\nWaugh, the university provost, said he was happy with the performance of campus police and other emergency responders.\nBut when asked further about the unlockable doors, he repeated his call for a safer campus. \"We will review the locks on the doors, and any security issue that has arisen during the course of today,\" he said.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified a UCLA student who discussed how he and others sought sanctuary after they realized they were in an auditorium with doors stuck open.

It has more than 900 photos, many of them vintage.", "How zoo enclosures are evolving": "It is a mantra that is fundamental to designing exhibits at zoos the world over, where enclosures must be safe environments for both animals and visitors. \nBut how this translates into real-world designs is not always clear cut, as \nthe recent breach at the Cincinnati Zoo attests\n. Zoo officials there shot dead a western lowland gorilla to save a 3-year-old boy who managed to slip into the animal's enclosure Saturday.     \nRob Vernon, spokesman for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which accredits facilities, said the Cincinnati Zoo was \"absolutely\" a respected facility that had produced few issues in its history. \nThe zoo has been accredited without interruption since 1978, most recently in 2014, and earlier this year received an award for maintaining its accreditation for a quarter century, he said. \nDesign evolution\nStandards and zoo design have evolved together, says George Houthoff, CEO and co-owner of Houthoff Zoo Design. \nHe saw his company rebuild the gorilla exhibit at Rotterdam Zoo in the Netherlands after the escape of Bokito, a silverback who wounded four people in 2007. \nHe says that the industry has evolved in leaps and bounds in recent years, but, especially in some countries, there is still a long way to go to ensure complete safety.\n\"Zoos have developed from concrete boxes with steel bars to natural looking habitat immersion environments... (but) worldwide there are still a lot of exhibits in zoos that are potentially dangerous for children.\"\nFormer zookeeper Amanda O'Donoughue, a self-described gorilla lover, \nnoted on Facebook\n that the gravitation to more natural enclosures with seamless views \"is great until little children begin falling into exhibits, which of course can happen to anyone, especially in a crowded zoo-like setting.\" \nZookeepers always kept a welded mesh barrier between themselves and the \"gentle giants\" because the incredibly strong creatures could cause serious harm even when lacking the intent, O'Donoughue said in her post, which has been shared more than 1 million times.\n\"I can't point fingers at anyone in this situation, but we need to really evaluate the safety of the animal enclosures from the visitor side,\" the Tallahassee woman wrote. \"Not impeding that view is a tough one, but there should be no way that someone can find themselves inside of an animal's exhibit.\"\nComplex, stimulating -- and safe\nAnimal welfare needs to go hand in hand with visitor experience and safety, says Patrick Janikowski, principal of PJA Architects. One of the first considerations, he says, is how much space the animals have. \nIf space allows, moats -- like at the gorilla enclosure in Cincinnati -- are used to keep a safe distance between the animals and visitors and give the animals a more \"natural\" environment. If space is more limited, heavy mesh or glass enclosures can give a similar experience. \nThe \ngorilla species survival plan\n, which provides guidelines to 51 zoos, says there is \"no golden rule\" for the size of gorilla enclosures, and as experts learn about optimally housing apes, \"exhibit designs evolve, and hopefully improve over time.\"\n\"Gorillas should be housed in large, complex, environmentally enriched enclosures. Outdoor access should be provided to all gorillas whether on exhibit or off exhibit,\" it says. \"Visual barriers, access to privacy, climbing apparatus, vegetation, nesting material, and manipulable objects are important in reducing stress, social conflict and boredom.\"\nWhat zoo designers, keepers and management are ultimately trying to achieve, Janikowski says, is to give \"optimum space for the animal, optimum viewing for the guest and some type of interaction while keeping everyone safe. \n\"That's really the goal.\"\nChildren: Unpredictable variable\nBut even with complete adherence to standards, accidents happen. \n\"I have four kids. I know what its like to herd cats and try to keep your eye on all of them. It doesn't take long if someone wants to see. That's the thing with little kids... they're down low -- they're always looking around curiously,\" Janikowski says.\n\"That's what (the child who fell into the Cincinnati gorilla enclosure) was doing -- he wanted to see a magnificent animal ... it's hard to blame anyone.\"\nHouthoff agrees that the human factor is an unknown, but the onus still lies with zoos to ensure safety remains paramount.  \nThe basic -- but often ignored -- rules of zoo safety\n\"Kids are kids,\" Houthoff says. \"Of course you have to keep an eye on them (but) I think it's the zoos' responsibility to ensure the safety of their visitors. That means making absolutely sure that exhibits are childproof.\" \n\"What happened in Cincinnati should be a reminder for all zoo staff to keep evaluating the safety of their exhibits, specifically from a small child's perspective.\"\nCincinnati's gorilla enclosure has been inspected in the past, but now it will need to be inspected \"through the lens of a 3-year-old,\" the AZA's Vernon said. While it appears zoo officials handled this incident appropriately, he said, the AZA will likely require modifications to the exhibit. \n\"You don't anticipate something like this happening, or it wouldn't occur,\" Vernon said.", "'The other side of the glass': Portraits in a liquor store": "Lee started taking photos of customers at her parents' liquor store in Washington about 15 years ago. The title of her photo series, \"Plexiglass,\" comes from the fact that the majority of Lee's portraits were made from behind the store's acrylic glass -- a solid, transparent plastic used for security.\n\"It's just kind of interesting,\" Lee said. \"Other people don't really get to see it, experience it -- to be on the other side of the glass.\"\nBy taking portraits of customers from behind the counter, Lee shows that her parents' liquor store encompasses two distinct experiences. Not only are there transactions of commodities taking place, but there are transactions of connections -- and the camera becomes a tool to break down the barrier between the buyer and the seller.\n\"I think when something's there to come between a human connection, it almost makes you more curious in a way,\" Lee said. \"It's almost like if you have a barrier up, it makes you almost want it more, want to know them more. ... I ask (customers) for something so much more than their money. I ask them to be vulnerable for me or to share a piece of them with me. If you're taking a person's portrait, it's asking a lot of somebody.\"\nLee says that what she enjoys most about her customers' portraits is how she is able to see the evolution of people. Her observations place her at the forefront of a range of experiences and emotions. \n\"You see all kinds of stuff. They're very interesting people,\" said Lee, who has helped at her parents' store ever since she was a teenager. \"There are so many customers that I talk to every day when I am working. Just being able to actually have documented it is pretty special, because we forget a lot of things visually.\"\nShe sees the joyful growth of some of the store's visitors. But she also sees the disappearance of others. Kim, pictured in photo No. 3 in the gallery above, was one of Lee's favorite customers.\n\"He was someone that I really connected to because of his personality,\" Lee said. \"I took his picture many times for maybe over five or six years or something. I think that image is closer to me in a lot of ways because he passed away. ... When I see his picture, it has a very special meaning to me.\"\nLee has often gotten in trouble for taking customers' portraits and talking to them at length because they would then end up staying in the store \"forever,\" she says.\n\"The most stressful thing about taking pictures in my parents' liquor store is honestly my mother or my father yelling at me because I'm at work,\" Lee said. \"They just don't really understand it. ... Not because they don't appreciate photography, but because it's so everyday norm for them.\"\nLee's parents are retiring at the end of the month, so she said her photo series is basically complete. Through \"Plexiglass,\" Lee shows that there is an abundance of detail to be discovered in places we take for granted every day. There are people, conversations and moments that we have yet to fully embrace. \n\"It's such a personal body of work to me,\" she said. \"These (customers) have big hearts. They're open people. They're expressive. And that's very difficult to find.\n\"I really care about my customers. ... For them to trust me is something that I'm always grateful for.\"", "How police respond to 'active shooters'": "", "What a shot! 29 amazing sports photos": "Take a look at 29 amazing sports photos from May 24 through May 30."}, "cnn_allpolitics": {"First on CNN: Trump ally forms super PAC with $32M in commitments": "Super PAC officials earlier in the day filed documents with the FEC for a new group, Rebuilding America Now, that Barrack said had attracted tens of millions of dollars in early money. Barrack, who hosted Trump's first major fundraiser, has long been pointed to by donors as an eventual point man for Trump's super PAC operation, which thus far is nascent and has yet to attract large donations. He said he will not have a formal role with the group.\nAbout four donors account for the $32 million, Barrack told CNN. These include new donors who have never donated large amounts of money to the Republican Party before. It took five phone calls to woo the donors, Barrack said, who he declined to identify.\nBarrack said the principal operatives behind the group are Ken McKay and Laurie Gay. McKay, the former campaign manager to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, is currently a senior adviser to Trump's campaign and would be required by election law to \"cool off\" from the campaign before aiding an outside group. \nGay is an ally of Paul Manafort, Trump's chief strategist and one power center in Trump's cadre of aides. The treasurer for the group is Ryan Call, a former chair of the Colorado Republican Party.\n\"These super PACs have meaning, they have purpose, but they have been viewed historically as being not so trustworthy,\" Barrack said on \"OutFront.\" \"So the idea of having a solid, trustworthy -- with no skimming, no float -- that's aligned with the candidate but is not coordinating with the candidate, is key.\"\nMajor donors have skeptically viewed the first two super PACs that have flooded the pro-Trump space, with questions raised about their viability and operational effectiveness. One of the original groups, Great America PAC, is about to begin a series of five kickoff fundraisers, including a multi-day event in Dallas next weekend, according to lead donor Bill Doddridge.\nGreat America PAC was defiant Thursday despite the news of a better-funded rival.\n\"It's not surprising to see the emergence of new super PACs supporting Donald Trump, and some may recruit top level donors like we have already done,\" said Eric Beach, a strategist for the group. \"But the bottom line is we are way ahead of everyone else. Our approach is unique and will be highly effective.\"\nThe close ties between this Trump group and the official campaign could assuage concerns from wealthy donors about where to place their funds. Trump sharply disavowed super PACs during his primary campaign, but his campaign has been largely silent about the independent groups that have begun fundraising for the general election.\nTrump nevertheless is expected to be significantly outspent by Hillary Clinton and her allied groups.\nTrump himself has started traditional fundraising, and Barrack also reflected on the finance event he hosted in Los Angeles on his behalf, which raised a total of $9.5 million -- $3.5 million of which came after the event. Barrack said Trump was at ease before the crowd.\n\"He was amazing. He was funny. He was charming. He was totally indulged in the individuality of the crowd,\" Barrack said. \"He was his real, usual class act.\"", "Trump unleashes on Clinton after day of attacks": "Trump began by pre-empting Clinton's next salvo, a foreign policy speech Thursday aimed squarely at Trump, by suggesting the speech is full of \"such lies\" and capped off his denunciation of the Democrat by insisting Clinton \"should not be allowed to run\" because of her c\nontroversial use of a private email server\n during her time as secretary of state, which Trump said amounted to a breach of \"federal law.\"\nN.Y. attorney general on Trump University: 'This is straight up fraud'\nBetween those attacks, Trump also called Clinton \"a person with no actual talent,\" slammed her foreign policy decision-making as secretary of state and recycled an attack previously reserved for his GOP primary opponent, former Florida \nGov.

John McCain, said she had worked to re-acclimate veterans returning from combat and to extend their benefits, and said \"of course\" she had contributed personally as well. But she didn't provide further details, such as how much she donated and to whom.\nClinton's campaign on Tuesday tried to bracket Trump's press conference by pointing to a series of comments he has made about veterans and his proposals to fix the Veterans Administration. Her campaign and its surrogates organized calls to bash Trump, but Clinton -- who hasn't held a press conference since December 4 -- has been far less accessible to media than Trump.\nAsked about Trump's willingness to hold press conferences like Tuesday's, Clinton said that she had done \"nearly 300 interviews\" just in this calendar year, and pledged to answer reporters' queries \"in many different kinds of settings.\"\nYet she still must contend with Bernie Sanders, her Democratic rival who has pledged to carry his campaign all the way to the convention.

It is also affected by the candidates, voter mobilization efforts, the state of the economy and satisfaction with the direction of the country. \nBernie or bust: Sanders supporters vow to hold out\n\"While it might be a 'slam-dunk' that millennials soon will be the largest generation in the electorate, it will likely be a much longer time before they are the largest bloc of voters,\" wrote Pew Senior Researcher Richard Fry, who authored the report. ", "How Trump could win": "In just the past week, he's caused an uproar by blasting the Republican governor of New Mexico -- one of the party's most prominent Latinas -- while also calling Elizabeth Warren \"Pocahontas\" and abruptly parting ways with his recently hired political director.\nBut there are also signs that he's willing to moderate some of his primary positions and take more conventional steps to prepare for November, such as building out a national finance team, hiring a pollster, accepting checks from wealthy donors and hitting the fundraising circuit.\nTrump's strategy: Where he says he can win\n \nCNN interviewed more than a dozen veteran Republican campaign strategists, pollsters and past and current officeholders about what Trump needs to do to win.\nTheir consensus: He needs to flip blue-leaning states to his column, soften his public image -- particularly as he targets independents, women and minority voters -- and drive up Hillary Clinton's already high negatives even further.\nMost said Trump faces an uphill battle in a race that promises to be one of the most divisive and vitriolic in recent memory, one in which both Trump and Clinton have historically high unfavorable ratings.\nYet all agreed on one thing after a primary season that shattered conventional wisdom: Don't underestimate Trump. A recent Quinnipiac poll found Trump and Clinton in an extremely tight race in several vital swing states.\n\"Everything that so many of us have learned by observing politics for the last 30, 40 years is going to be challenged this cycle,\" said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to George W. Bush. \"Don't be surprised if Donald Trump is sitting in the Oval Office on January 20th.\"\nHere's a look at the Trump roadmap, based on these interviews:\nA whole new map\nTrump must win every state Mitt Romney did in 2012 -- plus an additional 64 electoral votes. In the past few elections, Republicans have looked to a handful of battleground states to put them over the top: among them, Virginia, Florida, Ohio and Colorado.\nThe \nQuinnipiac poll \nhad Trump and Clinton neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania and Ohio. \nStill, GOP veterans believe the traditional swing states make up a tough line-up for Trump. The Republican primaries consistently revealed Trump's weakness with minority and educated voters -- vulnerabilities that do not bode well for Trump in an increasingly blue state like Virginia. \nThe ugly fall campaign\n\"If you add up African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics in Virginia, which are all growing constituencies, that's about one third of the electorate,\" said Tucker Martin, a Virginia consultant and former aide to ex-Gov. Bob McDonnell. \"And then you combine the fact that we're a well-educated state -- it's a very bad match for him.\"\nMeanwhile, \nwestern states\n like Colorado with sizable Latino populations could also prove to be problematic for Trump. \n\"He can't lose the states that Romney won. If he starts losing states that Romney won, it's over,\" said political consultant John Brabender, who was a senior strategist to Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator who has endorsed Trump. \"The states that Romney thought were in play -- can Trump put them in play?\"\nAll eyes on the Rust Belt\nIn other words, Trump must redraw the map.\nThat means targeting states with demographics that favor Trump, such as blue collar, less educated and older white voters, and even competing in states that have consistently leaned blue in recent presidential elections. A key part of Trump's strategy is to ensure high turnout of white, working class Republican voters. But he's also looking to capture a segment of the Democratic base with his populist economic message. \n\"I really think he has an opportunity with working class Democrats, who we knew years ago as Reagan Democrats,\" said Michigan Republican strategist John Truscott. \"That's where his unique opportunity is to get some cross over.\"  \nAll of this brings Trump to the Rust Belt. \nResetting red and blue in the Rust Belt\nFormer Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, who ran for president this cycle and is now calling for the GOP to unite behind Trump, said he expects this region to be Trump's gateway to a November victory. \n\"If Donald Trump can hold the South, and I think he can, and all of a sudden become the spokesman for the disenfranchised working men and working women in the industrialized Midwest, suddenly he can be competitive in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota and Pennsylvania,\" Gilmore said. \n(Trump won three of those states -- Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania -- during the primaries). \nPennsylvania strategist Mark Harris believes the cards are stacked against Trump in the general election. The significance of Trump pulling off a victory in the Keystone State, which has not voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988, is difficult to overstate, he said.\n\"Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin -- those sorts of states I think are going to be important to his efforts. And certainly probably are friendlier than the Floridas and Colorados of the world,\" said Harris, who worked for Marco Rubio's super PAC.\nTrump's populist, economic message has deeply resonated in former industrial states across the Midwest and Northeast -- once the center of the country's manufacturing boom. \nAs part of a broader foreign policy view that promises to put \"America first,\" Trump regularly laments that the United States has become second-tier next to countries like China and Japan. Campaigning in areas where voter frustration and anger about the economy run deep, Trump has been relentless in his attacks on international trade agreements and companies that outsource jobs. \nIn the general election, \nTrump is expected to slam Clinton \nfor saying earlier this year that as President, she would \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"\nNew Jersey state Sen. Mike Doherty, one of Trump's earliest political supporters, said the key to Trump's success in the Rust Belt will have everything to do with the candidate staying on message on the economy. \n\"I would continue to focus on the United States has been de-industrialized, these international trade agreements have been a disaster and we need to make better deals,\" Doherty said. \"The real issue is the economy.\" \nA race to the bottom\nAs he stands on the cusp of formally accepting his party's nomination in July, Trump's unfavorable ratings are through the roof. Trump is determined to make Clinton equally toxic -- perhaps the only condition under which he can defeat her. \nNever have both the Democratic and Republican presumptive White House nominees suffered from such historically high negative ratings. \nA CNN/ORC poll \nthis month showed 56% of voters view Trump unfavorably, while 49% have a negative view of Clinton.  \n\"Both of them have such significant vulnerabilities that it's just a matter of whether there is a major stumble by either one of them or one campaign better exploits the weaknesses of the other,\" said Peter Ernaut, a Nevada GOP strategist. \"These actual campaigns are going to matter a lot.\"\nIt's an ugly match-up that could bring out an unprecedented level of vitriol in the general election.\nRepublicans believe Clinton's high negatives, fueled by the widespread perception that she is not honest or trustworthy, should be one of Trump's biggest advantages -- even as he is widely disliked himself. \n\"I'd make this campaign a race to the bottom,\" said Gregg Keller, who has advised Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. \"I believe the pathway to victory is not in convincing (some people) to vote, but convincing them not to vote at all.\"\nIn other words, Trump needs high turnout from his supporters while discouraging Clinton voters from showing up.\nTrump is already waging full war against Clinton. \nLabeling her \"Crooked Hillary,\" Trump has hit the former secretary of state on her qualifications, pointing to her past support for the Iraq War and her handling of the downfall of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. One scandal that's poised to continue haunting Clinton is her use of a private email server at the State Department, particularly after an Inspector General report released last week said she failed to follow proper protocol. \nTrump's attacks have not only targeted Clinton but also her husband. \nHe's revived controversies dating back to \nBill Clinton's presidency\n, including the former president's affair with Monica Lewinsky and other allegations of sexual misconduct. Last week, Trump dredged up one of the ugliest debunked conspiracy theories from the 1990s, telling The Washington Post that he believed there was something \"fishy\" about Vince Foster's death. Foster, who was a personal friend of the Clintons and served as Bill Clinton's White House deputy legal counsel, committed suicide. \nThe episode foreshadowed the bitterly personal feud that is likely to fuel the general election. \n\"Hillary Clinton has never run against a candidate with ten arms and eight legs like Donald Trump. He's going to be all over her,\" said GOP consultant Alex Castellanos. \"She couldn't figure out how to run against a skinny, first-term, U.S. senator named Hussein ... much less this political raptor, which is what Donald Trump is.\"\nTrump's rhetoric\nRepublicans agree that Trump's success so far has largely centered on his aggressive tone and his famous aversion to political correctness. \n\"He needs to double down on being Donald Trump, don't try to play to the middle, don't try to moderate, don't try to be anything that you're not,\" said Keller, the Scott Walker adviser. \"You have a brand that is recognizable to tons of people. Don't abandon that.\" \nBut Republicans also caution that the general election is an entirely different beast. Trump's political success has centered on his nontraditional rhetoric and approach to the nation's problems. But he still may need to find a way to moderate his tone for the broader general election audience.\nOne of Trump's biggest challenges heading into November is to broaden his appeal and convince non-primary voters to support him in November. That includes winning over independents and even some Democrats, and stopping the bleeding with minorities, younger voters as well as suburban and moderate Republicans -- particularly women. \n\"Make the tone a little bit more appealing to everybody -- make it a little bit more G-rated,\" said veteran pollster and strategist Jim McLaughlin. \"Make it so that that Walmart mom, that middle class mom, heck, that African-American mother, that Latino mother that is looking for the best for their children will say, you know what, he's got better ideas than Hillary Clinton does.\"\nLanhee Chen, a top policy adviser to Romney, said Trump must effectively beat back Clinton's suggestion that he is \"an unserious person for a serious time\" if he wants to broaden his base heading into November. A critical part of that, Chen said, is to get much more serious about policy. \n\"It would seem to me that the best way to counteract would be by saying, 'Look, I've got some serious ideas. And it doesn't need to be a 200-page policy book but it does need to be more than, 'We're going to get tough on China,'\" Chen said. \"That would be effective for both for independents but also for conservatives who have questions about what is this guy going to do.\"\nCORRECTION: \nThis story has been updated to reflect that Donald Trump would need to win 64 more electoral votes than Mitt Romney to win the election.", "Ruth Bader Ginsburg moniker graces new praying mantis species": "Researchers at The Cleveland Museum of Natural History on Wednesday \nsaid\n they were deeming a new species as the \nllomantis ginsburgae, \nnamed after Ginsburg because of her \"relentless fight for gender equality\" and out of  \"appreciation\" of her jabots, the neck accessories that she frequently dons. \nThe insects' neck plates are similar to them, the authors said.\nGinsburg was the second ever women nominated to the court, and she is one of three serving today.\nThe new species was identified primarily by comparing distinctive qualities of female genitalia, which is largely uncommon, Sydney Brannoch, one of the researchers, said in a video explaining the discovery.\n\"As a feminist biologist, I often questioned why female specimens weren't used to diagnose most species,\" Brannoch said in a statement. \"It is my hope that our work not only sets a precedent in taxonomy but also underscores the need for scientists to investigate and equally consider both sexes in other scientific investigations.\"", "Is Clinton 'uniquely vulnerable' to Trump?": "\"Of all of the Democratic possibilities that might have run, I think she's uniquely vulnerable to Trump because she symbolizes everything that he is telling people is wrong,\" political journalist Jeff Greenfield told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files,\" a podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \n\"Anything she throws at him ... 'You don't know anything!' 'Oh well, you knew everything -- that's why you voted for the war in Iraq and screwed up the Russia reset and Syria.' 'You're corrupt!' 'Really? How much money have I taken from Goldman Sachs to give speeches?' \" Greenfield said.\n\"Many Democrats voted for the war in Iraq. She is perhaps the only one who made an allegation that Saddam Hussein was somehow involved with al Qaeda and 9/11,\" Greenfield said. \"Everybody changed their mind about gay marriage. Almost everybody. But you look at what she said about that when she was on the other side, she talked about \none man, one woman \nmarriage as a building block, a foundation block of western civilization. When you commit yourself that strongly to position A, then a couple years later as the shift in wind goes on and you're in position not A, it gets harder.\"\nFurther complicating Clinton's chances of defeating Trump this fall, Greenfield noted that a large bloc of disgruntled voters may feel emboldened by the opportunity to elect the controversial real estate mogul.\n\"I think there's a period every so often in American political life -- not frequently -- when particularly aggrieved voters learn they can do something they didn't know they could do. That becomes a hugely powerful force,\" Greenfield said, citing the 2003 recall of California Gov. Gray Davis as an example. \"Beyond any particular policy issue or is there going to be a terrorist attack, that's the wild card. That's the black swan for me.\"\nDespite Clinton's vulnerabilities, Greenfield said that he would still wager on her to win the White House if given acceptable odds. \n\"If you gave me a certain amount of disposable income and asked me how to bet it, I would bet it on Hillary. But if the odds were right, I would want to have some back,\" he said. \nGreenfield, who writes for The Daily Beast and Politico and previously worked at CNN, CBS News, ABC News and PBS, stated that Trump has benefited this year from favorable media coverage.\n\"When you put a candidate on for an hour unfiltered, you might as well be state television in Havana putting on a speech by Fidel,\" he told Axelrod. \"I think the decision by the networks to let him phone it -- in literally phone it in -- because that meant ratings was a gift to him.

", "Republicans for Hillary?": "The Elmets of the Reagan era would never have predicted what he's now saying about the 2016 presidential race.\n\"I've never voted for a Democrat in my entire life. And I'll vote for my first Democrat when the ballots come out in November,\" said Elmets, who remains a registered Republican. \"I could live with four years of Hillary Clinton before I could ever live with one day of Donald Trump as president.\"\nIt's an astonishing statement for the Republican consultant and former operative who began his career as a White House staff assistant to conservative powerhouses Ed Rollins and Lee Atwater in 1981 at the dawn of the Reagan administration. \nElmets became a White House spokesman under long-time presidential adviser David Gergen and then moved onto the campaign trail for Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign. He later served as press secretary for the Department of Energy until he moved to California to work in public relations, policy and political consulting.\nHe's now using his decades of political capital to promote the once unthinkable: Hillary Clinton for president. Elmets said she's more qualified than the \"xenophobic and scary\" Trump.\n\"I don't believe Donald Trump is a Republican. I think Donald Trump is a brand. And he's managed to hoodwink America into believing he will lead this country through the fire. I think he will thrust us into the fire,\" he said.\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nElmets joins what's being called on Twitter, #RepublicansforHillary. At times mocked on social media or a hashtag invoked by both sides to insult the other, the moniker borrows from the notion of the \"Reagan Democrats,\" who crossed party lines to vote Republican, drawn to the charismatic Ronald Reagan in 1980. \nElmets and others like him bet Donald Trump will have the opposite effect -- propelling Republicans to the Democrats' candidate.\nThe sentiment is expanding beyond social media to active support by known Republicans for Clinton. Elmets is not the only known Republican to do so. Hedge fund manager William Oberndorf, who has contributed approximately $1.5 million in the last year to Republican candidates and causes, told CNN in a statement: \"If it is Trump vs. Clinton, and there is no viable third party candidate, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.\" \nOberndorf stressed he will not financially support Clinton or any Democratic PACs, but his denial of funding or support for the presumptive Republican nominee is clear.\nRecent polls show the numbers of Republicans breaking toward Clinton does remain under 10% among self-identified Republicans. \nAn ABC News/Washington Post poll\n found 8% of self-identified Republicans support Clinton, 7% in a \nFox News poll\n, and 6% in both a \nCBS News/New York Times\n and \nNBC News/Wall Street Journal\n poll.\nThose single-digit figures are nearly on par with what Democratic candidates snagged from Republicans in exit polls in recent presidential election years. President Barack Obama and Democratic candidates John Kerry (2004) and Al Gore (2000) all won between 6%-8% support from Republicans, according to exit poll data.\nBut should the national race between Trump and Clinton run close, as recent polling suggests, the \"Republicans for Hillary\" supporters could be a voting bloc, not simply a snarky social media hashtag.\n\"I do think there are a lot of disenfranchised Republicans who can't believe Donald Trump will be or should be the nominee,\" said Elmets, adding Trump lacks a moral compass or the core values of the party. \"I believe as the campaign evolves and Donald Trump continues down this path, Hillary Clinton is going to look like a much more sympathetic character than she might today. Republicans will come along eventually. I do think they will do it publicly at some point or they'll privately do it in the polling booth in November.\"\nPublicly, national GOP leaders are warming to their presumptive nominee. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Lindsay Graham have moved away from more hardline positions on Trump to call for party unity. Former 2016 rival Marco Rubio, who famously sparred with Trump just a few months ago, said: \"I want to be helpful, I don't want to be harmful because I don't want Hillary Clinton to be president.\"\nElmets refuses to follow those prominent leaders in his party, saying the GOP must look inward and evolve away from Trump. He said watching the violence and anger at Trump events only proves to him why Reagan Republicans need to vote for Clinton.\n\"I, like so many people throughout the world, are horrified by what we see coming alive on our TVs as we see people fighting and disrupting. The rallies are an indication of where America is going if Donald Trump gets elected President. Is that what we want?\"", "Trump calls for Clinton to be jailed": "\"I will say this, Hillary Clinton has got to go to jail,\" Trump told supporters here as he slammed Clinton's foreign policy speech earlier in the day in which Clinton called Trump dangerous and \n\"temperamentally unfit\"\n to be president.\n\"Folks, honestly, she's guilty as hell,\" Trump said of the Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.\nTrump has previously accused Clinton of breaking federal law, but his comments on Thursday are his most direct call yet for Clinton to face jail time over her use of private email to conduct official State Department affairs.\nThe FBI is \ninvestigating\n Clinton's use of a private emails to determine whether anyone improperly handled classified information.\nAt a news conference earlier this week, Trump declined to say whether he believes Clinton's private email use amounted to a felony.\nTrump also suggested Thursday that if Clinton is not indicted over her email use, he would direct his attorney general to investigate her.\n\"Five years' statute of limitations, if I win. Everything is going to be fair but I'm sure the attorney general will take a very good look at it,\" Trump said.\nTrump peppered his speech Thursday with digs at Clinton but largely avoided responding directly to many of the claims Clinton leveled against him earlier in the day, in which she accused the presumptive Republican nominee of having \"dangerously incoherent\" ideas on foreign policy.\nInstead, Trump hit Clinton over her email use and critiqued Clinton's speaking style, suggesting that \"it's hard to stay awake\" when listening to Clinton speak. ", "Trump vs. the press": "The billionaire had called the news conference to announce an accounting of his at least $5.6 million in fundraising for veterans groups, but spent most of the 40 minutes criticizing and insulting reporters -- collectively and at times individually -- as \"dishonest,\" \"not good people,\" sleazy, and among the worst human beings he has ever met.\nAnd he vowed the White House briefing room would be just as combative as the Trump Tower lobby, where the developer addressed reporters Tuesday, should he ascend to the Oval Office. \nLibertarian lays out agenda, blows kiss to Trump\n\"Yeah, it is going to be like this,\" Trump said when asked if this is how he would behave with the press as president. \"You think I'm gonna change? I'm not gonna change.\"\nAt one point, Trump fumed: \"I'm the only one in the world who can raise almost $6 million for the veterans, have uniform applause by the veterans groups, and end up being criticized by press.\"\n\"I think the political press is among the most dishonest people that I have ever met, I have to tell you. I see the stories, and I see the way they're couched,\" he added.\nTrump: Sessions 'absolutely' to be considered for VP\nThe news conference did not mark a radical departure from Trump's relationship with the press, which has been strained throughout the brash mogul's year-long campaign -- but Tuesday was a surprise escalation, especially at a time when many supporters want him to start acting more presidential. \nOver the last year, Trump has repeatedly called out individual reporters on Twitter and in interviews for everything from what he viewed as insufficient crowd camera shots to biased reporting. And attacking the press is a regular part of the presumptive Republican nominee's stump speech, during which he typically rips reporters as \"scum,\" \"slime,\" \"dishonest\" and \"disgusting\" \u2014 often prompting jeers from the crowd.\nNorth Korean state media op-ed calls Trump 'wise,' Clinton 'dull'\nThe news conference came four months after Trump claimed to have raised $6 million for veterans groups, but then dodged reporters' questions about which groups had received the donations. \nTrump kicked off his litany of media attacks Tuesday by accusing reporters of cynically turning what should have been a positive story about his charitable work into a negative one.\nReporters had for months repeatedly asked Trump to provide an accounting of the donations, requests that were frequently rebuffed or side-stepped by Trump and his campaign staff.\nKristol, Trump trade fresh blows after talk of independent candidate\nTrump said Tuesday he didn't \"want the credit\" for his fundraising, \"but I shouldn't be lambasted.\" \nHillary Clinton later told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead\" that Trump did not deserve any credit for following through on his promise, arguing that he had only done so because of increased scrutiny of the donations from the media.\n\"Look, I'm glad he finally did it, but I don't know that he should get much credit,\" she told Tapper. \"It took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution.\"\nThe subject of the news conference quickly turned away from the veterans donations as Trump accused reporters of writing stories they \"know\" to be false, and of spinning the truth.\nHe lashed out at individual reporters, calling ABC's Tom Llamas a \"sleaze,\" referring sarcastically to CNN's Jim Acosta's live reports as a \"beauty,\" and refusing at one point to call on CBS's Major Garrett.\nPoll: Clinton, Trump running tight race in NJ\nTrump repeatedly blasted the media for the way it has covered his fundraising for vets.\n\"All of the money has been paid out,\" Trump said. \"The press should be ashamed of themselves, and on behalf of the veterans, the press should be ashamed of themselves.\" \n\"There are so many people who are so thankful for what we did,\" Trump said, adding that the  final figure could top $6 million once all the donations are in. \nTrump listed the vets groups --  there were more than 40 -- that he said had received money and the amounts given to each. He said there were no administrative costs deducted from the donations. \nWould Donald Trump have killed the gorilla?\nTrump himself gave $1 million last week to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, a charity that helps support the families of fallen Marines and law enforcement officers to which Trump's foundation has previously donated. \nAmid reporters' questions over the last few months, Trump and his campaign have repeatedly offered conflicting accounts of how much money was raised. The campaign has insisted it was working on disbursing the funds, but said it was waiting on some donors to make good on their pledges and also needed time to properly vet the charities in the running to receive the funds. \nThree veterans groups earlier Tuesday confirmed donations from the Trump Foundation. The Bob Woodruff Foundation and the Boston Wounded Vets Run each got $75,000. The Racing For Heroes Foundation also received what the group's president described as a \"large\" donation.\nClinton's campaign on Tuesday morning fired off a statement tweaking Trump over his accounting of the donations amid a multi-pronged push to counter Trump's news conference.\nAnd Clinton herself clashed with Trump's description on Tuesday that she had done \"nothing\" on veterans' behalf, pointing to money she raised for the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund alongside Arizona Sen. John McCain and work done to re-acclimate veterans returning from combat.\nShe said \"of course\" she had contributed personally as well. But she didn't provide further details, such as how much she donated and to whom.", "America's damaged pipelines are 'ticking time bomb'": "Long a source of national pride, America's infrastructure is in critical need of repair, but federal government spending on the issue has gone down 9% in the past decade. As former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood says, \"We're like a third-world country when it comes to infrastructure.\" \nCNN aviation and regulation correspondent Rene Marsh investigates the state of the country's bridges, railways, airports and pipelines in a four-part series: America's Crumbling Infrastructure. Check back here from now through Monday.\nPart 4: Damaged pipelines and a \"ticking time bomb\"\nThe government says strung together they would run more than 90,000 miles.\nHigh-risk pipelines carrying essential but dangerous fuels like natural gas run under the streets and buildings of dozens of major American cities. And when they go bust, the results can be deadly.\nEight-year-old Troy Douglas was killed walking home from school when an explosion rocked his Baltimore neighborhood in 2014. The pipelines in the vicinity of the disaster ranged from 84 to 106 years old, some of them cracked and corroded.\nBaltimore Gas and Electric, the utility company responsible for the piping, was unable to determine the cause of the blast. State investigators blamed a natural gas leak. Investigators found a cracked and corroded six-inch line planted during the Great Depression in the area of the explosion. Records show the same pipe had been repaired twice in the previous months leading up to the explosion.\n\"It just didn't need to happen,\" said Mark McDonald, a natural gas expert who investigated the explosion on behalf of the family. \"It was a ticking time bomb.\"\nThe utility company settled with the Douglas family for an undisclosed amount. Still, the utility company told CNN, the old pipeline that runs adjacent to the exploded building has not been replaced, only patched.\nBetween 2006 and 2015, incidents similar to the one in Baltimore have killed an average of 13 people annually. Fifty-nine are injured every year, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The Federal agency is the division of the U.S. Department of Transportation responsible for federal oversight of these pipelines.\nThe natural gas industry says it is actively replacing aging pipelines, but the rate of replacement depends on dollars available. The pipelines belong to the energy companies, who are responsible for paying the cost of repair and replacements -- expenses that are ultimately passed onto consumers. The industry says there are caps on how much it can raise customer rates to fund its aging pipeline replacement program.  A Department of Energy report estimates it would cost $270 billion to replace all of the aging pipelines.\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, whose department is tasked with overseeing pipeline safety regulations, told CNN standards are improving and enforcement has ramped up. \n\"We are putting in place the regime to ensure that we will not only be a leader in energy production, but a leader in safe energy production, and these efforts are underway,\" he said.\nBut of the 42 requirements Congress mandated for pipeline safety in 2011, only 26 have been completed by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety, a division of the Department of Transportation.\nAdministration a division of DOT, has only completed 26 of the requirements, according to a written statement from the federal regulator to Congress. One recent addition puts a new focus on dangerous, aging pipes.\nThe rule took five years to get in place. DOT tells CNN it will continue to develop stricter regulations for the natural gas industry but government red tape makes it a slow process.\nPart 3: Funding delays ground flights and cancel commercial ambition\nCommercial air travel in America is primed for a summer surge. \nMore than 230 million passengers are expected to fly in the coming months. But packed flights also mean long security lines, delayed departures, missed connections and more frustrated passengers than ever before.\nOutdated and overcrowded airports are in dire need of upgrades. Once at the forefront of aviation innovation, U.S. flight hubs in the 21st century are falling far behind their international competitors.\n\"People are going through airports built in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s,\" says Kevin Burke, president and CEO of Airports Council International. That infrastructure, largely unchanged for decades, is struggling now to service a nearly 12-fold spike in passenger volume across the decades.\nTraveler frustration has made for some rare common cause among quarreling presidential candidates and political leaders.\n\"Our airports are, like, third world,\" Donald Trump said in February. Vice President Joe Biden used the same term to describe New York's LaGuardia Airport after a 2014 visit. On the campaign trail in January, Hillary Clinton said she was upset \"that we don't have a single airport in our country that is considered in the top 25 in the world.\"\nDoug Parker, the CEO of American Airlines, says the rhetoric doesn't match the reality.\n\"If you go to any airline check-in counter today, you won't see long lines,\" he tells CNN. \"We made huge investments in making it much easier for customers to get from -- you know, from their cars to the airplane without waiting in long lines other than TSA. But that's not an infrastructure issue.\"\nBut for many frequent fliers, it's hard to tell where one hold-up ends and the next backlog begins. \nIn Kansas City, its airport has ranked among the nations worst. New York and Los Angeles have earned a spot on the worst airports list in the past as well, mainly because of outdated terminals that cannot meet passenger capacity demand.  \n\"We have gates that don't accommodate the A380, or expanded 747, or some of the modern aircraft that will be there,\" Burke says. \"Somebody has to pay for that. In order to accommodate new aircraft, you have to adjust the airport. You have to adjust the taxiways.\"\nNew money is on the way for some airports, but a varied funding mechanism \u2014 the airlines, along with the federal, state and local governments, all chip in \u2014 often complicate the matter. The federal tax used to pay for airport construction projects, usually baked into passenger airfare, hasn't been adjusted for inflation in 16 years.\nThe simpler, more robust systems powering global hubs show just how far the U.S. lags behind.\nSouth Korea's Incheon International, located about 90 minutes outside Seoul, consistently ranks as one of the best in the world. With showers, spas and an on-site hotel, travelers can enjoy a concert while shopping at high-end retail stores.\nThe Airport Council International says Congress would need to invest an estimated $75 billion over the next five years to begin to compete with the government-subsidized gems in Asia and the Middle East. \n\"It's not a fair fight,\" Burke says. \"Their governments recognize the importance of airports. Our government says it does, but they need to show it by increasing funding for us.\"\nParker also points to the need for upgrades to the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control system.\nCreated in the 1960s, during the first flight boom, the technology hasn't quite kept up with the times. Upgrading to real-time GPS locators that could unsnag air traffic and speed up arrivals.\n\"It takes longer to fly from Point A to Point B in the United States than it should,\" Parker says. \nFor an industry that brings in about $1.6 trillion annually for the American economy, every second counts.\nPart 2: The busiest rails shut down by failing power cables\nThe Portal Bridge in New Jersey is the most heavily trafficked rail span in the Western Hemisphere. Connecting New Jersey to New York City's Penn Station, an estimated 450 trains cross it every 24 hours. \nBelow -- sometimes not much more than 25 feet down -- is the Hackensack River, itself a busy thoroughfare for boats and barges. To accommodate both, the Portal Bridge operates on a swing-span, allowing it to open for watercraft, then close up again to complete the rail path.\n\"The problem we have is that, as it swings back, those miters don't always come down right, because this thing is so old,\" explains Amtrak CEO Joe Boardman.\nAnd when those \"miters\" don't line up correctly, train traffic grinds to a halt.\n\"So then you have to get crews out here,\" Boardman says. \"That holds up a lot of trains, no matter what time of the day it is.\"\nThe Portal Bridge, like so much of America's archaic and often wonky infrastructure, was designed in the 19th century and built more than a hundred years ago. \nBut funding for the construction of a new passage is finally forthcoming -- and the project to replace the rails is underway.\nLess than nine miles east, the tunnel that connects Jersey City to Manhattan is cracked and crumbling. \nThe 106-year-old Hudson River Tunnel connects more than 230,000 commuters daily, but in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 it has been plagued by power failures, causing shutdowns and days-long delays.\n\"This salt is eating away at the concrete, it's eating away at the rails, it's eating away at the cables that go through here for power,\" says Boardman, who describes it as one of the most disturbing examples of an infrastructure system long ignored or deprived of needed maintenance.\nThe price of renewing and safeguarding the web of railways that runs up Amtrak's \"Northeast Corridor\" -- more than 450 miles -- stands at an estimated $20 billion.\nThe cost for passengers has been steeper. \nIn May 2015, an Amtrak passenger train traveling more than twice the 50 mile per hour speed limit jumped the tracks in Philadelphia. Eight people were killed and more than 200 riders were injured.\nThe deadly derailment might have been prevented if the tracks had been fitted with a technology called \"Positive Train Control,\" an innovation that automatically slows speeding rail traffic.\nSo what's taking so long?\n\"It takes time to make sure it works right,\" Boardman says. Across the country, 30 freight and passenger train accidents, 69 deaths, and more than 1,200 injuries could have been prevented had the technology been in place, according to the NTSB.  \nWith Congress tied up in partisan knots over new spending, the bullet trains of Japan -- which cruise at nearly 200 miles per hour and could cut in half the travel time between Boston and Washington, D.C. -- seem a long way off. Implementing a similar system along the northeast corridor would come with a price tag exceeding $151 billion.\n\"You want to be able to show the benefit of the dollar you invested,\" Transportation Department head Anthony Foxx tells CNN. \"I think members of Congress struggle, because (these projects) actually require longer than a political term to take root.\"\nShort term thinking leads to long term trouble, and for the busiest strip of track in the Americas, the crumbling is becoming more difficult -- and dangerous -- to ignore.\nPart 1: Bridges supported by crumbling 90-year-old beams\nNearly 60,000 bridges across the country are in desperate need of repair. One example is just down the street from the White House and Capitol Hill. In the nation's capital, 68,000 vehicles cross the Arlington Memorial Bridge between Washington and Virginia every day. CNN was granted rare access to go inside the crumbling bridge. \n\"It's just eroding and concrete is falling off,\" said National Park Service spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles as she showed how the \noriginal support beams from 1932\n are corroding. The beams have never been replaced, and the bridge could be closed to vehicle traffic within five years if it isn't fixed. It'll cost $250 million.\n \nIn 1932, as the Arlington Memorial Bridge was being erected, Congress was dealing with the Great Depression. That same year, President Herbert Hoover enacted the first federal gas tax at 1 cent per gallon. The gas tax is a major source of funding for bridges and roads that has been raised periodically until 1993, when it was set at 18.4 cents per gallon.\nAlthough the gas tax has remained steady, cars have become more efficient and overall federal government spending on infrastructure has declined 9% from 2003-14, according to the Congressional Budget Office. According to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, every state has some degree of bad bridges that need to be repaired. In Los Angeles, CNN found trees growing out of cracks in a bridge. In Chicago, netting is in place to protect drivers from falling concrete.  \nLaHood was a rare Republican who served in President Barack Obama's administration. He says there's an easy way to fund upgrades to an infrastructure system that has become \"third-world\": Raise the gas tax. LaHood and others blame Congress for failing to raise the gas tax in 23 years. \nRepublican Rep. Bill Shuster, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said raising the gas tax \"doesn't solve the long-term funding problem.\" But Congress has not yet come up with a solution. \nBeyond funding, there is another issue: how to make the bridges better. Researchers at the University of Michigan believe they may have a fix: bendable concrete that can heal itself from cracks. Demonstration in the university's engineer lab shows regular concrete can fail quickly and suddenly.  Professor Victor Li, who developed the technology over the past 10 years, said the bendable concrete can withstand a force hundreds of times more powerful than standard concrete. The researchers' hope is that it could help already crumbling bridges, like the Memorial Bridge near the nation's capital. \nBut new concrete is expensive. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, bridge infrastructure investment needs to be increased by $8 billion annually. The society said that increase would address the estimated $76 billion in needs for deficient bridges across the United States.\n ", "Libertarian lays out agenda, blows kiss to Trump": "In an interview on CNN's \"New Day,\" Johnson laid out his political agenda for the \"tens of millions of Americans who have no idea what it is to be a Libertarian.\" \n\"How about the best of both worlds? The notion of being fiscally conservative and socially liberal -- the notion that smaller government is something that really is desirable, that government taxes too much...look, [I] always come down on the side of people being able to make their own choices in their own lives, as long as those choices don't adversely affect others,\" Johnson said. \nLibertarian Party chair hopeful strips at convention\nThe former New Mexico governor, who was nominated this weekend and will have former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld as his running mate, also responded to doubts host CNN's Chris Cuomo raised about the appeal of so-called Rockefeller Republicans in an increasingly polarized political environment. \n\"I would argue that most Republicans, even though they might be socially conservative, don't want to make that public policy. Because at the end of the day if you make social conservatism public policy, you end up putting people in jail for their choices,\" Johnson replied, pointing to high levels of incarceration due to U.S. drug policy. \nJohnson outlined his non-interventionist foreign policy thinking as well, arguing against military campaigns with \"unintended consequences\" that make the world \"less safe.\" He also voiced concern about the dozens of treaties \"where we are obligated to defend [other countries'] borders, and none of those treaties have been authorized by Congress.\" \nSizzling summer of politics ahead\nAnd he was critical of what he described as a misguided effort against ISIS.  \n\"I would go into this with the intention of getting our troops out of the Middle East. I would go into this with the intention of not flying drones and killing thousands of innocent people. That's the way I would go into this, and if there's an argument on the other side, let's hear it. Let's get it out in the open,\" he said. \nJohnson also indicated his willingness to go after Trump with vigor, hitting him hard for his positions on immigration and rejecting Trump's argument that many immigrants are criminals. \n\"Statistically -- legal, illegal immigrants commit far less crime than U.S. citizens,\" Johnson explained. \nGary Johnson wins Libertarian presidential nomination at party convention\nJohnson also said he supports a system \"whereby it would be easy to get a work visa\" allowing people crossing the border to be identified by Border Patrol instead of a situation where \"mothers with children that are actually wading across the Rio Grande because of jobs.\" \nIf Johnson's long-shot bid does gain traction and he begins to threaten presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's candidacy, then Trump's brief political history suggests that Johnson will quickly become the target of his signature onslaughts. But don't tell Gary Johnson to worry. \n\"Are you ready for Trump?,\" Cuomo asked Johnson. \n\"I think they've already started coming -- so, Donald?\" Johnson laughed, as he blew a kiss through the camera.\nAsked about Johnson later Tuesday, Trump dismissed his candidacy.\n\"I think he's a fringe candidate, to tell you the truth,\" Trump said at a news conference at Trump Tower in New York.\nJohnson quickly \nfired back\n on Twitter: \"So @realDonaldTrump calls me a fringe candidate. Strangely enough, that's what he was called a few months ago #tlot\"", "Trump's obsession with himself": "From his condemnation of journalists to his racially tinged attacks on a judge presiding over a lawsuit related to Trump University to his feud with New Mexico GOP Gov. Susana Martinez, there's one thing in common about the mounting Trump controversies: The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is aiming to make the entire 2016 campaign about himself.\nAmerican politics is littered with larger-than-life personalities. But no presidential candidate in living memory has built a campaign so exclusively on the foundation of his own personal, brand, self-congratulatory rhetoric and life story as Trump. And don't expect anything different if he makes it to the White House.\n\"You think I'm going to change?\" he told reporters at a press conference this week. \"I'm not going to change.\"\nTrump vs. the press\nTrump has prospered by being the loudest, most unapologetic salesman of self in politics that most seasoned observers have ever seen. He is not just the figurehead of his own campaign -- his personality is the campaign, as evidenced by stump speeches, press conferences and endless television and radio interviews that add up to an unstoppable torrent of self-promotion. \n\"The Trump campaign is not about any cause, it is all about Trump,\" said Peter Wehner, who has watched candidates and presidents up close as an aide in the last three Republican administrations. \"His campaign is all about him. How he treats other people is all about him -- whether one is praised and patted on the head or cruelly mocked depends on what you have said about him.\"\nTrump's self-aggrandizement has become a dominant theme of the presidential campaign.\nThe billionaire boasts about his wealth, his portfolio of gleaming buildings and golf resorts, soaring poll numbers, the size of his crowds, his \"crazy\" television ratings, how Mexicans will love him, how his book is an all time best-seller and how his 757 jet is superior to Air Force One.\nEgo-driven strategy\nIt's an ego-driven strategy that would doom most politicians.\nBut, so far, Trump's unique, personal and unconventional campaign style has worked. He's dispatched his rivals in a bloated Republican field and is now locked in a tight general election duel with Hillary Clinton. His style could even help him win over disaffected workers who also seem themselves as victimized by the political and economic establishment.\nStill, there are major questions about whether a personality-driven campaign -- lacking the traditional organizational and field skills -- can be successful during a complex national contest.\nThe Clinton campaign is working overtime to make Trump's personal mythologizing look like a fatal flaw. The former secretary of state is mounting a two-pronged strategy that centers directly on Trump's persona. She hopes to make a case that his volatile personality makes him unsuitable to be commander-in-chief and to use incidents from his colorful character and business career to deconstruct Trump's carefully built self image.\n\"He is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump University,\" \nClinton said Wednesday\n, referring to the growing scrutiny surrounding Trump's namesake training programs. \nClinton will keep up the attacks Thursday during a\n foreign policy speech \nin San Diego. An aide said Clinton will use the address to \"rebuke the fear, bigotry and misplaced defeatism that Trump has been selling to the American people.\"\nTrump's allies dismiss the idea that his campaign style lacks the gravitas and temperament required of a President, arguing that his tirades against the press, for instance, are merely a result of unfair coverage. \n'A temperament question'\n\"Many of the reporters know the facts, but choose to write horrible stories about him or portray him in a negative light,\" Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson told CNN's \"New Day\" on Wednesday, adding that if Trump becomes President he will have wide public support. \"So it's not going to get to the point of a temperament question because the people will be behind Mr. Trump.\"\nTrump is hardly alone in getting high on himself: Self-confidence is synonymous with politics.\nBut presidential candidates typically take pains to mask their personal ambition in a flurry of detailed policy positions and ostentatious attempts to feel the voters' pain. \nEx-employees on Trump University: 'A fraudulent scheme' and 'a total lie'\nPeter Feaver, a former aide to President George W. Bush, said Trump's reliance on his personality is unique.\n\"This persona is actually one he has been honing for decades,\" said Feaver, a former senior National Security Council official, noting that unlike other big personalities that took aim at the presidency, Trump lacked core ideological convictions.\n\"Take Ronald Reagan for instance. He clearly had a persona that was built up over decades but even more he had a governing philosophy even as he was developing a persona,\" Fever said. \"Trump doesn't have that. He just has the persona.\"\nFeaver also notes the irony that after spending eight years lambasting President Barack Obama as a hubristic, self-obsessed figure, Republicans are about to nominate someone who takes those perceived deficiencies to extremes.\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is not known for introspection. But he seems to agree with critics who say the campaign is almost exclusively about himself.\n\"A very good musician said Trump is the greatest in the world without a guitar, meaning without an instrument. I've got to stand up here by myself,\" Trump said in California last week, explaining his unique style of political performance art.\nHe want on to boast how a good friend -- who was \"by the way, one of the most successful people in the country, in the world\" -- asked him how he was able to hold such large audiences in the palm of his hand.\n\"I said, 'You know, honestly, it's not hard because there's so much love in the room. It's unbelievable.'\"\nSuch comments, laced throughout Trump's public appearances, reveal a politician apparently intoxicated with his own magnetism and brimming with self belief.\nContrasting with conventional nominees\nAnd they contrast with the stump speeches of more conventional political nominees -- which sag with policies designed to lure various constituencies of a party and cliched invocations to a higher national purpose and political unity that Trump's speeches conspicuously lack.\nHis public appearances, while hitting top political points on illegal immigration, free trade and U.S. allies who he says are fleecing America, are effectively a list of his personal triumphs -- that seem like the obsessions of a billionaire and have little in common with his heartland audiences.\nHe frequently relates the tale of his new hotel in Washington in the city's old Post Office building which he says will come in under budget and ahead of schedule and will be \"a higher-quality hotel than anybody ever saw before.\" And he often recalls the media frenzy as he and his wife Melania descended the escalator at Trump tower to launch his campaign last year, saying it \"looked, literally, like the Academy Awards.\"\nWhen Trump hits back, he hits back hard\nTrump's implicit case is that his personality is so dominant, his presence alone makes the need for detailed policy proposals moot. That's why when he vows to rescue health care for veterans, he doesn't say how he will get it done. He promises to bring back jobs from Mexico and China -- again without revealing his approach. He says he will \"knock the hell out of ISIS\" but doesn't detail a credible military strategy. \nGiven the billionaire's somewhat ill defined political creed and unpredictable style, no one can say for sure what his presidency would be like.\nBut if the campaign is anything to go by, one thing is certain: it would be all about Trump.", "Feds at odds over charges in Eric Garner case": "As recently as three months ago, the Justice Department Civil Rights Division in Washington appeared close to announcing charges, law enforcement officials briefed on the probe said. \nBut objections from several officials overseeing the case, including from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn and the FBI, have at least temporarily shelved those plans.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said the investigation is still ongoing and no decisions have been made.   \nFederal prosecutors in recent months have been \nusing a grand jury in Brooklyn\n as part of their probe, CNN has previously reported. The focus of the investigation has been on whether NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo used excessive force and broke the law in trying to arrest Garner for selling untaxed cigarettes. \nPantaleo was shown on video, recorded by a bystander, using what witnesses said appeared to be a chokehold technique during the Garner takedown. The NYPD bans the use of chokeholds. Garner could be heard saying \"I can't breathe\" in the video, a phrase that became rallying cry for street protesters in the wake of a spate of police-involved deaths. \nPantaleo's attorney, Stuart London, said: \"I've never thought any federally protected constitutional right was ever violated. This was a simple street encounter with no specific intent to ever violate his civil rights. It is very frustrating for my client to have this cloud still remain.\"\nThe Justice Department investigation in Garner case has faced numerous hurdles. New York state law provides immunity to anyone who testifies to a grand jury, which meant that the FBI agents and prosecutors working the case had to take extra steps to gather evidence for their probe. \nAnd another complication is a dispute of whether Pantaleo used a chokehold, and if so for how long and whether it was enough force to kill Garner. Some officials involved in the case believe the evidence evidence is not conclusive. \nCases like this are notoriously hard ones to make and relatively few result in federal civil rights charges against a police officer, law enforcement officials said. \nSome officials led by Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers and FBI agents investigating the case have advised superiors that there isn't enough evidence to bring charges, the law enforcement officials said.\nIn a statement to CNN, Justice Department spokesperson Dena Iverson said, \"The Garner investigation is being handled in a manner similar to many of our civil rights investigations, where experienced prosecutors from both the U.S. Attorney's office and the Civil Rights Division jointly investigate the case. In every single case the department brings -- including civil rights matters -- the department reaches one decision regarding whether charges can responsibly be brought at the conclusion of the investigation. The investigation into the death of Eric Garner is active and ongoing and no decisions have been made regarding the outcome of the case.\"\nA spokeswoman for the FBI declined comment. A spokeswoman for the Brooklyn U.S. Attorney didn't comment.\nOne official involved in the matter said disputes over the strength of a case are a normal part of discussions before deciding whether to bring charges. \"That's how we test the strength of our cases,\" the official said. \nLast year, a New York state grand jury declined to charge Pantaleo in a separate case investigated by the Staten Island district attorney. \nIn cases of alleged police misconduct, state laws offer more broad authority to bring charges. Federal charges are considered a fall back because federal law has much narrower jurisdiction. ", "It's time for GOP to reinvent itself": "The 2016 presidential election should have been an opportunity to improve the party's relationship with these constituencies, but now the party's entire identity has now been hijacked by Donald Trump's brand of misogyny. \nThere was a time, at least rhetorically, when Republicans endeavored to advance the notion of \nbeing \na \"Big Tent\" \nparty\n. The party of inclusion and \"\nbig ideas\n.\"\nUnfortunately, instead of debating big ideas, the most vocal leaders in today's Republican Party spend \nmore time talking\n about punishing women for exercising their legally protected rights and deporting everyone else.\nNow, let me just say for those that assume this is being written by a Democrat, that I am, in fact, a Republican.  I've spent the bulk of my adult life working for Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-CA). \nAs a millennial, I have grown up in a rapidly evolving culture that has created very different social and political environments than the ones my parents' generation encountered. As a result, I look around today and don't see a real place in the GOP for anyone who is pro-choice, supports gay marriage and women's rights, is fine with anyone using a bathroom, believes in climate change (aka science) but also believes in a limited government, a strong national defense and in the power of free enterprise. \nI know many of my fellow Republicans want to see our party continue to evolve to be more inclusive of all Americans regardless of gender, age or race. We've wasted the bulk of our congressional majority being angry and where has it gotten us?\nThat's why I believe the time has come for the Republican Party and its leaders to stop operating from a place of fear. To stop bending to the will of the angriest among us who are impossible to please and instead embrace a policy agenda that will create more equality, fairness and prosperity for all. \nThe frustration with the political establishment in Washington is visceral and real. \"Average\" Americans feel as though Washington has abandoned them and sold them out to protect or further their own personal political aspirations.\nThey are right. That's exactly what has happened.\nSo many members of Congress cast votes, day in and day out, not because they believe in the merits of a bill but because they are fearful of how \"the base\" will react. They are terrified of facing a primary challenge from a candidate who attacks them on their political left or right. \nUnfortunately for the rest of us, appeasing that demographic comes at the expense of a relationship with women, minorities, young adults and college students, making it all but impossible to win a national general election.\nThe effect of that fear has been a political system that now rewards gridlock and extreme rhetoric and locks out new voices who might re-animate the party. I know we can be so much more than just the party of the loudest and angriest. And in fact, if we don't evolve beyond being just that, there won't much of a party left by the presidential election of 2020.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.", "World War II Marine, missing for more than 70 years, buried in Arlington": "For more than seven decades, he had been missing in action. During those long years, his family and a non-governmental organization dedicated to finding the remains of U.S. service members joined together to continue the search.\nLast June, the History Flight NGO made a major discovery: a mass grave on the small island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. It was close to the site of the Battle of Tarawa where the U.S. clashed with the Japanese on November 20, 1943, and more than 1,000 Americans perished, the 19-year-old Johnson among them.\nUsing DNA, scientists from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which works closely with History Flight, was able to match Johnson's remains to a living nephew. Identification was also made possible by circumstantial and material evidence and dental records, according to the agency.\nMark Noah, the executive director of History Flight, told CNN that he welcomed the opportunity to \"to pay my respects and help close the circle\" by attending Johnson's burial at Arlington National Cemetery.\nThe funeral was held with full military honors. A Marine firing party shot three rifle volleys into the air, a 20-member Marine band played at the gravesite and a Marine funeral platoon participated in the ceremony, which was attended by Johnson's surviving relatives, giving them an opportunity for closure after a seven-decades-long wait.\nAfter a Marine bugler played \"Taps,\" the ceremonial burial flag, which was draped over Johnson's coffin, was folded and presented by Marine Sgt. Maj. Joseph Garay, of the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., to Johnson's next of kin, his nephew, James C. Johnson, who provided the DNA for the test and is himself a decorated Special Forces Vietnam veteran.\nNoah said that the nephew had approached him eight years ago and asked if the organization had any information about his uncle.\nHe said that the organization had made 30 missions to the Tarawa Atoll in order to identify and recover the remains of missing Marines there, working with the Department of Defense on helping to identify missing military personnel.\nRELATED: Obama marks last Memorial Day in office\nThe military made efforts to recover the remains of all U.S. service members from Betio Island in 1946 and 1947, but they were unable to recover Johnson's, according to a statement issued by the POW/MIA accounting agency.\nBut last June, History Flight notified the Department of Defense that it had found a burial site on Betio Island where they recovered the remains of what they believed were 35 U.S. Marines who had fought during the battle of Tarawa.\nApproximately 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors were killed during the battle and another 2,000 were wounded.\nThe military ceremony was followed by Johnson's great-grandnieces, Madeline and Emmerson Brumbaugh, ages 10 and 7, releasing doves into the sky.", "Supreme Court issues in 2016": "The Supreme Court is operating with eight justices this year following the death of Antonin Scalia in February.

He'll be replaced by his principal deputy, Ian Gershengorn, who will take over as acting solicitor general on June 25, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said. \n\"For five years, Solicitor General Don Verrilli has fought in our nation's highest court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved America forward,\" Obama said in his statement. \nHe successfully defended the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, as well as arguing in favor of gay marriage. In 2013 he led the case against the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. In 2015, he successfully argued in \nObergefell v. Hodges\n, a decision that cleared the way for gay marriage nationwide. \nThis term, he defended the President's controversial executive actions on immigration as well as arguing in support of an affirmative action plan at the University of Texas.\nThe soft-spoken Verrilli was highly respected by the justices who sometimes offered him an opportunity -- denied to other advocates -- to take a few moments at the end of his time at the podium to sum up his argument without interruption.\nIn public, Verrilli spoke passionately about the pro bono work he did as a young lawyer on behalf of death row inmates. \n\"It was these experiences more than any other that taught me what it was to be a lawyer,\" he told students at Boston University School of law in 2013. \n\"And I also came to appreciate the importance of the principle that every person deserves vigorous advocacy \" he said. \nObama nominated Verrilli to succeed Elena Kagan as solicitor general after she was sworn into the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. He was confirmed by the Senate in 2011 by a 72-16 vote.\nThe timing of Verrilli's departure is no surprise, since Obama's second term is ending and arguments before high court have ended for this term. The court has 24 cases left to decide in its current term and is expected to complete its work by the end of June. \nIn a statement, Lynch called Verrilli \"a brilliant lawyer, a devoted public servant and one of the most consequential solicitors general in American history.\"\nOther analysts agreed with the historical relevance of his five years in the post. \n\"It's hard to imagine a solicitor general who has had a more tumultuous -- and momentous -- five years than Don Verrilli,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN contributor and professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. \n\"Although he has received a lot of criticism for his positions and performances in some of the more high-profile cases he's argued on behalf of the Obama administration the results generally bely those criticisms, and I'm hard-pressed to think of a solicitor general who's navigated more complex waters with as much skill and grace as he has,\" he said.\nIn 2012, critics seized on Verrilli's performance at oral arguments in the health care case when he appeared to stumble after apparently choking on water at the start of his presentation. \nBut Verrilli was vindicated months later when Chief Justice John Roberts accepted the administration's secondary argument upholding the law under Congress' taxing power. \nPrior to his government service he was a partner at Jenner & Block where he handled numerous cases before the court including \nMGM Studios v. Grokster\n, a critical copyright case concerning the unauthorized distribution of protected works. \nVerrill graduated from Yale University and Columbia Law School and served as a clerk to Justice William J.

The law protects the gullible as well as the sophisticated. As we've seen over the course of the last year, there are a lot of people who fall for Mr. Trump's promises and rhetoric,\" Schneiderman said.\nREAD: Judge directs internal Trump University docs to be released\nTrump is \ncurrently facing three separate lawsuits\n -- two class action suits filed in California and one in New York by Schneiderman -- which argue the program that took in an estimated $40 million, but was mired in fraud and deception.\nSchneiderman's case argues that Trump and Michael Sexton, the former president of the program, engaged in fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct, and that although the program promised to offer courses taught by experts personally selected by Trump, the teachers were neither handpicked nor experts.\nSchneiderman has repeatedly lambasted Trump and his \"university,\" telling CNN's Carol Costello Tuesday on \"Newsroom\" that Trump \"defrauded people out of money. They're entitled to their day in court.\"\n\"This is a hugely important case. If you look at the facts of this case, this shows someone who was absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people, to say whatever it took to induce them into his phony seminars,\" Schneiderman told CNN. \"Telling people who are in hard economic times -- we're talking about 2008, 2009 -- people desperate to hold onto their homes, to make some money, convincing them that he will teach them his entrepreneurial secrets.\"\nSchneiderman also stressed to MSNBC that his suit was not political.\n\"We sued him in 2013. He says it's a political case. Nobody in August 2013 thought that this guy was going to be the Republican nominee for president,\" the attorney general said Thursday. \"Thousands of people were bilked out of millions of dollars. Our first priority is to get their money back and to reestablish the legitimacy of educational institutions in New York State.\"\nAnd Schneiderman was emphatic about the merits of the suit, rebutting the argument advanced by Trump that students have said they were happy with the product they received from the school.\n\"This is straight up fraud. It's like selling people a Mercedes and getting a Volkswagen. Even if people say, 'I kind of like the Volkswagen,' it's still fraud, not a Mercedes,\" Schneiderman said. \nSchneiderman also revealed that Trump -- who has loudly proclaimed he \"never settles\" cases -- had tried to seek a settlement in the case. \n\"He did offer to settle. He settles cases all the time,\" Schneiderman said, adding that as a result of \"a series of motions\" and appeals, \"I don't think we'll have a trial until after the election.\"\nTrump defended Trump University\n last week during a campaign rally in San Diego, where he attacked several of the judges involved in the case.\n\"The trial is going to take place sometime in November. There should be no trial. This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily, everybody says it. But I have judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater,\" Trump said.\n\"I could have settled this case many times, but I don't want to settle cases when we are right. I don't believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,\" Trump told the crowd.", "How the GOP lost California Latinos": "But the imperative to broaden his appeal among Latinos voters has seemed far from his mind. His California events have been disrupted by pro-immigration protesters who he belittles. He recently hurled insults at the California judge overseeing the fraud case involving Trump University, calling him a \"Trump hater\" and raising questions about his Mexican heritage. Outside his recent San Diego rally, protesters waved Mexican flags and shouted \"F--- Trump.\" \nIt is yet another reason Republicans are worried about the potential long-term damage that Trump has inflicted on the GOP's image, and their efforts to reach out to younger Latino and minority voters who will be increasingly critical with each election cycle. \nClinton's flood-the-zone Trump strategy\nThe crowds of protesters and clashes outside Trump's rallies in California have served as an eerie reminder of what happened to Republicans here in California after they got behind Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure that would have barred immigrants from getting basic state services.\nCalifornia was still recovering from the depths of recession, and the measure passed overwhelmingly, but ultimately was struck down by the courts. \nMore lasting was the perception it created among many California voters: that the GOP was anti-Latino. Their embrace of the measure is often cited as one of the central reasons for the steep decline of registered Republicans in California over several decades.\nRepublicans for Hillary?\nRepublican presidential candidates won the Golden State every cycle from 1968 until 1988, during which time California Republicans Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were each elected twice to the White House. Bill Clinton broke the GOP's California winning streak in 1992 in his three-way race with George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot. The state has only gotten more blue in the years since.\nTrump has said he can win in California even though, in his words, \"other GOP candidates wouldn't even come here for a dinner.\"\nBut this November many Republican candidates for House, Senate and local races will have to decide whether to stand with Trump on his plans to build a wall and deport 11 million immigrants without papers. \nSome see a cautionary tale in the course that California Governor Pete Wilson took in 1994. He was a moderate Republican with mainstream appeal -- but that image changed when he got behind Proposition 187 to save his 1994 re-election campaign.  \nWhen Trump hits back, he hits back hard\nThe strategy worked for him in the short term, but it hurt the image of his party for many years to come. When Wilson was running in the fall of 1994, Republicans made up 37% of registered voters. Today they make up just 27.5% of voters here -- and could soon be overtaken by those who decline to state a party preference. \nTrump's approval ratings among Latinos could be key to wins or losses in swing states like Colorado and Nevada. But in a recent Fox Latino poll 74% of Latinos said they viewed Trump unfavorably.\nEven with that data, the candidate has given no indication that he intends to strike a more inclusive tone, predicting instead that Latinos will ultimately warm to his candidacy. \n\"I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump when I give all these jobs,\" Trump said at his recent rally in San Diego, which drew hundreds of protesters. \"I think they are going to love it. I think they are going to love me.\"", "First he fought in Iraq, now he could battle Trump, Clinton": "In fact, he backed it so strongly that he decided to enlist and serve there.\nHe has also staked out controversial national security positions ranging from prohibiting women from serving in combat roles to defending the European knights who went on crusades in the Middle Ages against \"Muslim jihadists\" -- and has sharply condemned Donald Trump for some of the presumptive GOP nominee's policy prescriptions.\nFrench, who conservative intellectual and Weekly Standard magazine editor Bill Kristol is looking to as a challenger for Trump, said he felt it was his moral obligation to enlist in the Iraq fight.\nWriting two years ago in the National Review, a publication he still works for, \nFrench detailed his rationale \nfor joining the military at 36 years of age.\nHe said he made the decision in 2005 after reading a series of articles about the war. \"It was 2005, and the war was going badly,\" he wrote.\nFrench added that in particular it was a story focusing on a wounded American officer, about his age, with a family that compelled him to take action.\n\"That's when my conscience stopped me cold,\" French wrote. \"America wasn't too soft to fight a long war. I was too soft. And I had no excuse ... So I enlisted.\" \nIf he does decide to make a long-shot independent bid for the White House, French would also stand out for his military service.\nTrump \nreceived education and medical deferments\n that prevented his being drafted during the Vietnam War, while Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders \napplied for conscientious objector status\n during the same period. Sanders' application was denied, but by that time he was too old to be drafted. Hillary Clinton, who is on track to receive the Democratic nomination, has claimed that her attempt to enlist in the United States Marine Corps in 1975 \nwas rebuffed by a recruiter\n.\nKristol confirmed to CNN special correspondent Jamie Gangel on Tuesday that his search for an alternative to Trump and Clinton has zeroed in on the largely unknown French.\nFrench, who is also a constitutional lawyer, has not confirmed that he is considering a third-party campaign but took to Twitter Tuesday after word of a possible run circulated to write: \"All the normal political rules apply. The conventional wisdom has been right. An underdog can't win. Right?\"\nOn Wednesday night, French's wife, Nancy, tweeted that her husband \"is in Vermont thinking and praying\" and she included a video clip from \"Lord of the Rings.\"\nAccording to French's official record with the Department of Defense, his military career was as follows:\nFrench joined the Army in 2006, being appointed as a 1st lieutenant into the U.S. Army Reserve. He was part of the Judge Advocate General Corps, the Army's legal branch.\nAs an Army reservist, French was deployed to Iraq from November 2007 to September 2008. While there he was assigned as the squadron judge advocate, legal advisor. His service in Iraq earned him the Bronze Star, among other awards. \nHe was promoted to the rank of major in 2013 with his reserve obligation ending in April 2014, after which he transferred to the Inactive Ready Reserve.\nAt National Review, French has written extensively on military and national security issues.\nIn May, shortly after President Barack Obama's visit to Hiroshima, French called America's decision to use atomic bombs in World War II \"perhaps the most critical -- and wisest decision -- of any American commander-in-chief in our history.\"\nDuring the debate over whether to declassify the 28 pages of a report pertaining to the role of Saudi Arabia and Saudi nationals in the 9/11 attacks, French said, \"My general philosophy of the Middle East is simple -- however bad you think the place is, in reality it's far worse. Even our 'allies' will constantly surprise even the most hardened cynic with their mendacity and double-dealing.\"\nHe is a staunch opponent of allowing women to take on combat roles in the military, writing in September, \"If you integrate infantry units by gender, more Americans will die, and our enemy will have a better chance to prevail on the battlefield.\"\nFrench also slammed Trump in March, shortly after the presumptive Republican nominee suggested he would allow the torture of terrorists and the intentional targeting of their families.\nFrench tweeted, \"Not one person I served with in Iraq would kill a mother and child on order. Not one. It's murder, plain and simple.\"\nHe has condemned Obama's decision to withdraw from Iraq in 2011, calling it an \"unpardonable sin,\" but credited the President with not abandoning Iraq entirely by authorizing anti-ISIS airstrikes -- yet still criticized this \"incremental\" approach.\nFrench has called for much more robust military intervention against ISIS, saying that the U.S. should arm the Kurds and that American ground troops should be deployed if they were needed to rout ISIS from Mosul.\n\"It's time for the world to see ISIS fighters flee for their lives. It's time for the world to see ISIS flags in flames, stomped on in the streets. Slow-motion warfare has to end,\" \nhe wrote in the National Review.\nHe has also taken on historical military campaigns, at one point defending the Medieval crusades. He wrote that they were launched as a defensive measure to protect Christian kingdoms against \"Muslim jihadists.\" \nHe concluded that article by saying, \"We owe the Christian knights of Western Europe a great debt. It's time we recognized them as heroes.\"", "Clinton's flood-the-zone Trump strategy": "The likely Democratic presidential nominee is attempting to take down Trump by zeroing in on individual issues, starting with housing and \nveterans' care\n, and hitting their Republican foe with coordinated attacks. \nClinton's campaign is making the candidate more readily available for interviews, with Clinton borrowing a Trump tactic and calling into television news programs -- \nlike CNN's \"The Lead\" for an interview with Jake Tapper on Tuesday\n -- this time, to attack her rival for a months-long delay in divvying up nearly $6 million in charitable contributions to veterans' organizations. \n\"Look, I'm glad he finally did it, but I don't know that he should get much credit,\" Clinton told Tapper. \"I think the problem here is the difference between what Donald Trump says and what Donald Trump does.\"\nRELATED: Clinton: Trump shamed into making donations to veterans groups\nHer campaign \nis also dispatching an army of surrogates to hit Trump in battleground states\n and on conference calls with reporters. The goal: Chip into Trump's dominance of the day's news cycle and deepen concerns about his temperament. \nThose concerns could be a key advantage for Clinton over Trump: \nAn ABC/Washington Post poll\n in May found that 61% of voters say Clinton has a better personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, compared to 31% for Trump. \nTuesday's effort focused on Trump and veterans. The Clinton campaign hammered Trump's record on veterans in a national press conference call, and in calls and interviews in battleground states, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado and New Hampshire. \nThose surrogates hit Trump over his questioning of Arizona Sen. John McCain's war hero status, accused him of scamming veterans through his scandal-plagued Trump University and lambasted him for failing to support the latest version of the post-9/11 GI Bill. \n\"Donald Trump has never spent one minute of the kind of service that Sen. McCain has served for his country. So for him to disparage that service is despicable and disgraceful,\" said John Douglass, a retired Air Force brigadier general, on a conference call featuring Florida veterans hosted by the Clinton campaign Tuesday.\nRELATED: First on CNN: Clinton campaign's plans to subvert Trump's veterans press conference\nThat push came on the heels of the Clinton camp's effort last week to knock Trump off-message and discredit the presumptive Republican nominee by hammering him over a series of comments he made about the 2008 financial crisis.\nAs for the effectiveness of Clinton's new strategy, the early results are mixed. \nAhead of Trump's planned news conference Tuesday detailing his $5.6 million in charitable contributions divvied up among veterans' organizations, Clinton's campaign was well-prepared to highlight Trump's past disparaging remarks about veterans, his Veterans Administration reform plans, and his months-long refusal to fully account for the funds he raised in January for veterans' charities. \nTrump, meanwhile, turned his news conference into a battle with the political press -- he attacked an ABC News reporter as \"a sleaze\" -- and political reporters overall as \"among the most dishonest people that I have ever met.\" \nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon told The Washington Post that her campaign can win news cycles on the local and state levels -- even if Trump remains the star of national newscasts. Fallon said Trump's wall-to-wall coverage might not prove helpful, anyway. \n\"He is definitely taking the approach that all publicity is good publicity. But he commands the news coverage because of his willingness to traffic in offensive statements, demeaning and insulting comments, and outrageous conspiracy theories,\" Fallon said. \"That is a recipe for commanding attention. But it is not a strategy for making inroads with the key voter groups he needs in order to improve his standing for the general election.\" ", "Garland returns to alma mater for commencement": "Garland spoke to the graduates about their futures and potential life changes ahead.

You'll have a much more fulfilling life by turning your focus outwards, to helping others.\"\nThe high school graduation speech -- touted by the White House in its ongoing bid to get Garland confirmed, was strikingly different in tone than his address 46 years earlier. Garland, then headed off to Harvard, expressed support for a fellow commencement speaker's right to voice opinions about the war in Vietnam and other political topics. \nPresident Obama referred to that speech when he nominated Garland in mid-March, saying that although \"Merrick didn't necessarily agree with the tone of his classmate's remarks, nor his choice of topic for that day\" it led the now-judge to toss \"aside his prepared remarks and delivered instead, on the spot, a passionate, impromptu defense of our First Amendment rights.\"\nPublic statements by Supreme Court nominees are rare.

Whitman is a veteran in the Pentagon's public affairs office and has been a top spokesman on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\"It's a personnel matter we are not going to be able to comment,\" Pentagon deputy press secretary Gordon Trowbridge told CNN Wednesday. Whitman has not been reassigned duties, he said. Trowbridge declined to state if Whitman will be at work in the future.\nWhitman's lawyer, Danny Onorato, declined comment Thursday.\nCourt records show that three charges of second degree theft were filed against Whitman and that, on Tuesday, he entered into the plea agreement which also mandates he stay away from the neighbor and the nanny. An incident report obtained by CNN showed the Capitol Hill resident reported that her nanny's rear license plates were stolen April 21.

The Vermont senator, who has used a bus to traverse the state, headlined over 27 rallies and forums last month, and is expected to have a jam packed schedule the week before Tuesday's primary.\nClinton had planned to campaign this week in New Jersey ahead of that state's Tuesday primary, but the campaign decided instead to fly to San Diego for a speech on foreign policy that will also go directly after Trump, as well as tout her own experience as secretary of state. \nFirst he fought in Iraq, now he could battle Trump, Clinton\nClinton will argue that the choice in 2016 \"goes beyond partisanship\" because Trump is \"unlike any presidential nominee we've seen in modern times and he is fundamentally unfit for the job,\" Jake Sullivan, Clinton's senior policy adviser, said in a statement.\nThe speech shows the predicament Clinton is currently in: She is committing five days to battle Sanders in California, a solidly Democratic general election state, while also trying to focus on the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\"I wonder why Secretary Clinton and her husband Bill are back in California,\" Sanders sarcastically told reporters Wednesday in Spreckels, California. \"I thought we had lost it. It was all over but I guess Secretary Clinton maybe is looking at some polling would suggest otherwise.\"\nDonald Trump's obsession with himself\nThe non-stop campaigning -- coupled with a small ad buy, dozens of surrogate events and targeted get out the vote efforts -- is more than Clinton's senior aides expected to commit to California months ago.\nAides acknowledge Clinton could lose the state, despite polls showing her up narrowly. Internal polling has Clinton up double digits in New Jersey, aides said, and their thinking is that it \"doesn't make sense\" to be in the Garden State while the race in California is still \"tight.\"\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll released Wednesday found the race \nneck-and-neck\n, with Clinton holding a 2 point lead over Sanders, 49% to 47%.\n\"Clearly California is a big state and I am going to do everything I can to meet as many voters as possible,\" Clinton told CNN on Tuesday. \"I was proud today to be endorsed by Gov. Jerry Brown and we are going to keep working as diligently and tirelessly as we can to get as much voters to turn out and vote for me next Tuesday.\"\nBrown, the Democratic governor, endorsed Clinton this week\n, arguing she has the best chance to beat Trump in the fall. Sanders replied that Brown, who challenged Bill Clinton for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination, is part of the establishment backing the front-runner. \n\"I will tell you that in every state that we have gone into, we have taken on the entire Democratic establishment,\" Sanders said in response to a question about Brown's endorsement. \"It's not surprising to me that, you know, we will have the Democratic establishment supporting Hillary Clinton.\"\nSanders fights superdelegate system\nAt the same time, the former secretary of state doesn't need to win California \u2014 or even come that close \u2014 to win the nomination on Tuesday. \nClinton currently needs 70 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination, according to CNN's estimate, a number she is likely to win from the New Jersey primary. Because results from New Jersey will come in hours before California, top aides assume that most news networks will call the Democratic Primary on Tuesday before results come in from the West Coast. And since delegates are awarded proportionally \u2014 this isn't winner-take-all as some of the big GOP contests were -- a Sanders win in California wouldn't make a much of a dent in her lead.\nTrump unleashes on Clinton after day of attacks\nBut Clinton aides said they were aware that losing California to Sanders would be embarrassing for her campaign and could hand the Vermont senator the needed momentum to justify staying in the race through Democratic convention in July.\nSanders has continued to rail on the superdelegate system throughout California, blasting the \"Democratic establishment\" for allowing Democratic elected officials and party insiders to have a vote in who the party nominates.\n\"It is a pretty dumb system,\" Sanders said in Monterey, California on Tuesday about the fact so many party insiders are behind Clinton. \"It's an unfair system, it's a dumb system, and it's a system we will change.\"\nBut Sanders, with a win in California, hopes he will be able to turn the system to his advantage. Sanders and his aides have argued for weeks that a win in California will help the Vermont senator convince super delegates currently backing Clinton to support him instead.\nSo far, though, the effort has been largely fruitless: Clinton has maintained a sizeable superdelegate lead and Sanders has only been able to flip one delegate.\nClinton IT staffer intends to take the Fifth in upcoming deposition\nIn an attempt to lower the stakes in California, the Clinton campaign has instructed surrogates to say that they \"expect\" California to be a close contest, but to downplay its importance in picking the eventual nominee.\n\"Even if Senator Sanders wins each of the remaining contests by 32 points, Hillary Clinton will still have earned the majority of pledged delegates and popular vote,\" read talking points distributed to supporters on Tuesday.\nClinton will continue to largely ignore Sanders in California, aides said, a tactic Clinton employed in late May during a string of events in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.\nClinton, instead, will focus almost exclusively on Trump, casting him as a \"fraud,\" as she did in New Jersey on Wednesday. After \nworkshopping different ways to take on Trump\n, Clinton and her aides have landed on trying to discredit him early as a businessman who only protects his own interests, a man who is incapable of working with others and a candidate who would pose a risk to national security.\nHer speech Thursday will begin drawing from her record as secretary of state, defending what some Republicans have said will be a liability for her in a race against Trump.\nHillary Clinton has $42 million in the bank, campaign raised $27 million in May\n\"She will reflect on her experience making the tough calls and doing the hard work of protecting our country,\" Sullivan said. \"She'll reaffirm her conviction that strong, principled American leadership makes both the United States and the world more secure.\"\nSullivan added: \"And you will hear in her speech a confidence in America and our capacity to overcome the challenges we face while staying true to our values -- a strong contrast to Donald Trump's incessant trash-talking of America.\"\nSanders, however, is expected to continue to draw contrast with Clinton as primary day in California gets closer. He spent Wednesday hitting Clinton for opposing an outright ban on hydraulic fracturing, a controversial drilling tactic.\n\"Sec. Clinton does not support a ban on fracking,\" Sanders tweeted on Wednesday. \"Instead, she would simply impose a few more regulations on it.

His latest run-in with Mexicans came as he pointedly noted the ethnicity of the judge presiding over a\n lawsuit \nrelated to Trump University.\nDuring a campaign stump where he demanded the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, \nrecuse himself\n, Trump said that the judge -- who is of Mexican heritage but was born in Indiana -- was a \"Mexican.\" He then added, \"I think that's fine.\" \nScots rule Donald Trump out of bounds\nLongtime host\nThe World Golf Championship tournament -- a top-tier event second only in prominence to the sport's four annual majors -- has been held at Miami's Doral resort since the 1960s, but will be moved to the Mexican capital in 2017, to a course to be confirmed, and renamed the WGC-Mexico Championship.\nPGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem insisted that the decision was a financial one, and not related to Trumps' political ambitions. \n\"Some of the reaction revolves around the feeling that this is political exercise, and it is not that in any way, shape or form,'' Finchem \nsaid\n during a press conference. \n\"The decision here was based on the reality that we are not able to secure sponsorship for next year's WGC at Doral or for years out for that matter.\"\nThe Donald Trump guide to the rest of the world\nPlayer support\nAt least some of the tour players seemed to be on board with relocating the Championship event. \"We've been at Doral (since 1962), and it's been a special place for the PGA Tour,\" former Doral winner Phil Mickelson \nsaid\n. \n\"But it does offer an opportunity to take a World Golf Championship outside the United States and bring world-class golf to Mexico City.\"\nRory McIlroy, the Northern Irish four-time major winner, also supported the move saying: \"They're called 'World' Golf Championships for a reason,\" alluding to the U.S.-centric nature of the series. \nAfter being dropped by automotive maker Cadillac, the event will now be sponsored by Grupo Salinas, a retail, media and communications conglomerate based in Mexico City. \nFinchem did add that relocating the event would present a vital opportunity in a growth market for the American golf body. \n\"At the same time, we had an opportunity to build what we think is going to be a spectacular event in an area that is strategically important to the growth of the sport and the activity of the PGA Tour that has been focused in South America and Central America for the last good number of years.''\nSawgrass: 12 of the best par-3s on the planet\n'Gracious' host\nThe commissioner took a conciliatory tone with the brash candidate, insisting that Trump had been a \"most gracious host\" since taking over the property in 2012 and was \"committed\" to renovating the famous Blue Monster course, upon which the event is held.\n\"The PGA Tour has had a wonderful history in greater Miami and at Trump National Doral and we remain interested in returning when the time is right,\" Finchem added.\nHowever, he appeared to later concede that Doral's owner's personality may have made it difficult to find new sponsorship.\n\"Donald Trump is a brand -- a big brand -- and when you are asking a [sponsor] to invest millions of dollars in branding a tournament and they're going to share that brand with a host... it's a difficult conversation,\" the Washington Post \nreported\n him as saying. \n\"The politics may have contributed some since he's been running.\"\nOthers were more unrestrained with their political observations. \n\"It's quite ironic that we're going to Mexico after being at Doral,\" McIlroy said. \"We just jump over the wall.\"\nHow $67 million failed to stop Trump", "Obama dives into 2016 fight, lambasts GOP on economy": "Without mentioning any presidential candidates by name -- Democrat or Republican -- Obama lambasted what he said were economic myths peddled by the GOP, insisting any clear-eyed assessment shows the country better off now then when he took office.\nSpeaking in Elkhart, Indiana, a city he frequented at the beginning of his term as he worked to stave off an economic depression, Obama listed every major economic achievement of his presidency, from expanding overtime rules to tightening regulations on big banks.\nAnd while he made clear, specific references to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Obama steered away from lauding the economic plans being offered by the two Democrats vying for the party's nomination.\n\"If we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of 'okey-doke,' just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative, then we're not going to build on the progress we started,\" Obama said. \"If we get cynical and just vote our fears, or if we don't vote at all, we won't build on the progress that we started.\"\nDuring his hour-long remarks, Obama cast the upcoming general election as a choice between his own policies and those that would only benefit wealthy Americans. But because the Democratic primary race is still being fought between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Obama avoided making any specific case for a candidate that would carry on his agenda.\nClinton is all but assured to secure the Democratic nomination, and it's little secret that Obama regards his former secretary of state as the natural heir to his presidency. But on Wednesday, the only mention of the word \"Clinton\" during his speech came when he lauded lower deficits during President Bill Clinton's presidency.\nInstead, Obama spoke in broader terms about the upcoming vote.\n\"If what you care about in this election is your pocketbook, if what you're concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class, if that's what you're concerned about -- the economy -- the debate is not even close,\" Obama said, at one point calling Trump's proposal to eliminate new banking regulations \"crazy.\"\n\"I don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent. Why would you do that? Less oversight on Wall Street would only make another crisis more likely,\" Obama said. \"How can you say you're for the middle class and then you want to tear down these rules?\"\n\"Don't think that actually this agenda is going to help you,\" Obama continued. \"It's not designed to help you. And the evidence of the last 30 years, not to mention common sense, should tell you their answers to our challenges are no answers at all.\"\nAhead of his remarks Wednesday, a White House source said Obama was chomping at the bit to get out and \"get people fired up\" about the upcoming election, though the source conceded Obama will remain largely on the sidelines until the Democrats have a nominee.\nObama expects to \"explode onto the scene\" once the nominee is selected and \"knows his power\" to fire up the Democratic base, the source said.\n\"It's driving him crazy\" to be mostly hands-off, the source added.\nIn his speech, Obama used his strongest language this year to push back against GOP proposals.\n\"In today's economy, we can't put up walls around America. We're not going to round up 11 million people, we're not going to put technology back in the box, we're not going to rip away hard-earned rights for women and minorities and Americans with disabilities,\" Obama said. \"These are permanent fixtures in our economy and rolling them back will not help folks in Elkhart or anywhere else.\"\nLater, Obama claimed a Republican president would \"lead to lower wages, it would eliminate worker protections, it would cut investments in things like education, it would weaken the safety net, it would kick people off health insurance, it would let China write the rules for the global economy, it would let big oil write the rules that protect our air and water, it would let big banks weaken rules that protect families from getting cheated, it would cut taxes for wealthy Americans to historic lows.\"\nObama was returning to Concord Community High School -- the site of his first major trip as President -- to a town that has dramatically recovered from the recession. Since Obama's first speech there, Elkhart's unemployment rate has dropped from 19.6% to 4.1% today, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Manufacturing and graduation rates in Elkhart have also significantly improved from 2009.\nIn a statement, Michael Short a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said Obama was \"trying to convince voters his record of weak growth, stagnant wages and a shrinking middle class is really a success story.\"\n\"The fact that there are 264,000 fewer manufacturing jobs today than when President Obama took office more than seven years ago is a stark reminder of the failure of his policies,\" Short said.\nIn his final year in office, Obama has been returning to sites in the U.S. with significance for his presidential tenure. In February, he visited Springfield, Illinois, where he first announced in 2007 he was running for the White House.", "Jon Stewart on Trump: 'He is a man-baby'": "\"He is a man-baby,\" Stewart told David Axelrod during a live taping of \"The Axe Files,\" a podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \"He has the physical countenance of a man and a baby's temperament and hands. ... (Vanity Fair editor) Graydon Carter did \na joke about Donald Trump's hands\n 25 years ago, he's still not f---ing over it.\"\nIf Trump really wants to engage a politically incorrect debate, Stewart said, he should tell voters, \"The problems in this country are not because of Mexicans and Muslims.\" \nStewart also talked about Trump's likely opponent this fall, Democrat \nHillary Clinton\n.\nHe described the former secretary of state as \"a very bright woman without the courage of her convictions.\"\n\"That's not to say that she is not preferable to Donald Trump,\" he added, \"because at this point I would vote for Mr. T over Donald Trump.\"\nOpinion: Donald Trump is a huge embarrassment for America\nStewart pinned some of the blame for Trump's rise on what he described as the failure of Democrats to transform the public sector into a more dynamic actor. \n\"The door is open to an a--hole like Donald Trump because the Democrats haven't done enough to show people that government, that can be effective for people, can be efficient for people,\" he said. \"And if you can't do that, then you've lost the right to make that change and someone's going to come in and demagogue you.\" \nOpinion: How a delusional GOP lifted up Trump\nStewart also took aim at the political class, asking, \"Why are we so good at campaigns and so bad at governance?\"\n\"The government we have is hard to move,\" Axelrod responded, defending his former client and boss President Barack Obama and the current administration. \"We moved a lot in the first two years when Obama was president.\"", "Bernie or bust: Sanders supporters vow to hold out": "\"When you say Bernie or bust, that means if we don't get Bernie, we're just not going to automatically vote for the demon because you're saying the devil may be there,\" said Billy Taylor, who is organizing a coalition of Bernie Sanders supporters to protest at the Democratic convention here in July.\nSanders has inspired a movement, but it's unclear whether he can control it. Or if he wants to.\nAfter the final wave of states vote next Tuesday, Sanders has one decision to make. His supporters have another. And many insist they will not fall into line behind Hillary Clinton.\n\"You can't expose the corruption of the political system and then expect us to get behind that same political system,\" said Gary Frazier, a leader of a group called Black Men for Bernie, who is also organizing Sanders supporters here in Philadelphia.\nIn interviews here this week, Frazier and Taylor outlined their plans to CNN, imploring Sanders' supporters to leave the Democratic Party to protest rules governing the presidential nominating system. They are taking seriously Sanders' call for a political revolution, complicating any hope for quick unity with Clinton.\n\"We are prepared to de-register from the Democratic Party and explore other options. Maybe we don't get it done in this election, but I can damn well guarantee you this: We mean business,\" Frazier said. \"If Bernie Sanders does not walk out of that thing as the nominee, we can guarantee you from that point on we'll start the de-registration of the Democratic Party. They have a choice to make.\"\nTheir passion doesn't change the hard reality of the delegate math: Clinton will clinch the party's nomination next Tuesday. Sanders will not.\nYet Sanders' most loyal supporters are now convinced the system is rigged, setting up a collision course for Democrats. He has done little to dissuade them.\n\"It's an unfair system, it's a dumb system, and it's a system we will change,\" Sanders said in California, rallying supporters through comments that have fueled deep skepticism about party rules.\nThe support for Sanders is not built on the party faithful alone.\nCNN exit polls from 27 states that have voted this year show that 63% of Sanders' supporters are Democrats and 33% are independents or from another party. It's a far cry from Clinton, whose supporters are 85% Democrat and only 13% independent or from another party.\nClinton needs some of those independents to win, which is why winning over those Sanders supporters is critical to her campaign.\n\"He said the other day he'll do everything possible to defeat Donald Trump,\" Clinton told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. \"I take him at his word. The threat he poses the country and democracy and economy, I certainly expect Senator Sanders to do what he said he would.\"\nThe Clinton campaign is also counting on Trump to serve as a unifying force to the party, which is a miscalculation in the minds of Taylor and Frazier.\n\"If we don't go along with Hillary, then Trump's going to get the presidency and the world's going to be in shambles,\" Frazier said. \"That's 'BS' to us.\"\nA Quinnipiac poll Wednesday found that 75% of Sanders supporters said they would rally behind Clinton in a race with Trump, but about a quarter of his supporters went elsewhere. It's an open question whether the campaign's heat of the moment will fade or give way to party unity.\nSara Alicia Huerta Long, who traveled to New Jersey from Michigan to volunteer for the Sanders campaign, said she believed the \"Bernie or Bust\" movement had considerable support and Clinton would struggle to win over Sanders' supporters.\n\"There's a lot of first time voters who've only come out to vote for him,\" Long said in an interview, \"and they don't want her.\"", "Rubio: I apologized to Trump for 'small hands' jest": "Meditating on everything from Trump's rise to his fractious relationship with Jeb Bush, Rubio revisited nearly every turn of his presidential run in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" The former presidential candidate, who has grudgingly said he will support Trump in November, also admitted a series of mistakes that he says eventually bedeviled his campaign.\nChief among those, Rubio has said, was belittling Trump for the size of his hands in the leadup to Super Tuesday, which he has publicly said he regrets. But Rubio went further when speaking with Tapper.\n\"I actually told Donald -- one of the debates, I forget which one -- I apologized to him for that,\" Rubio said. \"I said, 'You know, I'm sorry that I said that. It's not who I am and I shouldn't have done it.' I didn't say it in front of the cameras, I didn't want any political benefit.\"\nRubio, who told Tapper that he would be willing to speak on Trump's behalf at the convention, did signal some respect for the man he has sharply criticized, praising him as \"the ultimate change agent\" and that he may be developing \"perhaps a more comprehensive approach\" on some policy questions.\nRubio recommended that Trump not drastically alter his approach in the general election.\n\"I don't think he should change if he's been successful,\" Rubio said when asked about Trump dredging up scandals of the 1990s to attack Hillary Clinton, which Rubio said he himself wouldn't do. \"I may not like that direction, but at this point, he won and this is the direction that he won on.\"\nRubio also offered an assessment of his own political stumbles during his year as a presidential candidate. The Florida senator said his fundamental problem was that he \"didn't have a logical political base on which to build,\" given former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's supremacy in Florida, especially among donors. That caused Rubio to spend an inordinate amount of time on private fundraising visits, he said.\nThe result was that Rubio was frequently criticized during the primary season for his light footprint in several primary states, including Iowa, where he finished a surprisingly strong third.\n\"The argument is, should we have picked a couple of states and said here's where we're going to lay a marker and win? Sure. That sounds great in hindsight,\" he said. \"Here's the reality: If I had said that about Iowa and finished in third, that would have been the last night of my campaign.\"\nRubio then hoped to finish second in New Hampshire, but was derailed by a disastrous debate performance at the hands of Chris Christie, who mocked him for clinging to memorized sound bites.\n\"I walked right into that trap,\" Rubio said.\nHad he finished second in the Granite State, Rubio said he believed he could've earned gold South Carolina.\nYet the governor that Rubio had the most complicated relationship with was Bush, his political mentor. The pair memorably clashed in a fall debate when Rubio beat back a Bush attack on his less-than-stellar Senate attendance record.\nRELATED: Rubio: I'd 'maybe' run for re-election if my friend wasn't\nBush did not endorse Rubio before the Florida primary, in which Rubio was pummeled and caused him to immediately end his bid. Rubio called the two weeks between Super Tuesday and the Florida primary on March 15 -- when he was consistently being asked about the demise of his White House hopes -- as the \"toughest part of the campaign.\"\n\"The negativity about our progress was so bad that a lot of voters, I think, concluded, you know, he's not going to win, Trump is going to win,\" Rubio told Tapper. \"And that momentum really impacted Florida. I'm not sure there was anything we could have done at that stage about it, to change that trajectory.\"\nRELATED: Rubio says he's going to the GOP convention\nRubio said that he and Bush have spoken a few times since the campaign concluded.\nAs for what's next -- assuming Rubio does not re-enter the race for his current Senate seat -- the Florida senator again ruled out running for governor of the state in two years and reaffirmed his dream of serving as commissioner of the NFL. But Rubio said he expects to work in the private sector in some capacity.\n\"I'll learn from this,\" he said of his campaign, \"and whether I run for president again one day or run for something else or do this in the business world, there are lessons I will take from this that will make me stronger and better as a result.\"", "Secret Service rushes stage to protect Sanders for second time in a week": "Toward the top of his speech at the Modesto Centre Plaza, several protesters interrupted the Vermont senator with loud chants, including two men who unfurled a black banner from an elevated riser to the left of the stage that read, \"Animal Liberation is Social Justice.\"\nA man and a woman stood near the front of the barricade with small signs reading, \"Until Every Animal is Free.\" They were both escorted out.\nTwo United States Secret Service agents jumped up on the podium to protect the senator, who stopped speaking momentarily.\nThe battle for California: Clinton, Sanders barnstorm the Golden State\nSanders supporters booed the protesters, and someone in the crowd pulled down the banner -- and with it, one of the protesters. Meanwhile, the crowd chanted, \"Bernie, Bernie.\"\nThe incident lasted only a few minutes and the senator was never in evident danger. When the protesters were removed, he said, \"As I was saying, what the American people are tired of, is large multinational corporations and Wall Street and the corporate media are exercising unbelievable power over the political and economic life of this country.\"\nHe continued, \"By the way, what things like that are about is the understanding that that is what the media will focus on. That's why guys do it. I understand that.

Kagan burst into laughter.\n\"I'm glad I didn't write that one,\" she said, dodging his comments.  \nSitting justices aren't publicly addressing the remaining cases with the same candor as Stevens.\nDown a justice, John Roberts looks to find compromise, avoid 4-4 ties\nBut how the justices might decide some of the close cases with a divided eight-member court is a theme in a term that has been turned upside down by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans are refusing to take up the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to replace Scalia, meaning the court will be evenly divided among the four liberal and conservative-leaning justices for the foreseeable future.\nOutstanding cases on the court's docket include a challenge to a Texas abortion law that critics say is one of the most strict nationwide as well as a challenge to the president's controversial executive actions on immigration. The court will also decide an affirmative action case but only seven justices will vote on that. Scalia died after oral arguments and Kagan is recused from the case presumably because she dealt with it in her previous job as Solicitor General. \nBehind closed doors, the justices are dealing with a handful cases and among the options in a very small number of them is to either divide 4-4 (which automatically upholds the lower court opinion) or to find an area of consensus to rule narrowly and duck a broad opinion. \nSo far the term has shown examples of each. For instance, in an important case concerning public sector unions, the justices simply issued a one-sentence order noting they were evenly divided. It was an unexpected win for liberals when the lower court ruling in their favor was upheld. But it also meant the Supreme Court had decided nothing and no precedent was set.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told an audience last week that she felt that only having eight justices was harmful to the court. She pointed to the \npublic unions case\n -- Friedrichs v. California Teachers --- and said the case was one of the \"most closely watched\" cases of the term but had ended with no opinion from the justices. \"An equal division is essentially the same as a denial of review\" she said and noted that the precedent underlying the case had survived another day \"at least until the court numbers nine.\"\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: 8 is not a good number\nAlthough it looked like the justices were headed for a 4-4 split in another case concerning the \nAfffordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate\n, the justices did something different. The case was a challenge brought by religious non-profit groups who objected to providing contraceptives under the law. The justices \nducked a broad opinion\n and sent the case back down to the lower court instructing the parties to look for a compromise. \nIn her remarks, Ginsburg noted that the headline case had been resolved \"without an opinion on the merits.\"\nIt's the new reality in an eight-member court that is often unanimous but judged largely by a handful of contentious cases each term. \nAlthough the justices are avoiding controversial comments in public appearances, they have referenced the debate.\nChief Justice John Roberts was careful in his comments last week before the 4th Circuit Judicial Conference when he said: \"I try to achieve as much consensus as I can, again that's not something I can do on my own,\" he said in the event covered by C-SPAN.\nJustice Steven Breyer downplayed the impact of an eight-member court.\n\"We're unanimous 50% of the time,\" he said at the annual Burton Awards ceremony held at the Library of Congress. \"And 20% of the time, we're 5-4 and about half of those are sort of random -- you know not what the press would call the usual suspects.\"\nLaw professor Barry P. McDonald, a professor at Pepperdine School of Law, opined in The New York Times recently that an eight-member court, while not representing a \"permanent fix,\" should not \"overly trouble us either.\"\n\"An evenly divided court may prompt the justices to reach practical compromises that assist real-life litigants, instead of making bold, sweeping and highly debatable proclamations about the meaning of the Constitution,\" he wrote.\nBut Elizabeth Wydra, of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, is troubled by an eight-member court and has been urging the Senate to  confirm Garland. While she agrees there are times when the court may prefer to issue a narrow consensus ruling, she says, \"That doesn't mean that the court should punt on important legal questions simply because there is not a fully staffed court capable of setting national precedent and resolving profoundly important legal disputes.\"\nAnd although Breyer points to only a small number of cases that could be close, she said those cases are often the most important.\n\"It is hard to be sanguine about a potential 4-4 deadlock if you are a woman whose right to reproductive choice is at stake, or you are an immigrant whose ability to stay with your family is at risk,\" she said, referencing two of the pending cases.  \nIn his comments, Breyer addressed neither case, but left his audience dangling.\n\"We may divide 4-4 in four to five cases, we may not,\" he said.", "Checking Trump's argument against releasing his taxes": "", "Trump throws tantrum after media does its job": "The truth of the matter is that reporters have very good reasons to take Trump's claims with a grain of salt -- and to ignore the name-calling, mockery and insults he uses to try and distract journalists from double-checking nearly everything he says. \nTrump routinely and repeatedly says many, many things that are simply untrue. Not only were members of the press justified in skeptically asking Trump to prove he made the donations he'd boasted about, they -- we -- are especially required to verify any of the candidate's assertions, because they so often turn out to be at odds with the facts.  \nIn the case at hand, Trump made a big deal of his claims -- announced on national television in January -- that he had raised $6 million to donate to veterans organizations, including $1 million of his own money. That turned out to be not quite true: Trump only coughed up the million on May 24 -- months after his promise -- on the same day that \nsharp-eyed Washington Post reporters\n called to find out if and when the donation had occurred. \n\"The press should be ashamed of itself,\" \nTrump said at his press conference\n. \"You make me look bad.\"\nQuite the contrary: The press should be proud of the work it did. \nMore than a dozen of the veterans organizations funded by Trump told The Washington Post they only got their money last week, several in the form of checks via overnight mail on the day the Post pressed Trump to explain where \nthe long-delayed donations were\n. If reporters hadn't asked, it's unclear when or whether the groups would have seen any of the money Trump promised. \nCynics might say that Trump's no different from other candidates, and that all politicians tell lies. That may be. But the size, frequency and brazenness of Trump's are so off the charts that they have drawn considerable commentary. \n\"The thing about Trump is that he's so blas\u00e9 about lying, and does it so frequently, that people tend to forget how many made-up facts they've heard from him,\" \nwrote Rob Garver,\n a longtime Washington-based reporter, in The Fiscal Times. \nRemember that this is the candidate who peddled -- and \nto this day has not renounced\n -- garbage claims that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and then never produced any evidence.  \nTrump is also the candidate who falsely said: \"I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.\"\nNot true\n. \nNo news organization\n or elected official ever confirmed Trump's account, which he has never renounced. This is the same candidate who\n mocked a disabled reporter\n, Serge Kovaleski, on the campaign trail, then denied the childish antics the whole world had just seen. \nWhen The Huffington Post assigned five reporters \nto scour the record of one of Trump's presidential debate performances\n, the team concluded: \"It took us hours, but in all, we found 71 separate instances in which Trump made a claim that was inaccurate, misleading or deeply questionable. That's basically one falsehood every 169 words, or 1.16 falsehoods every minute.\"\nIt doesn't stop there. \nIn two different books, Trump said he staged a comeback after being $9 billion in debt -- but when asked about the claim under oath,\n he acknowledged the figure was completely wrong\n, adding, \"Frankly, whether it's $9 billion or $3.6 billion, I don't think makes any difference to anybody if they hear the story.\"\nAnd Trump is being sued by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman for allegedly defrauding thousands of customers of Trump University  -- which was, of course, not incorporated or licensed as a university at all, and initially ignored government warnings not to call itself one. \nAccording to Schneiderman, people were charged thousands of dollars for courses on real estate that never began to live up to \nTrump's promises\n. \n\"If you look at the facts of this case, this shows someone who was absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people, to say whatever it took to induce them into his phony seminars,\" \nSchneiderman says\n. \"It was shameless. It was heartless.\"\nTrump may not enjoy the media scrutiny that comes with being a candidate for president, but it is the job of a free press to bring truth to light. One school of thought holds that Trump will win politically by attacking the press. That assumes that the public has no concern about learning when a candidate is exaggerating, distorting or fabricating information.  \nI prefer to think that voters are still in the information-gathering stage and will make a decision sometime between now and November 8 about how much any given fact matters. \nThat makes it the job of the press to do exactly what happened in this case: check and double-check everything the candidate says, whether he likes it or not. \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.", "CNN Poll of Polls: 2 points separate Clinton, Trump": "The Poll of Polls suggests a vastly different race than many anticipated. \nThroughout March and April, public polling on the presidential race found Clinton well ahead of Trump, with the former secretary of state holding double-digit leads over the businessman in 10 out of the 14 polls that met CNN's standards for reporting in those months.\nWhen Trump hits back, he hits back hard\nA string of polls released in the last two weeks, however, suggest a much tighter contest. For the most part, those tightened margins come from a more unified Republican Party. Across the five polls included in the Poll of Polls, Clinton averaged 6% support among self-identified Republicans. Polls from the same organizations in late-March and April found Clinton averaging 12% support among Republicans.\nWhat changed? Trump sealed the deal.\nTrump essentially locked up the Republican nomination for president in early May, when his final remaining rivals suspended their campaigns after Trump won the Indiana primary by a wide margin. Last week, Trump secured the support of enough unbound delegates to reach the 1,237-delegate threshold needed to win the nomination.\nClinton: Trump shamed into making donations to veterans groups\nClinton, by contrast, has not yet reached the 2,383-delegate threshold the Democratic Party requires, and rival Bernie Sanders continues his campaign. Several of these polls have found Clinton's support in a general election matchup against Trump continues to lag among those who back Sanders, softening her numbers at the same time Trump's are solidifying.\nBut a tight contest between Clinton and Trump isn't entirely a new phenomenon. Across six national, live-interviewer telephone polls conducted between the start of the year and mid-February, Clinton led Trump by just 2 points on average, and a tight race between the two was more common than a big Clinton lead in polling from early fall of last year through this spring.\nA close divide is a logical place for the race to be at this stage. Many studies have demonstrated the sharp political polarization that drives many Americans' views on key issues. At the same time, the share of voters truly \"up for grabs\" in any given election cycle has dwindled. The most recent \nWashington Post-ABC News poll\n found that just 7% of registered voters who aren't currently supporting Trump say they would consider backing him, and likewise, just 7% of those not already backing Clinton would consider supporting her.\nClinton's flood-the-zone Trump strategy\nThe Poll of Polls suggests that about 1-in-8 registered voters isn't currently backing Clinton or Trump. Over the next five months, whether those voters can be convinced to support Clinton or Trump, decide to stay home or throw their backing to a third party candidate will be the key to the campaign.\nThe CNN Poll of Polls is an average of the results of the five most recent nationwide polls of presidential preference among registered voters. The Poll of Polls includes: The \nCBS News/New York Times poll\n conducted May 13-17, the \nFox News poll\n conducted May 14-17, the \nNBC News/Wall Street Journal poll \nconducted May 15-19, the \nABC News/Washington Post poll\n conducted May 16-19, and the Quinnipiac University Poll conducted May 24-30.

There were all kinds of re-dos that had to be put in place as a result of what he did, and while those things were being done we were blind in certain really critical areas. So what he did was not without consequence.\" \nSnowden, who has spent the last few years in exile in Russia, should return to the U.S. to deal with the consequences, Holder noted. \n\"I think that he's got to make a decision. He's broken the law in my view. He needs to get lawyers, come on back, and decide, see what he wants to do: Go to trial, try to cut a deal.

", "Clinton's evisceration of Trump": "A speech that was billed as a major foreign policy address instead unfolded as a savage, mocking evisceration of Donald Trump Thursday as the former secretary of state adopted an aggressive new campaign persona designed to repel the unpredictable challenge posed by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nIn one of the most striking speeches of her political career, Clinton dispensed with the sober diplo-speak that has characterized her previous national security addresses and went straight for the jugular, unleashing a series of biting attacks on Trump.\nIn the spirit of President Lyndon Johnson's notorious \"Daisy\" nuclear blast ad targeting Barry Goldwater's temperament in 1964, Clinton warned that Trump should not be let anywhere near the nuclear codes because he could start a war when somebody \"got under his very thin skin.\"\n\"He's not just unprepared -- he's temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\" Clinton said during the speech in San Diego, California, days before Tuesday's primary in the Golden State effectively concludes the primary season and confirms her as the presumptive Democratic nominee over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nTrump fired back while speaking at a rally in San Jose, California, Thursday night.\n\"I watched Hillary today and it was pathetic. It was so sad to watch,\" Trump said, calling it a \"political speech\" that had nothing to do with foreign policy.\n\"It was a pretty pathetic deal,\" he added.\nThe speech marked a significant moment in Clinton's campaign, as it was the first real signal of the tactics and attitude she will use to take on Trump and offered a preview of what are likely to be fierce clashes between the rivals at a trio of presidential debates later in the year. It demonstrated the kind of sardonic, unrestrained humor that she often shows in private interactions with friends and reporters but has refrained from displaying in public.\nIt also appeared to be aimed at Democrats who are spooked by recent polls showing a tight race between Clinton and Trump, and who fear her often-criticized campaigning skills won't keep up with Trump's volatile and highly effective off-the-cuff style.\nRELATED: Trump unleashes on Clinton after day of attacks\nAnd when she argued that Trump's lack of knowledge on foreign policy and temperament would put at risk decades of Republican and Democratic foreign policy advances, she appeared to be making a pitch for disgruntled national security conservatives who feel unable to put their trust in the Republican nominee.\nYet the strategy has its risks, as pretty much all of Trump's GOP primary rivals who tried to take on Trump couldn't survive his return fire. The question is whether Clinton will be more effective. She might be helped by not waiting until the last minute like the Republicans did -- seeking to define Trump early in the minds of the general election audience.\nShe attempted to convince voters that Trump's ideas are a mix of \"bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.\" She lambasted his \"bragging\" approach to foreign policy based on a string of \"nasty tweets\" and accused him of harboring a \"bizarre\" affinity for authoritarian leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Communist rulers of China and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un.\n\"We cannot put the safety of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America,\" Clinton said.\nRELATED: Clinton takes on Trump: Her 34 toughest lines\nAt one point, Clinton imagined Trump composing nasty tweets to respond to her speech. And the combative Republican standard-bearer did not disappoint.\n\"Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!\" the presumptive GOP nominee wrote as her address ended.\nIn another tweet, Trump added: \"Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!\"\nBut taking a page from Trump's book, Clinton's speech contained a string of zingers meant to ridicule the presumptive presidential GOP nominee and render him an unacceptable choice for president.\n\"He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,\" Clinton said. \"The stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels.\"\nShe added: \"I will leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his attraction to tyrants\" before taking aim at Trump's claim that being a global business tycoon equips him with significant global knowledge.\n\"You know, there's no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal,\" she said. \"But it doesn't work like that in world affairs.\"\n \"He also says, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.' You know what? I don't believe him,\" Clinton said, drawing cheers from her partisan audience of around 250 people.\nAides said that Clinton never intended the speech to be a formal foreign policy address but rather to deliver a stinging rebuke of Trump. After watching and reading Trump speeches carefully, Clinton gave an outline of what she wanted to say at the beginning of last week, and speechwriters Megan Rooney and Dan Schwerin worked with foreign policy advisers Jake Sullivan and Laura Rosenberger on the first draft, two campaign aides told CNN.\nFor the last few days, they've been going back and forth with Clinton to streamline it. Originally, there was more of her own foreign policy, but it was sharpened over last week to include far more Trump.\nShe spent her coast-to-coast plane ride Wednesday revising the speech with Rooney. Clinton kept working on the specific language right up right before the speech, and a story about Navy SEALs protecting civilians during the 2011 operation that killed Osama bin Laden was a final addition.\nIn terms of policy, much of what she talked about -- including her views on NATO, trade and Russia -- has already been rolled out in previous, more conventional foreign policy speeches.\nBut she did focus on the more controversial aspects of the foreign policy that he has laid out. \nRELATED: Donald Trump's obsession with himself\n\"This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia. This is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO, the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home,\" Clinton said.\n\"He believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008,\" she continued. \"He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture.\"\nClinton's speech laid out the parameters for what is likely to be a furious foreign policy debate in the general election. It is a feud that will allow her to take aim at Trump's alleged inexperience and lack of knowledge but will also require her to defend what Republicans see as deep vulnerabilities in her own foreign policy record.\nThose liabilities include the aftermath of the NATO intervention in Libya, in which she played a dominant role and which left behind a dangerous failed state and a terror haven, as well as the Obama administration's \"reset\" of relations with Russia, which critics say was na\u00efve and ineffective.\nRELATED: First he fought in Iraq, now he could battle Trump, Clinton\nClinton must also confront accusations that she negligently put American national security at risk by using a personal email server for her official business when she served as secretary of state.\nTrump has already made his own attempt to obliterate Clinton's foreign policy credentials.\n\"She doesn't have the temperament to be president. She's got bad judgment. She's got horribly bad judgment,\" Trump said last week. \"If you look at the war in Iraq, if you look at what she did with Libya, which was a total catastrophe.\"\nThe likely Democratic nominee closed out her speech with a preview of how she will respond to such attacks -- by turning the heat back on Trump and his perceived lack of qualifications to be president.\n\"Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States. Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle. Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal,\" she said.\n\"Do we want him making those calls -- someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism?\" she asked rhetorically. \"Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?\" ", "Ginsburg, Sotomayor dish out SCOTUS lunchroom secrets": "Specifically, they participated in a panel discussion at the Smithsonian exploring the history of food and culture at the Supreme Court, and in doing so revealed not only how the court uses meal times to build bonds, but also the peculiar gastronomic habits of some modern-day justices. \nAlthough in the days of Chief Justice John Marshall the justices would gather together for meals at a boarding house, today they meet regularly in an elegant conference room for lunch. The motivation is the same: They use meal times to know one another better. \nRuth Bader Ginsburg moniker graces new praying mantis species\nBut there's a golden rule, according to Sotomayor: No one can discuss ongoing cases. They avoid controversial topics, she said, but discuss museum exhibits, music and books.  \nGinsburg noted she doesn't participate when the conversation turns to sports.\nThe \"real\" sportsperson is Elena Kagan, Sotomayor said Wednesday night at the event sponsored by the National Museum of American History and the Supreme Court Historical Society. \nBesides the lunches the justices gather for celebrations such as birthdays. There is some singing, despite the fact, according to Ginsburg, that not many of them can \"carry a tune.\"\nThere are meals to welcome a new justice, and retirement parties \u2014 and the one for Sandra Day O'Connor is still fondly remembered. O'Connor insisted she didn't want a party, so Justice David Souter came up with the idea of having her pick any movie she would like to see. She chose \"\nRed River\n\" with John Wayne. \"It had every politically incorrect thing in it.. it was sexist...it was racist,\" Ginsburg said. \nSometimes the justices bring food to the Court. Ginsburg spoke of how the late Justice Antonin Scalia was an \"intrepid hunter\" who would bring his colleagues everything from \"fish to fowl.\" O'Connor brought beef jerky made by her brother. (\"It was very spicy,\" Ginsburg offered.)\nShe repeated the story of how Justice Anthony Kennedy has been known to bring fancy wines to the dinner some of the justices share before attending the State of the Union, which causes her, on occasion, to get sleepy during the President's speech.\nEight is enough?

She noted that they \"come to talk to me more\" if they know there is candy to be had.\nNeither justice bragged of any outstanding culinary skills. In fact, Ginsburg allowed that her late husband, Marty Ginsburg, who was a gourmet chef, \"began his fondness in the kitchen, I think, shortly after I made my first meal.\"\nGinsburg said her daughter phased her out of the kitchen at an early age when she learned the difference between \"mommy's cooking and daddy's.\" Sotomayor enjoys cooking, believes that \"eating is sacred,\"  but has never mastered Puerto Rican fare.\nOther justices order salad from the cafeteria, or pack a lunch.\n\"My dear colleague \nDavid Souter\n,\" Ginsburg said, with a hint of distaste, ate one thing for lunch most days: plain yogurt.\n\"I understood,\" Sotomayor said, \"he had an apple.\"\nYes, Ginsburg replied.

While a federal judge barred the release of video from the deposition, the transcript was released on Tuesday.\nMills further suggested that Clinton's decision to use a personal email was motivated by \"the convenience of being able to use a common device\" and wasn't given much thought.\nClinton gave a similar explanation last year when news of her email practices first emerged.\n\"I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two,\" \nshe told reporters at a news conference\n. \nBut the IG report also highlighted an exchange between Clinton and her deputy chief of staff for operations that offers a potentially conflicting account of why Clinton's email was set up the way it was.\nIn November 2010, the report said, the deputy chief of staff of operations told Clinton that State Department employees were not receiving her emails. \n\"We should talk about putting you on State email or releasing your email address to the department so you are not going to spam,\" he emailed her.\nClinton responded: \"Let's get separate address or device but I don't want any risk of the personal being accessible.\"\nAnd Clinton's critics argue her decision to use the personal server exclusively was an attempt to circumvent the Federal Records Act, which requires personnel to preserve all official communications for archiving purposes, and to ensure they're available for public release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\nIt's also something the inspector general report criticized.\n\"At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with the department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act,\" the report said.\nThe IG report cites a particular email exchange from 2011, between Mills, Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, executive secretary Stephen Mull and deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin.\nIn the exchange, Mull proposes providing Clinton with a State Department BlackBerry after her personal device experienced malfunctions.\nThe device, which Mull noted \"would mask her identity, but which would also be subject to FOIA requests,\" was rejected by Abedin, who replied that it \"doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\"\nMills, in last week's deposition, was asked whether she and her colleagues had considered the fact that Clinton's emails would be concealed from FOIA officials unless the individuals she corresponded with were archiving them.\nMills said she was under the assumption that all Clinton's emails were being archived on the receiving end, but said she didn't give the matter much thought.\n\"Did anybody ever address any concerns that they couldn't access the secretary's account to respond to FOIA?\" a lawyer for Judicial Watch asked.\n\"I'm not aware of it,\" Mills said. \"They might have, and certainly from my standpoint I wish that had been something we thought about.\"\nMills said she only discussed the genesis of the account and its configuration with Clinton after both had left the State Department. Because she now represents Clinton as an attorney, she would not go into detail about those conversations.\nThe IG report found that that key officials \"were not asked to approve or otherwise review the use of Secretary Clinton's server and that they had no knowledge of approval or review by other Department staff.\" \nClinton rejected that conclusion by pointing to other secretaries of state who used personal email, including Colin Powell, in a Tuesday interview with MSNBC. She also dismissed the report's assertion that officials in the State Department were discouraged from talking about her email practices.\nThe report specifically mentions an exchange between a staffer in the Bureau of Information Resource Management and her director. When the staffer raised concerns about the email server, the report says, \"the director stated that the mission of (the bureau) is to support the secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the secretary's personal email system again.\"\n\"I do not know who that person is or what that person might have said because it's not anything that I am aware of,\" Clinton told MSNBC. \"I emailed with hundreds of people ... I certainly never instructed anyone to hide the fact that I was using a personal email.\"\nMills said she knew that Clinton was using a personal email account early on in her tenure at State, but viewed it as the \"continuation of a practice (Clinton) had been using when she was senator.\"\nClinton's campaign has acknowledged that she transitioned from a personal AT&T email account to the clintonemail.com server shortly after she became secretary of state, an account Mills supported.\n\"I recall that there was a point at which she had to transition her email address and told everyone that she had a new email address,\" Mills said.\nBecause of the scope of Judicial Watch's lawsuit, last week's deposition focused primarily on the decision to set up a private server and the State Department's responsiveness to FOIA requests.\nHowever, the group is also seeking to depose Mills as part a separate lawsuit related to the email issue and could expand on their line of questioning at that time. If the judge in that case approves their proposal, they will have another opportunity to question Mills, as well as Clinton, under oath.", "Stephen Hawking: Trump 'is a demagogue'": "But asked to account for Donald Trump's political rise Tuesday, the British theoretical physicist was stumped.\n\"I can't,\" Hawking told CNN affiliate ITV's \"Good Morning Britain\" program. \n\"He is a demagogue, who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately reply to a message requesting comment.\nFrosty response to Trump in UK\nHawking is not the first British public figure to make comments critical of the presumptive Republican nominee.\nTrump's comments on Islam on the campaign trail -- including a claim that Britain has a \"massive Muslim problem\" -- have provoked a backlash in the UK, with \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron\n and \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan\n among the many politicians weighing in against the businessman-turned-politician. \nBritish parliamentarians even debated a potential ban on Trump from the UK \n-- which was triggered by a public petition -- for alleged hate speech over his comments.\nTrump jabs at Bill Kristol over independent candidate prediction\nHawking: Stay in the EU\nHawking, who has previously joked about his dismay at the U.S. presidential race, also weighed in on \nthe Brexit issue\n, saying he hoped Britons voted to remain in the European Union when a referendum is held on the issue next month.\n\"Gone are the days we could stand on our own, against the world. We need to be part of a larger group of nations, both for our security, and our trade,\" the 74-year-old said. \n\"There are two obvious reasons why we should stay in. The first is that it promotes the mobility of people. Students can come here from EU countries to study, and our students can go to other EU universities,\" he said.\nLeave the EU or stay? Two British MEPs say why Brussels makes them so sure\n\"More importantly, at the level of research, the exchange of people enables skills to transfer more quickly, and brings new people with different ideas. Without this exchange we would become more culturally isolated and insular, and ultimately more remote from where progress is being made.\"\nHawking also brushed off a suggestion he had benefited from a surge of interest following actor Eddie Redmayne's Oscar-winning portrayal of him in the 2014 movie \"The Theory of Everything.\"\n\"I had many fans before Eddie Redmayne played me,\" he said.", "Why I'm voting for Trump": "And Trump is thriving, tapping into the fears and anxieties that have erupted into the open in an extraordinary presidential campaign.\nThe voters pledging their allegiance to the Republican front-runner hail from all corners of the country. They work on farms, in nursing homes and run small businesses; they've voted for Mitt Romney and Barack Obama and participated in the tea party movement; they are high school students who will vote for the first time this November and retirees and veterans who came of age during World War II.\nIn Trump, these people see the next president of the United States. \nHis attitude, one voter said, is that he \"seems to just not give a f---.\" Trump's nativist rhetoric and hardline immigration stance is a relief for those who see a segment of the population \"getting away\" with breaking the law. Post-San Bernardino, the candidate's promise to \"bomb the sh-- out of ISIS\" exudes an uncomplicated confidence rare in other politicians. His accomplishments in the business world offer reassurance that he'll \"put the economy back where it belongs.\"\nPerhaps most important is Trump's imperviousness to the typical boundaries around race. He has made provocative remarks on the subject since the earliest days of his campaign -- and his supporters are listening. They are rowdy, and at times, even violent. On more than one occasion, they've accosted protesters, lobbing racial slurs and physical abuse.\nThe following story attempts to capture the remarkable Trump phenomenon -- and the anti-establishment anger, and the racial and economic fears beneath it -- through the people who have flocked to Trump rallies since last summer. The voices were chosen from more than 150 people -- including supporters and opponents of Trump -- that CNN reporters interviewed in 31 cities across the country over the past few months and asked about some of the candidate's more controversial statements.\n  \nThese interviews provide a snapshot of a political movement unprecedented in modern politics. They reflect some of the loudest and most passionate defenders of Trump, a candidate who has said he has such deep loyalty among his supporters that he could \"stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.\" Many people CNN interviewed were not turned off by Trump's provocative remarks \u2014 but inclined to agree with his statements and his unvarnished approach to self-expression. \nThere is no getting around the impression that for some, racial attitudes are fueling their support.\nBut there are also other factors feeding the enthusiasm: the belief that Americans are unsafe, and he will protect them; an appreciation for the simple good vs. evil worldview he presents; an admiration of his celebrity status and business background. And, above all, a faith that he will restore an America they feel has been lost to them, and dream of experiencing again. \nWhy can't they follow the rules?\nThere's widespread anger that too many immigrants are simply \"getting away\" with not playing by the rules at the expense of hard-working white Americans. Why do some people not pay taxes? Not have jobs? Come into the country illegally?\nOn October 21, a line had begun to form outside the Burlington Memorial Auditorium in southeast Iowa by mid-afternoon. Trump, at the time topping national and Iowa polls, was scheduled to speak at 6 p.m.\nOne of the people waiting in line -- a woman in her 30s named Norma Sweet -- stood out. She appeared to be the only non-white person waiting for Trump.\nSweet was there with her husband, Terry Sweet, who is more than 30 years her senior. They said Norma came to the country 13 years ago from the Philippines and that she has been a citizen for 8 years. Speaking with a CNN reporter, Terry proudly pointed to his wife as an example of immigration done \"correctly.\"\n\"It's not fair to her to let the illegals stay here. She does everything right. She works, she pays taxes, she votes,\" he said.\nThe couple said they both planned to vote for Trump.\nThis sentiment -- that too many immigrants are bending the rules and even have a leg up on American-born citizens -- is widespread among Trump supporters, despite laws that bar illegal immigrants from receiving benefits such as welfare, food stamps and Medicaid. These individuals have drawn comfort from Trump's hardline immigration stance and his vow to create a system in which \"no one is above the law.\"\nA November \nCNN/Kaiser Family Foundation survey\n captured the white frustration around race that Trump is tapping into. A majority of whites have a fundamentally different view of whether the federal government should ensure income equality between whites and minorities: 57% of whites said this was not the government's burden, but a majority of African-Americans (67%) and Hispanics (63%) said it was. \nPaul Weber of Appleton, Iowa, describing himself as \"kind of a redneck\" at an October Trump rally in Waterloo, said he was tired of the so-called \"new Americans\" flooding the country.\n\"The people that are coming in here from China, Indonesia and all of them countries, they're getting pregnant and coming here and having babies,\"  Weber said, telling an Asian reporter that he meant no offense. \"They get everything and the people that were born here can't get everything.\"\nA woman named Deena from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, attending a Trump rally there in late November made the following analogy about illegal immigration.\n\"I come home and someone's occupying my house and they're eating my food and then they're taking the kids from my bed; they're taking the money out of my pocket,\" said Deena, who said she was still undecided on Trump. \"Why should we have to support someone else and then make our kids suffer, our families suffer?\"\nBut some of these same individuals are also quick to emphasize that their deep concerns about illegal immigration don't necessarily make them anti-immigrant.\nSherry Schnell, a \"big fan\" of Trump even before he decided to run for president, said she was in favor of both a wall along the Mexico border and more immigrants.\n\"If we have them all come in, they've all been inspected and they've all gone through the rules and regulations to become a citizen, I want more,\" Schnell said at a Trump rally in Sarasota. \"The more the merrier.\" \nA divisive President\nThere is a very palpable anger at President Obama. Many Trump supporters say he can't be trusted, he cares more about the welfare of black people than whites and he's inflamed racial divisions in the country. Others say they're convinced that he's Muslim.\nLong before the wall along the Mexico border and a Muslim \"ban,\" Trump was fixated on another controversial issue: Obama's birthplace.\nFor years, the real-estate developer has publicly questioned whether Obama was in fact born in Hawaii, and in turn, his eligibility to be president. Though he has shown little interest in reviving that theory as a presidential candidate, Trump is now aiming that skepticism at one of his rivals, Ted Cruz, alleging that because the Texas senator was born in Canada, he may not be eligible to run for president.\nFor many Trump fans, the candidate's once prominent role in the so-called Obama \"birther\" movement has left a lasting impression. \nThe skeptics, dispersed throughout Trump rallies, have serious misgivings about the President's U.S. citizenship and Christian faith more than four years after Obama publicly released his birth certificate.\n\"Islam is traced patrilineally. I am a Muslim if my father is Muslim. In that sense, it is undeniable that Barack Obama was born a Muslim,\" Michael Rooney said at a Trump event in Worcester, Massachusetts, in November. (Obama is a Christian. He has said his father was born a Muslim and later became an atheist.)\nRooney, a respiratory therapist in his late 40s, likened Obama's Christian faith to Caitlyn Jenner's recent gender transition: \"It is true that he now identifies as a Christian in the same sense that Bruce Jenner identifies as a woman.\"\nAt another rally in Manassas, Virginia, on December 2, Robin Reif, 54, yelled into the crowd that the President was from Kenya. He told CNN afterward that Obama was \"too much of a Muslim\" and an \"Islamist sympathizer.\"\n\"In our Constitution, it says that the president has to be an American citizen,\" Reif said. \"I'm still wondering where is he really from. What is this man's background?\"\nThe widespread distrust of the President has to do with much more than just his birthplace or religion.\nIf the President's supporters view his 2008 election as an historic moment that helped break down a racial barrier, others blame the country's first African-American President for deepening racial tensions.\nSaid George Ziegler, a Trump supporter attending a Columbus, Ohio, rally on November 23: \"Obama was supposed to bring us together. Instead, he's divided us.\"\nThe silent majority: 'No one's looking out for the white guy anymore'\nEnergizing the Trump movement are voters who call themselves the \"silent majority.\" These individuals feel strongly that white people, too, face discrimination in this country, and that they are often wrongly accused of being racist. This is stirring anger at the Black Lives Movement. \nFueled by a series of deadly police shootings perpetrated by white officers against blacks, the Black Lives Matter movement has become a powerful symbol of the racial tensions that run deep in the United States.\nAngry protesters spilled onto the streets of Baltimore, Ferguson and Chicago, determined to have their voices heard. More than five decades after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and well into Obama's second term, racial discrimination against African-Americans may have become less overt but is still very much a reality, the activists pleaded. \nAt Trump's campaign rallies, a similar frustration is palpable -- among white voters.\nTaking their cue from Trump, these individuals are calling themselves the \"silent majority.\" Some say they suffer from \"reverse discrimination.\"\nRhett Benhoff, a  middle-aged white man at a December Trump campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina, said discrimination against whites is \"absolutely\" real.\n\"I mean, it seems like we really go overboard to make sure all these other nationalities nowadays and colors have their fair shake of it, but no one's looking out for the white guy anymore,\" he said.\nAmong Trump supporters, suspicion and anger toward the Black Lives Matter movement run deep. These people say the group's name and slogan seem to convey that black lives are more important than white lives.\n\"I think it's bulls---,\" said Ziegler, the 61-year-old diehard Trump fan who attended his Columbus, Ohio, rally. \"All lives matter. You know this is bulls---- about black lives matter -- doesn't all lives matter?\"\nIt's the last word in Trump's now-ubiquitous campaign slogan -- \"Make America Great Again\" -- that seems to have touched a nerve. Recent polls show that white people increasingly feel that the American Dream is out of reach, and a sizable group of white Americans feel they are subjected to racial discrimination -- a perception of the white experience shared by few minorities.\nAlmost half of whites -- 47% -- said in a November CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation survey that there is discrimination against whites, far more than the share of blacks and Hispanics who said the same.\nAnd just over half of whites said they did not support the Black Lives Matter movement. Whereas 86% of blacks said the justice system was tilted toward white people, only 48% of whites said the same.\nAt the Trump rally in Myrtle Beach, where signs that read \"silent majority\" dotted the crowd, Patricia Saunders told CNN that Trump is speaking directly to a segment of the population that feels left behind and marginalized.\n\"White Americans founded this country,\" said Saunders, 64. \"We are being pushed aside because of the President's administration and the media.\"\nA country under attack\nMany Americans are deeply frightened by the recent spate of terrorist attacks around the world and wonder whether Obama is doing enough to keep the country safe. Trump's explosive proposals to increase surveillance of mosques, keep a database of Muslim-Americans and enforce a temporary \"ban\" on Muslims entering the country have energized his supporters.\nBrothers Ernie Martin and Lee Walter from Cresco, Iowa, were among a group of zealous Trump fans at the front of the line outside a Trump rally in Des Moines on December 11. They had waited more than seven hours to see the candidate in person.\n\"Hey, hey. Ho, ho. All the Muslims have to go!\" Walter, a 64-year-old retired factory worker, began to chant.\nJust days before, Trump -- who had already said he would implement a national database to register Muslims in the United States -- had put out a startling press release: a call for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"\nThe proposal marked one of the most striking examples of Trump's penchant for forceful national security rhetoric and came on the heels of two deadly events that shifted the course of the 2016 race: the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people in November, followed by a shooting in San Bernardino, California, a few weeks later that left 14 people dead.\n \nIt drew swift and widespread condemnation, including from some of Trump's fellow GOP rivals and the Muslim-American community.\nBut at Trump rallies, the proposal resonated in a different way.\nJust hours after Trump made the controversial announcement, his supporters -- waiting to hear him speak in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, said they were fully on board.\n\"I don't want them here,\" Ed Campbell said. \"Who knows what they're going to bring into this country?\"\nThe mass shooting in San Bernardino marked a turning point -- the first real evidence that ISIS could also kill on American soil. Trump seized on deep-seated fears about the country coming under siege, labeling himself the \"most military person there is\" and vowing to \"bomb the sh\u2014out of ISIS.\"\nBickie Mason, a contractor from Lyman, South Carolina, who attended Trump's Spartanburg rally in November, said he felt he didn't have a choice but to agree with Trump's idea of tracking Muslim-Americans through a national database.\n\"I don't believe all Muslims are bad. But anybody can turn bad, and you've got to be able to locate them and know where they're at,\" said Mason, 64.\nTrump's Muslim ban has unleashed \nmore visceral reactions\n, including unambiguously hostile views toward Islam.  \nHis supporters across the country -- from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina -- told CNN in interviews they simply believe Islam is not a peaceful religion.\n\"Islam is not a religion. It's a violent blood cult. OK?\" said Hoyt Wood, a 68-year-old military veteran waiting to hear Trump speak aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. \"All they know is violence, that's all they know.\"\nAt the same rally, 55-year-old Susan Kemmelin said, \"We can't look at a Muslim and tell if they're a terrorist or friendly.\"\nRobert Engelkes, a 45-year-old corn and soybean farmer from Dike, Iowa, pointed out that there is historical precedent for targeting one group.\n\"What did we do in World War II? We put all the Japanese in internment camps,\" said Engelkes, who was standing outside a Trump event in Des Moines. \"We had to do something with them.\"\nDonald Trump: A candidate like we've never seen before\nTrump has mesmerized voters. People say they have never seen a presidential candidate like Trump: He's unfiltered; he's anti-establishment; he exudes confidence and strength; he's not a politician.\nIf anything has been more surprising than Trump's endurance this election cycle, it's the seemingly fierce loyalty of his supporters.\nIt began in June with just a few hundred people crammed into the shiny lobby of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan, there to witness Trump finally confirm the rumors -- he was indeed running for president.\nWhen he hit the campaign trail, the crowds quickly swelled.\nThousands were soon turning up at school gymnasiums, auditoriums and local event halls to see Trump in person, forming long, winding lines that often spilled into overflow rooms. In the first weeks and months of Trump's campaign, plenty of attendees admitted they were there to catch a glimpse of the former host of the \"The Apprentice\" -- maybe even shake hands with the TV star.\nBut as the 69-year-old New Yorker rose to the top of the GOP pack, voters -- along with many in the media who had assumed the Trump campaign would be short-lived --started to reassess the unlikely presidential candidate.\nTrump's colorful off-the-cuff speeches and forceful message on immigration and national security were reverberating. The curious, star-struck observers increasingly gave way to fans eager to pledge their support to the political newcomer.\nNicomi Kloempken, a Trump supporter at a Raleigh, North Carolina, campaign event in early December, put it bluntly: \"He seems to just not give a f---, you know what I mean?\"\nThat attitude would propel Trump from one controversy to the next, starting on\n Day One\n. \n \nRather than turn supporters off, each inflammatory statement only seemed to reinforce Trump's novelty and appeal.\nCurt Handschug, an independent voter from Columbus, Ohio, who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, said he believes 2016 is the year of \"Donald Trump or nobody.\" Trump's willingness to speak the truth, he said, set him apart from politicians.\n\"Sometimes he'll say things, and I'll go, 'Oh gosh, seriously?' But at least he's willing to say it,\" Handschug said at a Trump rally in November. \"All these politicians are afraid to tell the truth.\"\nAnd next to a GOP field crowded with governors, senators and ex-politicians, Trump's successful business career is a refreshing contrast.\n\"I like him because he's a businessman. He does what he says he's going to do. I've seen him lose a ton of money and bounce back,\" said Trump supporter Linda Wilkerson at a Raleigh campaign event. \"We're in terrible financial debt. I hope he can bail us out.\"\nTrump took the lead as the candidate most trusted to handle the economy last summer, and continues to dominate the field on the issue. According to the latest CNN/ORC polling, 57% of Republican voters nationally say they trust Trump over the rest of the field on the economy. In Iowa, he holds nearly a 40-point lead over Cruz as more trusted to handle the economy, 54% to 16%, and in New Hampshire, a CNN/WMUR poll finds 48% say they trust Trump most, while no other candidate tops 7%.\nIf Trump goes all the way to the general election, he would be the first businessman who has never held public office to win the GOP nomination since Wendell Willkie in 1940.\n\"With his background, he's going to put the economy back where it belongs,\" said Jamie Peckham, another Trump fan at the same Raleigh event.  \nTrump is also attracting a small but enthusiastic contingent of teenagers.\nTurner Eakins and two of his friends from Millard North High School, drove from Omaha, Nebraska, to a Trump rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, at the end of December. Marveling at the candidate's authenticity and disregard for political correctness, the three teens told CNN they all plan to cast their first votes for Trump this year.\n\"Politics is supposed to be boring,\" said Eakins, who will turn 18 by primary day. \"So when three 18-year-old kids are driving out 30 minutes to go to a Trump rally, I mean -- that's a movement.\"\n \nThe protesters\nWho are they? Why are they so upset with Trump? How does Trump's rhetoric about minorities in the U.S. make them feel? And why have recent protests become increasingly ugly and even violent?\nTrump was in the middle of boasting about his latest poll numbers. \"We're winning all over the country,\" he boomed at a November campaign rally in Birmingham, Alabama.\nThen he noticed the commotion on the floor of the packed convention hall -- another protester was trying to interrupt his speech. \"Get 'em the hell out of here,\" Trump said, waving his hand dismissively.\nThis outburst would turn out to be a little different from other protests at Trump rallies because a \nCNN reporter was filming \nthe crowd's violent reaction to the protester. The grainy cell phone footage showed angry Trump fans pushing, kicking and jeering at the man, who at one point was lying on the ground. \nThe 31-year-old Black Lives Matter activist, Mercutio Southall, told CNN afterwards that the people around him had called him \"monkey\" and the N-word.\n\"I got punched in the face, I got punched in the neck. I got kicked in the chest. Kicked in the stomach. Somebody stepped on my hand,\" he said.\nWhile the Birmingham incident marked one of the first times that a physical altercation was captured on camera and widely viewed, it was hardly the first time that this kind of raw anger had boiled over at a Trump rally, pitting protesters against Trump fans.\nOn October 10, two Asian female high school students took off their tops at a Trump rally in Norcross, Georgia, revealing writing on their bare chest and stomach: \"LEGAL IMMIGRANT\"; \"offense taken\"; \"F--- TRUMP\"; \"WOMEN SHAMER\"; \"RACIST PIG.\"\nTheir yelling infuriated the people around them. Some started to shout: \"Anchor babies! Go home!\" Others shoved Trump campaign posters at the women and used the signs to block cameras, cheering when the hecklers were finally escorted out of the building.\n \n\"I was actually an immigrant myself nine years ago from South Korea, and Trump's beliefs on minorities, it's just ridiculous,\" Yu Jin Kim, one of the two women, told CNN outside. \"Would you really want the next president to be racist and disregard a third of the country?\"\nSara Park, whose parents are immigrants, said she was there to \"stand up for the community who can't stand up for themselves.\"\nProtests have become a common occurrence at Trump campaign rallies, fueled by the candidate's explosive statements about minority groups.\nAt a campaign rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, this month, a Muslim woman wearing a hijab stood up in silent protest as Trump spoke about the hidden presence of ISIS among Syrian refugees.\nAs Rose Hamid was escorted out of the building, one person shouted: \n\"You have a bomb, you have a bomb.\"\n \nSeveral days later, at another Trump event in Clear Lake, Iowa, there were mixed reactions to Hamid's removal from the event.\n\"If she was asked to sit down and she didn't, well, out she goes,\" said John Dusheck, a 63-year-old Trump supporter from Ventura, Iowa.\n\"She wasn't causing any troubles,\" said Steven Ziller, a farmer from Belmond. \"That was not right.\"\nCivil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who has watched these events with interest from afar, said he fears that Trump is in the process of unleashing long-running \"ignorance, fear and hatred in our country.\"\n\"He's tapped into a certain macho factor in the white community and it works for him. I know it's dangerous,\" said Jackson, a former presidential candidate. \"You have the anti-immigrant, anti-refugee component to this. Them versus us. Anti-Muslim.\"\nAli Ali attended a December 5 Trump rally in Spencer, Iowa. He said he was born in the African nation of Djibouti and grew up in fear of persecution, until he came to the United States as a refugee.\nThe 50-year-old Muslim-American said he knew he didn't belong in that crowd -- \"You can see, I'm the only Muslim of 3,000 people today in Spencer,\" he said -- but felt that by being in the same room as Trump, he might get a chance to share his grievances.\nBeing Muslim today is not easy, Ali told CNN, and Trump wasn't making it any easier.\n\"I'm a safe guy. I don't have no bomb. I never killed nobody. So I don't want to be labeled a terrorist,\" he said.\nTrump's rhetoric about Muslims, including his support for a database to track Muslim-Americans, is no different from the persecution of Jews decades ago, Ali said.\n\"They're doing to Muslims today what they (did) to Jewish (people) in 1938,\" he said. \"My name is Ali Ali, I'm from Shakopee, Minnesota, and my ID number: registration 00001. That will be me.\"\nTom LoBianco, Jeff Simon, Randi Kaye and Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.\nUPDATE: \nThis is story has been updated to use the name preferred by Caitlyn Jenner.", "Federal agencies knew airport guard was accused war criminal": "As CNN exclusively \nfirst reported\n on Wednesday, Yusuf Abdi Ali, who is accused of committing atrocities while he was a military commander during Somalia's brutal civil war, has been living outside Washington, D.C., for about 20 years. A CNN camera captured him guarding a security exit where ticketed passengers leave the airport. \nAli and his lawyer have denied all the allegations against him. When CNN approached Ali outside his apartment in Alexandria, Virginia, he declined an interview, saying, \"To tell you the truth, all is false. Baseless.\"\nWhen CNN asked how he was hired, each one of several federal agencies confirmed it knew about Ali's past but refused to give a reason why his background didn't raise red flags.\nAli works for a contractor, Master Security, hired by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, or MWAA. When CNN initially asked Master Security about Ali, the company said it was \"unaware of the pending litigation.\" In light of the \"very serious nature of the allegations,\" Ali is on administrative leave, and the company is reviewing the case, according to Chief Executive Rick Cucina. Ali's airport access has also been withdrawn.\nThe MWAA said Ali had undergone an FBI criminal background check and a Transportation Security Administration threat assessment, as mandated by federal law for all security guards who hold badges.\nThe FBI explained it only runs fingerprints through a domestic criminal background system and sends the results back.\n\"TSA provided the full results of its security screening to the Airport Authority who is ultimately responsible for issuing a badge for security contract work,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN. \"Based on the results of the security screening, he did not meet the criteria for denial of his application. We defer to the Airport Authority for further information on employment status.\"\nAli is being sued in civil court for torture. There is no criminal court in the world that can try him for war crimes, as none have the necessary jurisdiction.", "Clinton supporter says she'll face authenticity challenge": "\"Hillary Clinton has been on the public scene for a long period of time... [and] fairly well beaten up by various media and certainly the Republicans in general. They've kind of specialized in that. So I think the natural instinct is to almost go within yourself, lessen the surface area for attack, and be very guarded,\" Nutter told David Axelrod on \"The Axe Files,\" a podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \"That is a challenge for any elected official, but certainly one for higher office. I would say, at a minimum at the mayoral level and up, people want to know you.\"\n\"[She has] a little bit of that, 'What time is it?' And you get the history of watchmaking in America, so I think that's a part of it,\" he added. \"She's not a soundbite machine in that way.\" \nHowever, if Clinton opens up too much in an effort to combat Trump's shoot-from-the-hip style, that could alienate voters by appearing inauthentic, Nutter cautioned. \n\"If you try to change up too much, then you have a different form of an authenticity problem. Because what are you doing? We see that you're trying. You can't be someone that you're not,\" he said. \"Could she lighten up a little bit? Yes. I think it would be a mistake to go down the same path that all the other 16 or so Republicans went down, which is to try to engage him where he fights. My father used to take me to the fights all the time. Boxing matches. And one of the things you learn is never fight the other fighter's fight.\"\nUltimately, Nutter predicted, voters will face a choice this fall between two starkly different candidates, but in his opinion, the decision is an easy one. \n\"At the end of the day, I mean, she is like a real adult person who has a certain level of dignity and respect and is running for the presidency of the United States of America. And that's an area where she'll stay. He's still, I think, with the talk show, reality show kind of mindset,\" Nutter said. \"I want the person who understands the gravity and the intensity of this job... I don't know what he knows about running anything other than his own private business. Well, the United States of America is not your private business.\"\nTo hear the whole interview with Nutter, which also touched on how to improve community policing, what it's like overseeing one of the country's largest cities, and more, click on \nhttp://podcast.cnn.com\n.

It's part of President Barack Obama's initiative to focus on deporting convicted felons, threats to public safety and anyone who crossed the border into the U.S. illegally since January 2014. \nBut there are more than 300 so-called \"sanctuary cities\" in the nation where local leaders have created laws limiting -- and in some jurisdictions prohibiting -- local police and jail officials from cooperating with federal immigration officials. As a result, ICE officials say thousands of undocumented convicted criminals are released onto the streets every year.\nICE officials say they are asking local officials to at least notify ICE before releasing criminal undocumented immigrants from custody.\nLocal officials argue that cooperating with ICE without a court order violates the rights of the immigrants and makes their cities legally liable.\nIn this two-part series, CNN Justice Correspondent Pamela Brown takes a look at both sides of the issue, talking to ICE officials, local leaders and even one undocumented immigrant who was temporarily detained and then released.", "America's most eligible bachelor was not a TV contestant": "For Buchanan, it was all about the journey. After a broken engagement and the death of his former fiancee, Buchanan decided to run for national office. He was elected to the House of Representatives five times and served as a senator for a decade before receiving the Democratic Party's nomination for president in 1856, defeating incumbent President Franklin Pierce for the nomination. He was awarded the general election rose and served one term.\nDuring his career in politics, Buchanan was tied to a number of different women, but also to Senator and eventual Vice President William Rufus King.  \n\"They were always kind of with each other around town. They shared a house,\" said Patrick Clarke, director of James Buchanan's Wheatland.\nTo this day, rumors of a romantic relationship between the men persist, although no solid evidence has ever surfaced, according to Clarke.\nBut Buchanan's enemies were not in politics to make friends. \n\"Andrew Jackson picks on Rufus King by calling him 'Mrs. Buchanan,'\" Clarke said. \nBut Buchanan, like the contestants on \"The Bachelor\" reality TV franchise, was in politics for all the right reasons. In fact, his allies spun his bachelorhood as a plus. \n\"The Democratic Party was painting a more encouraging picture: Here's this bachelor. He has the time to focus on our problems as a nation,\" Clarke said.\nWatch the video above for the full story on America's original celebrity bachelor. ", "Why Trump is the next Walter White": "Donald Trump's candidacy is a product of this era. Part of his success has been to play to type. When he demeans his opponents and spews hateful words, commentators have predicted that those ugly remarks or a story about his background would somehow turn people against him. It never happened. \nTrump has thrived as he has done whatever he deemed necessary to win -- \ninflaming social tensions\n, making \nfalse and misleading statements\n about his opponents and \ntaking cheap shots \nto get media attention. His unfavorable ratings have skyrocketed, yet the \npolls with Hillary Clinton are narrowing\n.\nFrom mob dads to terrorist heartthrobs\nThis success should not surprise us; characters who are unlikable but emotionally relatable have long been the heart and soul of popular culture. We've always had antiheroes, such as J.R. on \"Dallas,\" but starting in the late 1990s, they became the norm. \nWith the premiere of \"The Sopranos\" in 1999, Americans were riveted by the story of Tony Soprano, a brutal New Jersey mob boss and father who liked to kill people with his bare hands. In one of the most famous episodes, while visiting colleges with his daughter, he sees a former colleague turned informant and finds some time to kill him. \nOn \"House,\" we followed the life of Dr. Gregory House -- an abrasive, arrogant and narcissistic drug addict. Yet every week viewers waited to see how he would use his brilliant medical mind and detective skills to save the day.\nJon Hamm's Don Draper on \"Mad Men\" captivated audiences while being absolutely brutal with the people who worked under him. \"Dexter\" viewers were rooting for a psychopathic serial killer. In \"Nurse Jackie,\" Edie Falco gave a mesmerizing performance as a brilliant nurse in New York who cheated on her husband and was addicted to Vicodin to the point of self-destruction. \nIn this season of \"Gotham,\" Ben McKenzie's Jim Gordon, who is the only saving grace of the city of young Bruce Wayne, slowly descends into a dark place, employing the tactics of the villains to save the city and even depending on the Penguin. From the moment the show started, we have been meant to love some of the main villains who hold the esteemed place that superheroes usually fill in the comic books. (Bruce Wayne is just a kid, so there is no Batman yet.) \nFrank Underwood in \"House of Cards\" is as villainous as they come. He literally kills his way to the presidency of the United States. Yet we watch to see how he will get out of the latest jam, and we root for him to defeat his adversaries. \"If a hero is someone we want to and should, within the structure of the story, root for, a villain is someone we want to and should root against, an anti-hero is someone a show succeeds in making you want to root for, even though, by all conventions of morality, we know we shouldn't,\" noted critic Alyssa Rosenberg\n in a review\n of the popular show \"The Americans\" -- which features two 1980s-era Soviet spies who are also a strong married couple and devoted parents to two children.\nOther antiheroes have done what \"The Americans\" does -- ask viewers to relate to characters who inhabit familiar and taboo types simultaneously. In \"Breaking Bad,\" Bryan Cranston delivered an award-winning performance as a high school chemistry teacher who becomes the nation's biggest meth kingpin. He was not the only family drug dealer whom we loved. In \"Weeds,\" Mary-Louise Parker played Nancy Botwin, a soccer mom who like Walter White starts the show as a regular suburbanite and who by circumstance turns into a major drug kingpin -- even dragging her children into the business.\nAmericans' love for the TV antihero shows that even terrorists can win our hearts. In the first season of \"Homeland,\" Damian Lewis played Nicholas Brody, a prisoner of war who returns to the United States as a trained assassin for overseas terrorists. In an unexpected twist, the character was sexy and powerful, not shady and scary.\nIs Trump our next TV antihero?\nThere are many more examples, on the small and big screen. In films, superheroes such Batman and Iron Man have been depicted as troubled individuals whose heroism comes out of deep personal background, and the lines between good and evil are often hard to see.\nTrump is the real life incarnation of the characters we love to watch in fictional shows. He perfected this character -- the boss who \"tells it like it is,\" whose tactics make us cringe but whose results keep us hooked on what happens next -- on his reality shows \"The Apprentice\" and \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" He fired and insulted people with an unsympathetic directness and dynamic charisma that fit into this antihero mold. We loved him not because we liked him, but we wanted to see how far he would go to get the job done.\nWhat does this say about us, or about the GOP candidate? Quite a lot, as it turns out. Popular culture spotlights a clear appetite for bad behavior as a way of building trust among a public that has become cynical about their leaders. In an era when so many institutions have become broken, from the economy to our politics, we find some kind of comfort in the person, no matter how ruthless, who shows the drive to get things done -- no matter what -- without letting that brokenness stand in his way.  \nAs one fan of \"The Apprentice\" -- who prefers Trump even though he doesn't support many of his policies -- recently\n told \nThe New York Times: \"A dark side of me wants to see what happens if Trump is in (the White House) ... It's like reality TV. You don't want to see everybody be happy with each other. You want to see someone fighting somebody.\"\nThe success of the pop culture antihero shows that this country is clearly comfortable with, even enthusiastic about, broadcasting nasty into its living rooms. More than any other candidate, Trump has understood how deeply rooted these feelings have become and he has successfully built an entire campaign around them. If Democrats think they will have an easy time stopping him in the fall, they might want to take a closer look at the characters who have been attracting the masses in recent years. \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.", "The week in politics": "Take a look at the week in politics from May 22 through May 28.", "UK isn't welcoming Donald Trump with open arms": "Presidential candidates have long used foreign travel to project a statesman-like image, burnish their foreign policy credentials, divert an unpleasant media storyline or take a break from the hyper-vigilant coverage at home.\nBut for every triumph, there are often pitfalls.\nWhile then-presidential candidate Barack Obama basked in the roaring approval of 200,000 Berliners in 2008, Republican nominee Mitt Romney's 2012 trip to the UK was a laundry list of gaffes -- including questioning Britain's ability to adequately secure that summer's Olympic Games -- that left him mocked and maligned.\nTrump's global real estate holdings, his ownership of the Miss Universe pageant -- not to mention his private Boeing 575 -- means he has international experience in at least 18 countries as far-flung as the United Arab Emirates, Panama and the Republic of Georgia. But it is also far from the traditional foreign policy-oriented background that elected officials seeking the highest office often have.\nStephen Hawking: Trump 'is a demagogue'\nSo like others before him, the presumptive Republican nominee is participating in the ritual of foreign trips by presidential candidates, a practice meant at least in part to provide photos in exotic locations symbolizing a candidate's ease with foreign issues. It's a particularly important message in a campaign cycle when foreign issues such as Russian aggression in Ukraine, Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea and international terrorism has gripped voters.\nNew York Magazine has reported that Trump is also considering a trip to Israel before the July GOP convention, where he is due to become the Republican Party's formal standard-bearer.\n\"Candidates often make trips during a campaign, usually for strategic reasons,\" said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's governance studies program. She notes that many candidates make a trip to Israel.\n\"Usually there's some sort of tie-in to something they want to say back home,\" she said.\nBut candidates' trips can backfire, as happened in 2004 when Democratic hopeful John Kerry was pilloried for speaking French too well while abroad, or last year when Republican candidate Ben Carson returned from a trip to Jordan and called refugee camps there \"really quite nice.\"\nHow Donald Trump could win\nTrump's trip is \"kind of weird, because this is basically a commercial trip,\" said Kamarck, who pointed to another potential risk.\n\"It undercuts his seriousness,\" she added. \"He's not going over there to make a foreign policy address at Oxford. He's going over there to promote a golf course.\"\nThe trip to the UK will be Trump's first overseas since he became the presumptive nominee, but he has racked up passport stamps in the past.\nTrump's aides say he generally travels internationally 15 to 20 times a year, adding that the exposure gives him an understanding of the security and financial situations in many different countries that prepares him for the presidency.\nThe likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, blasted that argument in a foreign policy speech Thursday in California.\nTrump \"says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,\" Clinton told a laughing crowd in San Diego, throwing in the fact that during her tenure as secretary of state, she visited 112 countries.\n\"The stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels,\" Clinton said. \"We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table -- bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets.\"\nPaul Ryan endorses Donald Trump\nA CNN count shows that Trump has traveled to at least 18 countries, including Brazil and Australia.\nClinton's criticism reflected the fact that a presidential candidate draws infinitely more scrutiny than a businessman and that the host of issues and decisions a real estate developer has confronted don't match that of a policymaker.\nTrump, who has drawn support from some conservative European politicians, has already ruffled feathers in the UK with statements he's made during his campaign. His comments about Mexicans and Muslims have affected the fortunes of the Turnberry golf course and hotel he'll visit June 24 and drew a rebuke from Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has already announced she won't meet Trump when he comes this month.\nThe timing of the New York real estate mogul's visit may offer him some protection from hostile or probing coverage, though.\nHe's arriving a day after a June 23 referendum that will decide whether the UK should stay in the European Union, a vote with huge implications for the political future of Prime Minister David Cameron, who backs EU membership, and more importantly for the country, which could be wrought by divisions over the results.\nPGA Tour to move tournament from Trump's Miami course -- to Mexico\nUK officials, speaking anonymously to discuss internal government business, said that the British Embassy in the U.S. has been in contact with Trump's campaign and those of the other candidates. But they said that it's unlikely that Cameron would make time to meet the GOP's presumptive nominee because his status hasn't been formalized yet and because of the potentially rocky aftermath of the crucial Brexit vote -- particularly since he is not traveling through London.\nAsked about Trump at the G7 summit meeting in Japan on May 27, the British Prime Minister referred to the historic ties between the U.S. and UK.\n\"I believe the special relationship will work whoever is in whichever jobs in the UK or in the U.S.,\" he said. \"Often these candidates choose to come through various European countries in the run-up to the U.S. elections. I don't know whether that will happen this time. No dates are fixed, but I'm always happy to meet people on that basis,\" he said.\nCameron had already described Trump's suggestion for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. as \"divisive, stupid and wrong.\"\nEarlier in the year, British \nparliamentarians debated\n banning Trump himself from the country.\nHis comments, as well as Trump's labeling Mexicans entering the U.S. \"rapists,\" also seemed to hurt the fortunes of the Turnberry golf resort that Trump bought in 2014 for some $50 million and then spent almost $290 million renovating.\nThe property features a presidential suite that guests can occupy for $5,000 a night and the Donald J. Trump ballroom, which publicists have described as \"the most luxurious meeting facility anywhere in Europe.\"\nThe British newspaper The Independent reported that following the candidate's comments on Mexicans and Muslims, a group that governs golf in the UK decided not to go forward with a plan to return a prestigious tournament to Turnberry in 2020.\nThe paper reported that British golf officials found Trump's reputation so \"toxic\" that they feared it would hurt sponsorship deals and that tournament players would pull out. Sturgeon rescinded Trump's status as a business ambassador and the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen stripped him of an honorary degree it had earlier awarded.\nDespite these and other incidents that have attracted British attention to Trump in the past, Kamarck said he wasn't likely to draw a great deal of notice on this trip given how focused the country is on the June 23 referendum.\n\"I can't imagine he would have any real impact in Britain,\" she said.  ", "Obama tells military grads U.S. needs 'steady' leader": "While Obama did not mention presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump in his remarks to graduates of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, he rebutted some of the foreign policy arguments Trump has put forward -- proposals that lean toward reducing America's role in global affairs.\n\"As we navigate this complex world, America cannot shirk the mantle of leadership,\" Obama said. \"We can't be isolationist. It's not possible in this globalized, interconnected world. In these uncertain times, it's tempting sometimes to pull back and try to wash our hands of conflicts that seem intractable, let other countries fend for themselves. But history teaches us, from Pearl Harbor to 9/11, that oceans alone cannot protect us. We cannot turn inward.\"\nThe President said being commander-in-chief was the \"highest honor of my life.\" \nObama added that while the country faces big challenges, American values like freedom and equal opportunity inspire the world, including immigrants striving to reach U.S. shores.\nThe speech to the Air Force Academy's class of 2016, which was more a tribute to the school's 812 graduates and to the U.S. military, highlighted the threats facing national and global security, from terrorism to Russian aggression to the conflict in the South China Sea.\nObama's remarks came just hours before former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was to deliver a foreign policy address in California in which aides said she would slam Trump's foreign policy approach and lay out why she believes he is \"unqualified\" and \"unfit\" to serve as president. \nObama also argued that treaties -- some of which Trump has questioned -- help keep America safe, citing as an example the treaty that established NATO.\nObama opened his remarks hailing the airmen he has come to know as president and joking that some days he spends more time with those in the Air Force than with his own family.\n\"I'm really gonna miss Air Force One,\" the President said, after noting the crew's punctuality, the fact that he does not have to take off his shoes before he flies, and that his luggage never gets lost.\n\"We can never know what the future holds but in the not so distant future when I'm no longer president, I will sleep knowing men and women like you serve to keep us free.\"", "State Department doctored video to hide Iran deal": "State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.\nKirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it. \nThe deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.  \nAfter it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.\nEarlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a \"narrative\" that they did not take place. \nWhen James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. \nKirby, who originally called the deletion a \"glitch,\" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. \n\"They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,\" Kirby said. \nAnother senior State Department official said the technician found the request \"unusual\" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone \"from a certain level and credibility\" in the Department of Public Affairs.\n\"Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,\" this official said. \"Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it.\" \nPsaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: \"I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept.\"\nKirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department.\nHe said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed.\n\"To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,\" he said. \"Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability.\"\nBecause such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found \"no reason\" to press forward with a more formal investigation.

If you're in business for yourself, I really think it's a bad idea. I think that was the single greatest cause of what happened to my marriage with Ivana,\" Trump said.\nHe said that he disliked hearing her \"shouting on the phone\" during contentious business deals.\n\"A softness disappeared. There was a great softness to Ivana, and she still has that softness, but during this period of time she became an executive not a wife,\" Trump had said.\nDonald Trump's immigrant wives\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee also discussed his then-marriage to Marla Maples. Trump said that while he enjoyed \"creating stars\" -- which he said was \"almost like creating a building\" -- such as Maples, their professional obligations were frustrating.\n\"I have days where I think it's great. And I have days where, if I come home -- and I don't want to sound too much like a chauvinist -- but when I come home and dinner's not ready, I go through the roof,\" he said.\nDonald Trump paid ex-wife in dresses\nTrump, however, has also praised women in the workplace -- or at least his willingness to hire them -- in his book, \"The Art of The Deal.\"\n\"My own mother was a housewife all her life.

What's the point?\"\nAfter arguing that Trump had only said that \"we believe\" Curiel is Mexican, Pierson continued to try to link the judge to anti-Trump protesters.\n\"Well, it's because of what we see outside of these rallies, these anti-Trump rallies, these criminal rallies, these criminal protesters out there defacing property and attacking police officers. They're doing so under the guise of an anti-Trump protest, with their Mexican flags, and La Raza and this judge is connected to that,\" Pierson said.\nEfforts to reach Curiel on Monday were not immediately successful.\nTrump ripped Curiel on Friday\n after the judge ruled parts of internal documents, including \"playbooks\" regarding running the enterprise, should be released as part of a lawsuit against Trump University, which operated from 2005 to 2010.\nThe playbooks, which include ones from 2009 and 2010, detail how the venture worked, how Trump University events were run and how to sell programs to customers. Curiel wrote that there is public interest in the case as Trump has become \"the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race, and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue.\"\nTrump on Friday argued there was no need to schedule a trial for the Trump University fraud suit, while noting Curiel's heritage. \n\"The trial is going to take place sometime in November. There should be no trial. This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily, everybody says it. But I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater.

The mere act of constructing one is pretty simple. But Trump is only half right; his wall will be a construction project borne of the United States federal government, a massive undertaking that will span thousands of miles, take years to build and require an incredible amount of political willpower and bureaucratic maneuvering.  \nThe red tape alone will be like nothing Trump -- master builder he may be -- has ever faced.\nIn an effort to discover just how much work it would require a Trump Administration to get his controversial wall project off the ground, CNN Politics spoke to experts on the federal bureaucracy and burrowed through the labyrinth of agencies that played a role in constructing the U.S.-Mexico border fence that former President George W. Bush set in motion in 2006. That was a project that has been beset with setbacks, lack of congressional interest and funding problems. \nThe Congress\nWhat became clear as we dug into the bureaucracy is that Trump can't just wake up on the first day of his presidency and order an army of builders to the border. His administration will first have to find a willing member of Congress to propose a bill in the House or Senate to secure the funds and begin the process. The bill's chances of survival will depend entirely on the make-up of the next Congress, as there are no guarantees that both chambers will remain under Republican control in 2017. Even if they are, he'll have to find enough Republicans will be willing to put their names on a multi-billion project that could turn into a boondoggle. \nThe wall bill would face steeper odds in the Senate, where Democrats are almost guaranteed to stage a filibuster, forcing it to require a two-thirds majority to break it. \nThe overseers\nAssuming a wall bill passes both chambers and Trump signs it, which will be no small feat, he will then have to face the federal bureaucracy. \nThe Department of Homeland Security would be saddled with a bulk of the project's responsibility. They oversee the Border Patrol under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those agents will be the ones manning the gates -- er, \"big, beautiful doors\" - -of Trump's wall. \nThe Army Corps of Engineers, which falls under the Defense Department, would provide studies and guidance for the project. And the Department of Transportation will have oversight over ensuring regulations are met for any federal roadways near the site. \nThe builders\nAs for construction, the Department of Labor would have to be involved with any large-scale federal project to oversee labor claims of the builders. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would ensure hiring practices are within the law and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration would oversee any workplace accidents.\nThe protectors\nThe wall, if constructed along the entire border, would stretch across diverse landscapes and natural habitats, snaking through federal land protected by the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Department of the Interior. There's also farm land, bringing in the Department of Agriculture, where agents will study the wall's impact, since plant an animal life that don't recognize man-made borders will surely be affected.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency would need to be consulted to provide an environmental impact statement. The EPA would almost surely raise red flags about the wall's impact on the environment, but that shouldn't be much of a problem for Trump: Under Bush's Border Fence Act in 2006, the Department of Homeland Security was granted the authority to waive any on-the-books regulations that got in the way of the project, so Trump would likely work a similar clause into his plan. \nThat doesn't mean there won't be consequences. The border is home to numerous floodplains, and the wall would block the natural flow of water. Flooding is almost guaranteed, so the Federal Emergency Management Agency will need to provide insight into their plan for such an inevitability. \nOther people's property\nThere are also massive parcels of private land lining the border, which will require the widespread use of eminent domain. Trump's lawyers in the Department of Justice would be called upon to defend the federal government's right to take such land. The National Weather Service under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would be required to monitor weather patterns. \nThe International Boundary and Water Commission would oversee disputes over use of the common border areas, such as the Rio Grande, which runs more than 1,000 miles along the border. \nEconomists and diplomats\nAs for the human impact, Mexico is one of the United States' biggest trading partners, so a new slab of concrete dividing the two nations will need to be monitored by the Commerce Department, including the International Trade Administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Economic Development Administration.\nThe Mexican's will surely see the project as an affront, so it would require massive feats of diplomacy. That brings in the State Department and all of its diplomats who work with the Mexican government on a regular basis. \nThe courts and the bean counters\nShould Trump follow through on his plan to force Mexico pay for the wall -- which would involve blocking people in the United States from sending remittances to families in Mexico -- he'll likely first need to go through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under the Federal Reserve. \nThat, and many of parts of his proposal are incredibly controversial, of course, so his administration is liable to be sued, requiring involvements of the federal courts, including, possibly, the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe list goes on. But these are just some of the complicated administrative and bureaucratic hurdles a president Trump would have to take on to accomplish what is distilled so simply in his campaign message: \"Build a wall.\" \nAs anyone who's ever worked with the federal government will tell you, it won't be so easy.\nVoice of Wall by Jay McMichael, CNN.", "Charity on Trump list linked to telemarketer accused of deception": "Two companies which solicited donations for the Foundation for American Veterans, based in suburban Detroit, were named in a civil suit filed last week by the Minnesota attorney general's office, according to a press release. \nThe lawsuit, the press release said, was filed against Associated Community Services and its affiliate, also based in Detroit, and accused the company of sending false \"pledge reminders\" to donors and calling potential donors, in one case 42 times in a four-month period.\nOn its federal 990 income tax filing for 2014, the Foundation for American Veterans lists donations of more than $8 million but fundraising and other expenses nearly matching the contributions received.

I do,\" he said on \"The Lead,\" pointing to Trump's recent scorching criticism of a prominent Republican Latina politician, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez. \n\"And I think the attacks that he's routinely engaged in, for example, going after Susana Martinez, the Republican governor of New Mexico, the chairman of the Republican Governors' Association, I think, was a big mistake,\" McConnell said.\nRegarding Goldwater's vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, McConnell said, \"It did define our party, for at least African-American voters, and it still does today. That was a complete shift that occurred that year and we've never be able to get them back. So I think it was a defining moment for Republicans with regard to the accomplishments that we had made for African-Americans going back to the Civil War.\"\nMcConnell has endorsed Trump and has been far less vocal about his problems with Trump's temperament or policy than House Speaker Paul Ryan, who \nformally endorsed Trump\n on Thursday after initially saying he wasn't ready to back his party's nominee, citing policy differences.\nMcConnell nevertheless signaled that he would not be a rubber stamp for Trump's agenda. Asked if he would draft legislation on Trump's behalf over a \ntemporary ban of Muslims\n from entering the U.S., a signature Trump proposal, McConnell said: \"I'd say no.\"\nAsked if he was worried whether Trump would have a negative effect on down-ballot races, including Senate candidates, McConnell predicted that 2016 would be a \"ticket-splitting election\" where Americans choose different candidates for the Senate and the White House. And there's one Republican senator he's hoping in particular will return next year: Marco Rubio.\n\"I hope he will be drafted.

With 11 million undocumented people, it is very clear to me that we have a broken immigration system.\"\nHe restated his disagreement with the Obama administration's practice of deporting people in a way that splits families across borders.\nWhen the floor was opened to comments, audience members shared stories of high asthma rates and children born with birth defects because of contaminated groundwater.\n\"You can go throughout the valley and there is contamination. You have to buy bottled water to be a little bit safer,\" one man said.\nSanders drew parallels between a visit to Flint, Michigan, in March and the stories he was hearing months later in California, saying he has learned so much since he started running for president.\n\"I think what I am learning and what the American people are not hearing is that this water crisis goes way beyond Flint. People should not be paying for poisoned water.\"\nBefore the meeting concluded, a professor from California State University in Bakersfield asked Sanders if he would endorse the boycott of produce company Driscoll products, a campaign organized in Washington by Familias Unidas por la Justicia to help undocumented workers who the professor said are being paid $6 a day for their labor.\nThough Sanders said he had not heard of the boycott, he expressed outrage at the low wages and added that \"Driscoll would hear from me.\"\nShortly after the community conversation in Bakersfield, Sanders was introduced by  David Villarino, son-in-law of Cesar Chavez, who said that were Chavez still alive, he would certainly be a Sanders supporter.\nOn Sunday, Sanders stopped at The Forty Acres, a national park in Delano, California, where Chavez first organized farmworkers for better labor conditions in the 1960s. Sanders took a tour of the buildings with Federico Chavez, a nephew of the late activist.\nThe two walked around under the scorching sun as Chavez pointed out the old health clinic and the first national headquarters of the United Farm Workers of America in the Reuther Hall on site.\nChavez, a Sanders supporter and volunteer, said, \"it's an honor to have Bernie Sanders here to pay homage to the work that the farmworkers did in establishing Forty Acres here and to recognize the suffering of farm workers.\"\nHe talked about the visit Sen. Robert Kennedy paid to his uncle to break his fast in 1968, while Sanders nodded his head in recognition.\nCalling it a \"very historical location,\" Sanders said that while progress has been made, in his opinion a lot more work needs to be done. He was also quick to lay blame for the conditions he had heard about.\n\"I think that when workers are paid horrendously low wages, when they are exposed to pesticides and the water coming out of the tap is undrinkable, the people who have to be held responsible are the corporations who own the farms and the corporations who buy the products from the farms.\" \nHe said there was \"no question to my mind that workers here and in the valley are being exploited as are farm workers all over this country.\"\nBefore he met privately with Chavez, Sanders was asked if he thought guest worker programs, a bill he has voted against as a senator, were influencing the wages in California.\nSanders said his stops around the central valley did not make him reconsider guest worker programs, adding, \"Well, the guest worker program's a complicated issue and we'll want to talk about more of it.

", "City plans to fight heroin \u2014 by allowing it": "Suffering from the drug epidemic isn't what sets Ithaca apart. It's how their mayor wants to deal with it that makes Ithaca unique. \nThe city is nestled along the southern shores of Lake Cayuga and consistently recognized as a great place to live in United States. Home to three colleges, it's one of the nation's \"Smartest Cities\" and boasts low rates of unemployment. But since 2005, eleven people here have died here from opioid overdoses. Seven of those occurred in the past two years. And in a one-month stretch this spring, four Ithaca residents lost their lives.\nCNN special coverage: addiction\nIn response, Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick has proposed launching a program that has never been legally attempted in the United States: Giving addicts a clean and safe place in the city to use heroin in town.\n\"The first time I heard it, it sounded like we were just enabling people to do drugs,\" Myrick said in an interview with CNN in his downtown office. \"But the truth is, in the places where it has worked, more people get off of drugs.\"\nThe first legal \"supervised injection site\" opened in Bern, Switzerland, in 1986, and others have since sprung up throughout Europe and in Australia and Canada. The facilities provide access to clean needles and other supplies involved in heroin use untainted by diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C. Users consume the drugs in the presence of a professional trained in treating overdoses, and others who can provide referrals and access to treatment programs. Supporters say this is a superior way to keep dirty needles out of the community and bring addicts out of the shadows. \nThe idea was just one of many that Ithaca's city government proposed as part of a municipal plan to combat drug abuse, the culmination of a two-year study that included participation from city leaders, social workers, drug policy reform experts, law enforcement, recovering addicts and focus groups involving members of the community.\nIthaca's movement on this issue comes at a time when policymakers are changing attitudes toward tackling drugs. Opioid overdose is the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States. The dire problem has prompted President Obama to expand federal treatment programs. In March the Senate passed a sweeping bill to address addiction problems and the House passed a slew of bills related to the issue in May. And it has played a significant role in both party's presidential nomination contests, with almost all candidates weighing in. \nRelated: Fentanyl is the new heroin, but deadlier\nBut Ithaca's leaders say they're tired of waiting for a federal response. \n\"The state and federal government have failed. They failed,\" Myrick said. \"We needed a solution because we are tired, I am tired of waiting. I'm living a nightmare. Too many brothers and sisters are dying. I just didn't want to wait.\"\nThe plan revolves around three focused pillars: Prevention, treatment and harm reduction, and stands as a stark alternative to the way the United States has traditionally responded to drug abuse.\nOn the question of building a supervised injection site, however, Myrick will have to wait. Heroin is still illegal, and while other American cities have considered launching similar programs without a state or federal blessing, Ithaca won't proceed without state authorization. New York State Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, a Democrat from Manhattan, plans to introduce a bill to make such sites legal statewide, which would pave the way for Ithaca. \nAlthough a broad group of Ithaca officials were involved in the overall plan, some\u2014including the chief of the city's police department\u2014haven't endorsed every proposal, including the idea of a supervised injection site. \n\"I am a law enforcement officer. I took an oath to uphold the law and right now under the law heroin is considered an illegal substance,\" said Ithaca Police Chief John Barber. \"So I'm not going to condone the use of heroin whether it's in a facility or not. If it's allowable under the law then so be it, we will conform with the law, but currently it just isn't.\"\nBarber still considers himself an ally of Merrick and supports the spirit of a drug initiative that treats the problem like a health issue instead of a criminal one. Every officer, for example, is trained in the administration of Narcan, an opiate antidote that combats overdoses. \n\"At this point law enforcement isn't really equipped to do much more than in effect arrest and put people into the criminal justice system,\" Barber said. \"This really is a medical crisis. It's a crisis that I don't believe we can arrest our way out of.\"", "Mr. President, we need a new DNC chair": "He needs to call Debbie Wasserman Schultz and request that for the good of Democratic Party unity and to best Donald Trump in November, she step aside.\nIt is clear that the Democratic Party is headed for a tumultuous convention, one in which advocates for two very different visions of what the party should stand for will wrestle to try to shape its platform -- not to mention nominate our standard bearer. In this process, we will need to look up to the podium to see a leader who can rise above the fray to inspire confidence on both sides. Wasserman Schultz does not meet that standard.\nAs an individual, Wasserman Schultz has every right to support a candidate. However, the position of Democratic National Committee chair requires resolute neutrality, both in perception and in practice. Yet at major milestones in the primary race, Wasserman Schultz's actions have been anything but neutral -- to the extreme detriment of the party.\nLet's start with the debate schedule. You would think that, given the Republicans' chaotic scrum of sniping candidates, the DNC chair would gleefully schedule a large number of debates to reach the widest audience with essentially free promotion of a slate of thoughtful candidates. Instead, Wasserman Schultz, without seeking broad input from her vice chairs, limited the number of debates to six.\n \nEven though three were later added, by contrast, the party had 15 primary debates in 2004 and 25 debates in 2008.\nThere was an obvious appetite among voters to hear from the Democratic candidates. Despite being held on the night of a crucial Major League Baseball playoff game, the first debate, on CNN, \naveraged 15.8 million total viewers\n, the sixth-biggest nonsports cable telecast in history, with the 25-54 demographic averaging 5 million viewers -- the most ever for a Democratic debate.\nSo why have so few debates? It's important to note that, when the campaign began, no one had assumed the race would boil down to a head-to-head matchup between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. So, by putting her finger on the scale and scheduling fewer debates, Wasserman Schultz was trying to limit the exposure of anyone opposing Clinton, her favored candidate.\nThen, in December, the party's data files were breached, and a staffer of the Sanders campaign accessed Clinton campaign data files. The Sanders campaign immediately terminated the staffer and reiterated to the DNC that its data vendor's firewall security was deeply flawed. Rather than bring the two campaigns together for a review of security, Wasserman Schultz immediately blocked the Sanders campaign's access to its own data, crippling efforts to reach voters at a key moment in the race.\nAnd now, the DNC chair has again poisoned the well. Immediately after the Nevada state convention, Wasserman Schultz went on national television, \naccusing\n the Sanders campaign of fomenting \"violence\" at the event. There was no violence; rather, there was a wild outbreak of people exercising their First Amendment rights by shouting and waving signs. An unbiased chair would have asked for a full report of the convention events -- which would have included looking at the core issue of whether 64 of Sanders' delegates were improperly denied their vote -- before making this kind of slanderous statement.\nTaken together, these incidents underscore the bottom line that Wasserman Schultz has squandered the most important asset a DNC chair must have: trust. She has abused the trust of the campaigns and is a significant contributor to the feeling among many Sanders supporters -- whom we need in November to defeat Trump -- that the DNC has not played fair. And because a leader reflects on her colleagues, her behavior has also tarred other very good DNC activists and leaders.\nNot to mention: Wasserman Schultz has also been a failure leading Democrats in elections. With the exception of the White House, Democrats are now weaker at every level during her tenure. Republicans control the House of Representatives, with the biggest GOP caucus since 1947 when Harry Truman was President; we've lost a dozen U.S. Senate seats, and Republicans now control 67 state legislative chambers, with 24 states under full Republican control.\nA number of strong leaders stand ready to replace Wasserman Schultz without disruption. I believe that any of the current vice chairs -- R.T. Rybak, Maria Elena Durazo, Donna Brazile or Raymond Buckley -- could be steadfastly fair and serve in the interim to chair the convention, alone or as co-chairs. And theirs would be a short service since, by tradition, the party's nominee can install a DNC chair of his or her choosing.\nWe can't wait to make this change. We need a strong and fair DNC leader who will put the party in the best position to defeat Donald Trump and the Republican Party.\nMr. President, make the call. \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.", "How a golf caddie became Trump's campaign confidant": "The visitor was business mogul Donald Trump, who, at that time in 1990, was famous as a flashy real estate developer, not a politician. The course where Scavino worked was heading into foreclosure, and Trump was in the market for expanding his golf business. Scavino, a lucky 16-year-old who happened to be in the right place at the right time, was selected caddie for Trump's party. He was instantly smitten. \nNo one will ever believe this at school on Monday\n, he thought. \nThat day on the course with Trump would eventually set him on a career path with the mogul's growing empire and, years later, place him squarely into Trump's inner circle. In his late 20s, Scavino was promoted to general manager of Trump National Golf Club at the same course where he started as a caddie. He would travel the world with Trump visiting course and he appeared on a golf-themed episode of \"The Apprentice.\" \nIn February, Trump tapped Scavino, now in his 40s, to direct the rapidly growing social media operation for his presidential campaign, putting him at the tip of the spear of Trump's unwieldy\u2014and controversial--communication strategy. Scavino has largely remained in the background of the campaign, but he sat down with CNN for an in-depth interview at the Trump National Golf Club in Hudson Valley where he provided an exclusive look at life within Trump's inner circle and described Trump's unorthodox media strategies. \nIn many ways, Scavino is a near-perfect walking example of a Trump insider. With his slicked hair, custom suits and solid-color ties, he wears the unofficial uniform of Trump's devoted campaign workers. Posts on his own personal Facebook and Twitter pages reveal a man wholly devoted to Trump, a signature calling card of the early adopters of his presidential campaign.\nTrump on Twitter \nMuch like his boss' campaign, there's nothing traditional about Trump's approach to social media. His Twitter account, full of random musings, exclamation points, shoot-from-the-hip insults and grammar mistakes, is an unvarnished extension of his public persona. His posts, which can change the course of entire news cycles, break just about every campaign rule. While the previous Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, had a team of more than 20 advisers reviewing every tweet, Trump's musings often come unfiltered, straight from the source. Scavino often only hears about them after they're posted through an alert on his phone. \n\"He doesn't run anything by me,\" Scavino told CNN. \"We're a different campaign.\" \nWhen the candidate works from Trump Tower in New York, Scavino said, he usually dictates his tweets to staff members who sit near his office.\n\"When he wants to get something out, he'll dictate it out to the girls,\" Scavino said. \nOut on the campaign trail, Scavino himself will take the dictation and post it for him.  \nThis approach is perhaps both a source of Trump's success and a weakness. Supporters find it refreshingly authentic in a world of otherwise sanitized presidential operations, but Trump's posts are often tainted by spelling and grammar mistakes\u2014like when he called rival Marco Rubio a \"leightweight chocker\" instead of a \"lightweight choker.\" Other insults go too far, or include embarrassing errors, such as when his account posted an image of what was supposed to be a U.S. soldier in front of an American flag, but was actually a photo of re-enactors in German Nazi military uniforms, although that particular incident occurred before Scavino joined the campaign.\nBut it is in the evening hours, after \"the girls\" in Trump Tower have gone home for the day or Trump is in his hotel room on the road that his account takes on something of a different life. It is then, Scavino said, when Trump, alone with his phone, thanks supporters by retweeting their praise and comments. \nIt's a nice gesture to his fans, to be sure, but fraught with peril. \nAmong Trump's most controversial retweets include nods to supporters of white nationalism, images mocking the looks of a rival's wife and a quote from Benito Mussolini, the founder of Italy's fascist movement. (The Mussolini quote came from a prankster who tricked Trump into posting the quote.) \nWhile his campaign has blamed some mistakes on unnamed \"interns\" -- like when he retweeted an account suggesting that Iowa voters suffered from mental illness for supporting Ben Carson -- Trump does take some responsibility.\n\"It's the retweets that get me in trouble,\" Trump conceded during an April town hall on CNN. \nRegarding the issue of retweeting accounts with histories of supporting white supremacy, Scavino acknowledged that Trump has been made aware of the problem, but defended the practice by insisting that Trump doesn't have time to check on such things before hitting the \"Send\" button. \n\"He's not clicking on peoples' profiles. He doesn't read their bios,\" Scavino said. \"How many people go and check the history of the last 1,000 tweets the guy put out to see what he's saying on other tweets? I don't.\" \nBut what of the account called \"@WhiteGenocideTM\" a Twitter user with a common rallying crying of white supremacists \nin the title\n?\n\"He's aware of it now,\" Scavino said. \"Let's put it this way: He'll see a message. He's not reading the handles, necessarily. A lot of it gets blown out of proportion in my opinion only because here you have a man that wants to communicate with the American people, OK? And he's doing that.\" \nScavino's new role \nDespite Trump's hands-on approach, Scavino stays plenty busy. He travels the country with Trump, and is regularly spotted at rallies filming the crowds for the campaign as part of a live stream or footage that will appear on the campaign Facebook page or on Snapchat. \nBecause he's spent so much time with Trump over the years, Scavino can seamlessly channel him on social media if need be.\n \"I know Mr. Trump's message very clearly, being around him 18 hours a day, traveling around the country,\" he said. \nWhen Trump began to take a serious look at a White House bid in 2014, Scavino was about to launch a communication consulting business. At Eric Trump's wedding in November 2014, Scavino approached Trump and pledged to give up his own plans and join the cause. \n\"I went up to Mr. Trump and told him I will drop everything I am doing to join you on the campaign trail,\" Scavino recalled, a promise he fulfilled the next year when he halted development of the website for his new business and hit the road. \nScavino talks about Trump like a devoted son defends the legacy of a father. As a confidant to a presidential frontrunner, a role that comes with intense media scrutiny and long list of challenges, the job has taken Scavino on an emotional roller coaster as he's watched people call his beloved boss names like, \"racist,\" a \"sniveling coward\" and a \"loser.\"\n\"I take it personal sometimes,\" Scavino said, a sentiment that comes across on his personal social media accounts, which contain passionate defenses of the Trump brand. \"He doesn't deserve a lot of this crap that's being said about him. ... It fires me up. It pisses me off, it really does, because I care about the man and I care about his family.\" \nThat intensity at times has landed Scavino in his own pot of hot water. After the \nNational Enquirer \npublished a story in March accusing Ted Cruz of having affairs -- a charge Cruz vehemently denied and about which no proof has been provided -- Scavino posted a link on his Twitter page to a video suggesting that one of the accused women was in an inappropriate relationship with the Texas senator. Scavino's tweet gave the appearance that members of Trump's campaign were amplifying the story online.\nLike Trump himself, Scavino defended himself by saying he was just making a comment about a supporter's tweet. \n\"Let me make this as clear as I can.  I not once -- not once -- through the days that \nNational Enquirer \npiece was out, tweeted that out, mentioned it, commented on it, OK?,\" he said. \"I get thousands of Tweets at me, too, you know, as well. Hundreds of videos. I commented on a video, just saying, 'Let me guess, that's @realdonaldtrump's fault, too,' because Ted Cruz was blaming everything on Donald Trump, everything. And that's all I did.\"\nOf Trump's many battles with media figures and White House competitors, Scavino insisted that Trump is not the aggressor, but merely defending himself from attacks. \n\"He never attacked anybody in the sense of where he started it. It was always the opposing campaign throwing punches at Donald Trump,\" Scavino said, a claim that while true in some cases, is not entirely factual. \"If you're going to throw punches at Donald Trump, as we've learned from the past 10 months, be prepared.\" \nTrump, of course, invites the scrutiny. His volleys back to those who challenge him almost always escalate feuds instead of deflating them, which is a strategy Trump has relied on to rally media attention for years.  \n\"It has, in some cases,\" made the tone of the campaign uglier, Scavino admits. \"But you know what? Mr. Trump stands up for what he believes in.\"\nWhen asked if there's anything Trump could say or do that would cause Scavino to leave, he replied, \"No.\" \nWhite House dreams\nShould Trump be elected president, Scavino, who's married with children, doesn't plan to return to his normal job. \n\"I always said I wanted to be the White House photographer. I think that would be a really cool job for me,\" Scavino said of what he would do if Trump takes the White House. \"Or maybe I'll run the POTUS Twitter account.\" \nHe would have plenty to tweet about.  "}, "cnn_world": {"The fight to save Cuba's art schools": "\"They are landmarks of modernism and the most outstanding examples of new architecture produced by the Cuban revolution,\" says Norma Barbacci, an architect at the \nWorld Monuments Fund\n overseeing efforts save the Schools. \nAdmired for their serpentine beauty and proud brick and terracotta domes, numerous attempts to restore the schools have been made by the Cuban government and outside parties over the years -- including by locally born ballet star Carlos Acosta. \nBut with the complex now listed on the 2016 World Monuments Watchlist and two of the five schools close to collapse, architects from the World Monuments Fund, the Italian government and Acosta are all hoping the Cuban government can finally find a sustainable way to restore these fading pieces of history before they are lost forever.  \nArchitectural ideals\nIt was a \nfamous game of golf\n on the then Havana Country Club between Castro, and his loyal guerrilla Guevara in 1961 that first breathed life into the schools, according to John Loomis, an architect and academic who has written \na book on the story\n. \n\"Afterwards they were sitting around at the bar, drinking mojitos and discussing the marvelous country club and what a marvelous resource it was and they came up with the idea of making it into a school for the arts,\" he says.\nAlthough Castro scaled back his international visions, in 1961 he commissioned three architects -- Cuban Ricardo Porro, and Italians Vittorio Garatti\u00a0and\u00a0Roberto Gottardi -- to build a National School of Arts to educate Cubans in ballet, modern dance, art, music and drama.\n\"The architects were all very young, they were very idealistic, very communist, they really felt they were building the new utopia and that the future would be theirs,\" says Loomis. \nBourgeois curves\nWork began immediately, with Porro designing the schools of dance and plastic arts, Garatti the schools of ballet and music and Gottardi the school of dramatic arts. \nBut as the \nCuban missile crisis played out\n and the country moved closer to the USSR, the government started to favor utilitarian, Soviet-style architecture, and the curved, sensuous buildings the architects designed came to be viewed as an extravagant, elitist indulgence. \nIn the waters between the U.S. and Cuba lies a long history\nThe three architects also became targets, with the men accused of being \"egocentric bourgeois cultural aristocrats\", according to Loomis. \nFunding was gradually pulled back and the government halted construction completely in 1965, declaring the schools open even though Porro's schools of dance and plastic arts were the only buildings that had been finished. \nLessons were held in the competed structures, but those that were incomplete lacked protection from the elements and began to fall into disrepair. \nThe architects were also vulnerable, and after Porro's home was attacked using 'Santeria', or Cuban voodoo in 1966, he sought exile in Paris. Garatti also left the country in 1974 after being arrested on false accusations of spying, leaving Gottardi alone on the island.\n\"It was very tough, it was very brutal for the architects,\" Loomis says. \nRevolutionary beauty \nAlthough shunned in Cuba, the schools attracted international attention in 1999 after Loomis' published his book, \"\nA Revolution of Forms\n\", and revealed the unique architecture of the schools to a broad audience. \n\"They are unlike anything you've ever seen before ... so kinetic and organic and three dimensionally complex,\" he says. \n\"You can't really see your destination and you can't turn around and look back and see where you've been. You are always on a journey.\"\nA subsequent listing on the 2000 \nWorld Monuments Watch\n also highlighted the schools' plight, and together they drew Castro's attention to the forgotten schools. \nBrutalism, a revival: From cool to crude and back again\nHe eventually ordered a complete rehabilitation and from 2007 to 2009 the schools of dance and plastic arts underwent restoration and the three incomplete schools were stabilized. \nStudent life returned to the two renovated schools, but any further restoration work was terminated in the wake of the global financial crisis and the other buildings were once again abandoned. \nA last chance\nEfforts to revive restoration works since then have yielded little success, despite the Cuban government declaring the complex a National Monument in 2011 and listing it as a potential world heritage site with \nUNESCO\n.\nThe arguments that ensued after Acosta's offer to fund and develop a dance center in the ballet school in 2012 -- some sections of the government accused him of trying to privatize the schools while Garatti bristled at the idea of other architects becoming involved -- are indicative of the problems any plans have faced. \nBarbacci and Loomis say things have improved since and that the Cubans are receptive to ideas that would see the school opened up internationally and provide a sustainable funding base for the future. They also said the rift with Acosta has been patched up. \nIndeed, the Cuban government established a commission at the beginning of 2015 and has asked its members -- which include Cuban government representatives, Loomis, Barbacci, UNESCO, the Italian Ambassador and Acosta -- to work with the Ministry of Culture to guide restoration and develop a plan that would ensure the schools have a sustainable future. \n\"It would be wonderful if the schools end up fulfilling the original vision of Fidel and Che, that they do become international and that paying students end up being part of a sustainable business plan,\" says Loomis.\nHowever, for all the optimism, the World Monument Fund has again added the complex to its 2016 list of the world's heritage sites that are most at risk and Barbacci says that with the schools of ballet and music about to collapse time is finally running out.  \n\"Each year the site becomes a bit less architecture and a bit more romantic ruin, until at some point there will be nothing to preserve,\" she says.

She's also just 11 years old.\nThis advertisement -- a screengrab from an online marketplace used by ISIS fighters to barter for sex slaves -- is one of many Abdullah Shrem keeps in his phone.\nEach offers vital clues -- photographs, locations -- that he hopes will help him save Yazidi girls and young women like this girl from the militants holding them captive.\nShrem was a successful businessman with trade connections to Aleppo in Syria when ISIS came and kidnapped more than 50 members of his family from Iraq's Sinjar province, a handful of the thousands of Yazidis seized there in 2014.\nTens of thousands of Yazidis fled their homes and clambered up Mount Sinjar in an attempt to escape the fighters; hundreds were massacred, while thousands of women and girls were abducted and sold into slavery.\nSold into sex slavery\nDesperate -- and angered at what he saw as a lack of support from the international community -- he began plotting to save them himself, recruiting cigarette smugglers used to sneaking illicit produce in and out of ISIS territory to help his efforts.\n\"No government or experts trained us,\" he explains when we meet in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. \"We learned by just doing it, over the last year and a half, we gained the experience.\"\nSo far, he says, his network has freed 240 Yazidis; it hasn't been easy, or cheap -- he's almost broke, having spent his savings paying smuggling fees. \nFor those who venture into ISIS territory, the stakes are even higher -- a number of the smugglers have been captured and executed by ISIS while trying to track down Yazidi slaves.\nBut Shrem insists the risks are worth it: \"Whenever I save someone, it gives me strength and it gives me faith to keep going until I have been able to save them all.\"\nIn some cases, the smugglers follow clues in the adverts or other tidbits of information they're able to gather to find the Yazidis. In others, the hostages themselves reach out and plead for help, offering key details as to their location; a province or town they've overheard mentioned, or a local landmark they've been able to spot.\nOnce they manage to make contact, the prisoners are told when and where to go to meet the smugglers who wait for them in a nearby car. Depending on the circumstances of the rescue, it can take days or even weeks to get safely out of ISIS territory, switching from vehicle to vehicle, and waiting in safe houses.\nChildren as bomb-makers\nDileen (not her real name) is one of those rescued by Shrem and his team of smugglers.\nShe was separated from her husband when ISIS militants overran Sinjar province. The last time she saw him he was being marched away, hands up, with the other men from their village.\nShe and her children were taken to Mosul with the women and girls. \"They separated the ones who were really pretty, and made us remove our headscarves to see the prettiest ones,\" she says.\nThey were moved from place to place within ISIS territory: Mosul, Tal Afar, Raqqa, and finally to Tishrin, where, she says, she was sold to an ISIS fighter, who raped her repeatedly.   \n\"They forced me, and they threatened my children,\" she says, recalling the five months she spent trapped in his home.\nISIS claims the Quran justifies taking non-Muslim women and girls captive, and permits their rape -- a claim vociferously denied by Islamic scholars.\nWhile Dileen was used as a sex slave, her daughter Aisha (not her real name), who is just seven years old, was forced to work late into the night, in the basement of their apartment building, assembling IEDs for ISIS.\n\"I used to make bombs,\" says Aisha, quietly, playing with her hair. \"There was a girl my age and her mother. They threatened to kill [the girl] if I wouldn't go and work with them,\" she told CNN. \n\"They would dress us in all black and there was a yellow material and sugar and a powder, and we would weigh them on a scale and then we would heat them and pack the artillery.\"\nAn ISIS militant, she says, would then add the detonation wires.\nEscapees 'can't forget'\nDileen was terrified Aisha would be blown up, or that -- if the family was still being held captive by her next birthday -- she too would be sold as a sex slave. So when the ISIS fighter she now belonged to left to go on a military operation, she spotted a chance to escape. She called Shrem and asked him to help them flee.\n\"We got to a phone with the help of another woman; we got in touch with Abdullah.\"\nShrem's phone number -- memorized by his relatives before their phones were confiscated by ISIS --  has been passed around among captured Yazidis, who know he will help them if he can.\n\"I begged him to hurry up and get us before my daughter turned eight, because they would take her.\"\nShrem told her to meet someone from his network at a nearby mosque the following day, then spirited her and her children out of ISIS territory.\nA year on from their rescue, Dileen -- now living in a refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan -- says she is still haunted by what they went through: \"I can't forget what happened.\"\nHer husband is still missing, feared dead, but Dileen insists that \"for my children, I have to survive.\"\nPlea for international action\nShrem's own sister is another of those victims, who managed to get in touch with him from behind enemy lines.\n\"For eight months, I didn't hear anything from her,\" he recalls. \"Then she called me from Anbar.\n\"There was a wife of an ISIS fighter who gave her a phone and said, 'Maybe you will be able to save yourself.'\"\nShe was able to give him a vague description of her surroundings; eventually he was able to pinpoint her location and get a message to her.\nHe saved her and her youngest son, five-year-old Saif, but so far hasn't been able to trace her two eldest sons, who were sent to ISIS training camps, or her 13-year-old daughter, who was taken away to be sold.\nThousands of Yazidis remain trapped inside ISIS territory, and Shrem fears time may be running out to save many of them from radicalization. He is calling on the international community to take action.\n\"If it was 50 and not 5,000 Europeans that were being raped every day by ISIS, would Europe stay silent? Of course not. There would be operations ... everything would be done to save them.\n\"But 5,000 Yazidis being raped, the children trained and turned into walking bombs, and no one does anything. We are abandoned.\"\nBrainwashed by ISIS\nMonths on from his rescue, Saif still shows the after-effects of months of ISIS brainwashing.\n\"When Saif first got out, he was like a wild thing,\" Shrem recalls. \"We couldn't really talk to him. He was still applying the ISIS mentality -- that everyone is the enemy.\n\"The ISIS fighters would take him to Sharia school ... they would teach him that jihad was the best thing in life.\"\nWhen Shrem asks what he'd rather play with, a ball or a gun, he doesn't hesitate: \"A gun,\" he insists.\n\"They put this in their heads,\" Shrem says, sadly. \"That there is nothing better than a gun.\"\nTrained to kill 'infidels'\nFellow ISIS captive Dilshad, aged 10, underwent the same brainwashing. His mother Samira (not her real name) says he was being groomed to be an ISIS executioner.\nWhile his mother and siblings were held captive, he was taken to an ISIS training camp.\n\"They said, 'We are going to the camp to train to fight with the Islamic state,' [there were] little and big children [there],\" Dilshad explains.\n\"We were running and we read the Fatiha [the first chapter of the Quran] and they wouldn't let us drink water. They said it was so you can be trained.\"\nSamira was horrified when she overheard the family's captors talking about the promise Dilshad showed. Weeks later, they were sold to another militant. It was Dilshad he wanted.\n\"[He] was a butcher, he would kill people, he would slaughter them,\" Dilshad remembers. \"He said, 'now you kill them with a pistol,' but I said 'I can't kill.'\n\"He said 'OK, next time you will kill them.' I said 'Why are you killing people in front of me?' He said 'So you learn.' He killed people with a sword... he said they are infidels.\n\"The first time I saw them kill in front of me I was very scared, but then I wasn't as scared as the first time.\"\nDilshad says the ISIS militant told him he was like a son, and urged him to kill members of his real family: \"They said to me, 'your father is an infidel, if you see him kill him.'\"\nRadicalized teens 'nuclear bombs'\nSamira says that, over time, her son grew attached to the executioner.\n\"My son didn't threaten us, but he asked me 'What would you think if I kill?' I burst into tears. I said 'How can you kill innocents?'\n\"I couldn't stop crying; he hugged me and said 'I won't kill anyone, I will listen to you.\"\nAfter more than a year in captivity, Samira and her family were rescued before ISIS militants could turn Dilshad into a killer.\nSaif and Dilshad are the lucky ones -- they are safely out of ISIS hands -- but many others, including Saif's brothers, remain inside their territory.\nEvery family has someone who is missing, presumed dead, and there is little or no psychological support for those who have managed to get out.\n\"What I am most worried about are those who finished the Sharia [school] and the training, they are fully brainwashed,\" says Shrem.\n\"I consider each of them to be a nuclear bomb that will come and target the Yazidis.\"", "Ancient Roman text discovered at London building site": "But archeologists say they're some of the oldest handwritten documents ever found in Britain -- and they include the first known reference to

central London site will soon be home to Bloomberg's new European headquarters, but the construction phase has  revealed a treasure trove of Roman relics.\nLondon dig turns up slice of London life \nAlong with hundreds of writing tablets, archaeologists have also found evidence of more than 50 Roman buildings and 15,000 other artifacts at the site. \nDocumenting Roman London \nThe tablets include a financial document dating back to January 8, 57 A.D. -- the earliest handwritten text ever found in the UK.\nAnother tablet features the address \"Londinio Mogontio,\" meaning \"In London, to Mogontius.\" Dated between 65 A.D. and 80 A.D., it is believed to be the earliest ever reference to London.\nAmong the tablets are the names of almost 100 people -- from slaves to judges and even

beeswax for people to write on.\nOver thousands of years the wax has disintegrated, but the wood remains -- and on it, the indentation of people's handwriting.\nLuckily, the wood was encased in wet mud from the then-Walbrook river, which prevented oxygen from eroding the tablets.\nAs tablets were often reused, numerous layers of writing could be seen indented in the wood -- making the task of decoding the text particularly challenging.\nAncient codebreakers \nDr. Roger Tomlin, a lecturer in Roman history at Oxford University and an expert in Latin cursive writing, used a mixture of photography, raking light technology and microscopic analysis to decipher the text.\n\"I am so lucky to be the first person to read them again after more than 19 centuries, and to imagine what these

handwoven kilim rugs and original Turkish artwork.\nIt's located in the heart of the Old City, steps away from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace. \nMystique (Santorini, Greece)\nThough it's hard to find a poor view in Santorini, Mystique has the most Instagram-worthy vista around thanks to its lofty perch on the rim of the caldera, on the southernmost tip of Oia.\nFrom the hotel's infinity pool, guests can soak in an unrivaled panorama of Santorini's dramatic volcanic cliffs and the glittering southern Aegean Sea.\nThe airy, free-form rooms are carved directly into the cliff and feature private, ocean-facing terraces.\nThe highlight of the property is its pool bar, Aura, which serves up cocktails to match the showstopping sunsets.\nThe Peninsula Paris (Paris)\nOpened in 2015 after a four-year, $850-million transformation, the Peninsula Paris proved worth the wait. \nIt was once the Hotel Majestic, where George Gershwin penned \"An American in Paris\" in 1928. \nThe building's sculpted stone facade -- covered in intricate bas-reliefs -- was meticulously restored to its former neoclassical splendor.\nInside are similarly restored marble, gilt work and 19th-century mosaics, which complement the hotel's modern artwork and fixtures.\nThere are 200 bright, spacious rooms, a 19,000-square-foot spa and a sleek indoor swimming pool.\nBut what everyone's really here for is the rooftop restaurant, L'Oiseau Blanc, with its sweeping 360-degree views over the entire city.\nMORE: World's best luxury dive resorts\nCliveden House (Berkshire, England)\nThough it's just an hour's drive from London, Cliveden House feels worlds away, flanked by acres of thick woodland and rolling countryside.\nBuilt in the 1850s in a blend of English Palladian and Roman Cinquecento architectural styles, it looks and feels more like a grand private home than a hotel.\nThere are just 38 rooms and suites, each named after a figure from the house's past -- Henry James, Lady Astor, The Prince of Wales -- and individually furnished to match.\nOutside, there's a historic maze, a heated pool within a walled garden and a magnificent 17th-century parterre formal garden.\nMORE: The Middle East's most luxurious hotel rooms\nAshford Castle (Cong, Ireland)\nReopened in March 2015 after a year-long renovation, Ireland's oldest castle -- built in 1228 -- also doubles as one of its most beautiful and beloved hotels. \nIt's unsurprisingly grandiose, decked out in Connemara marble and adorned with brocade silk, crystal chandeliers and antiques.\nIts 82 rooms are individually furnished, though most have four-poster beds, fireplaces and claw-foot tubs.\nThough the castle is a destination in and of itself, it's also conveniently located on the picturesque shores of Lough Corrib, Ireland's second largest lake.\nFour Seasons Hotel Firenze (Florence, Italy)\nThe Four Seasons in Florence feels more like a sprawling Tuscan country estate than a hotel in the heart of a bustling metropolis.\nFor starters, it's built within Giardino della Gherardesca -- Florence's largest private garden, spanning 11 acres.\nThe hotel consists of two separate Renaissance palazzi: the 15th-century Palazzo della Gherardesca and 16th-century La Villa (a former convent).\nBetween the two, there are 116 rooms and suites, most of which feature original frescoes, bas-reliefs and stuccoes.\nThe Della Gherardesca Royal Suite spans 25,000 square feet and has original 18th-century majolica floors by artist Ignazio Chiaiese.\nBela Vista Hotel & Spa (Algarve, Portugal)\nLocated on the pristine beachfront at Praia da Rocha, Bela Vista was the first hotel to open on the Algarve, back in 1934.\nThough it's since been joined by dozens of other high-end lodgings, its eclectic charm and intimate boutique feel keeps it above the rest.\nThe hotel's original decor -- painted wooden ceilings and colorful wall mosaics -- has been kept intact through a recent refurbishment that's outfitted the property with modern updates and chic, bold furnishings.\nThe highlight of the hotel is without doubt its outdoor freshwater pool, which is flanked by palm trees and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. \nMORE: 11 of the world's most luxurious train journeys\nHotel d'Angleterre (Geneva)\nSituated on the banks of Lake Geneva facing the Jet d'Eau fountain, this family-run hotel is a

rooms decorated with antiques, rich fabrics and original artwork.\nIts aptly named signature restaurant, Windows, features floor-to-ceiling panes of glass and overlooks Lake Geneva.\nTrianon Palace Versailles (Versailles, France)\nSet in an ornate Belle Epoque-style building built in 1909, Trianon Palace is impressive from the outset.\nIt's flanked by manicured gardens and situated inside a three-acre wooded park, just 30 minutes from Paris.\nBut it's more than just a pretty face. \nInside are 199 plush rooms outfitted with fireplaces and terraces, as well as a two-Michelin-starred restaurant, Gordon Ramsay au Trianon.\nThe best part? \nTrianon Palace is built right on the doorstep of the Versailles gardens and within walking distance of the Palace of Versailles.\nSchloss Fuschl (Fuschlsee-Salzburg, Austria)\nSet in a 15th-century hunting lodge on the densely wooded peninsula of an alpine lake, Schloss Fuschl comes complete with fairy tale vibe.\nThe romantic resort has 110 rooms and suites, including six lakeside cottages perched on the lake shore, each with its own private sauna, terrace and fireplace.\nMuch like the resort itself, decor is grand yet intimate.\nThere are Renaissance-inspired antiques paired with comfy armchairs and wood-burning fireplaces.\nClose by is Lake Fuschl, where the resort's private jetty provides the launch point for a wooden boat ride or swim.\nBlue Palace (Crete, Greece)\nThe striking simplicity of this low-rise, whitewashed resort proves that beauty doesn't necessarily equal opulence.\nIts 256 rooms are bright, minimalist and bohemian, allowing luxe touches like the ocean-facing terraces and private plunge pools to shine.\nClay roof tiles, wooden shutters and pebble mosaics add to the property's low-key charm, while palms and olive-tree-filled gardens help it blend into the wild landscape.\nFrom the main pool, guests can enjoy breathtaking views over the Cretan Sea and the island of Spinalonga.\nSchloss Elmau Retreat (Elmau, Germany)\nIt's hard to get more secluded than this: Schloss Elmau is placed inside a green valley at the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, flanked on all sides by thick forest.\nIn fact, it was founded in 1916 by philosopher Johannes Mueller as a sanctuary for artists and creatives looking to escape the \"outside world.\"\nComprising two separate hotels, aptly named Hideaway and Retreat, the resort is grand yet cozy, thanks to thoughtful, globally curated decor -- carpets from Iran, linen from India, tables from Indonesia -- and a warm, inviting color palette.\nIn winter, the entire resort transforms into a snowy wonderland.\nMORE: Six of the world's most exclusive yacht charters\nFour Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace (Budapest)\nWith its two-million-piece mosaic tiled floor, 19th-century stained glass roof panels and intricate ironwork, the Four Seasons in Budapest is an art nouveau masterpiece.\nThe lobby is a work of art in and of itself, with its Moorish glass-domed ceiling and dazzling spiked-glass chandelier.\nRooms are spacious and luxe with vaulted ceilings and marble bathrooms; many are outfitted with private balconies overlooking the Danube or Buda Castle.\nIt sits at the base of the Chain Bridge, within easy walking distance of the Castle District on the opposite side of the river.\nMORE: British Columbia's best luxury lodges\nLe Sirenuse,

overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nIts 60 majolica-tiled rooms are thoughtfully decorated with handpicked antiques and feature vaulted ceilings, French doors and private terraces.\nThe hotel's alfresco bar, Franco's, is a new addition to the grande dame hotel with its quirky decor and unmatched coastal views.\nBelmond La Residencia (Mallorca, Spain)\nIn the foothills of the Serra de Tramuntana on Mallorca's beautiful northwest coast, La Residencia is perfectly situated between the mountains and the Mediterranean.\nMade up of several 16th-century farmhouses sprawled across the hillside, the hotel's local stonework and cantilevered gardens blend seamlessly into the mountainous landscape.\nInside, dark wood furniture and wood-beam ceilings offset the whitewashed walls and understated natural tones. \nIts 67 rooms are decorated in traditional Mallorcan style with terracotta tile floors and canopied, hand-carved beds.\nHighlights of the property include its sculpture garden -- a nod to the area's artistic heritage -- and its two freshwater swimming pools.\nVilla Gallici (Aix-en-Provence, France)\nSituated in a dense cypress tree forest just north of the Old Town, this 18th-century Provencal villa is the ultimate French countryside escape.\nIts 22 rooms are decorated with antiques, four-poster beds, rich tapestries and hand-painted Chinoiserie wallpaper.\nCommon areas are similarly lavish, blending old-world Provencal opulence with French Colonial elements.\nOutside is a leafy seven-acre garden centered around a beautiful swimming pool where guests do dinner and cocktails.\n \nMandarin Oriental Prague (Prague)\nIn the quiet, cobblestoned Mala Strana district, this Gothic-Baroque beauty feels like an urban oasis hidden in plain sight.\nA 14th-century monastery, the hotel blends original architectural features with contemporary touches.\nIts 99 rooms feature vaulted ceilings, parquet floors and views of either the old monastery courtyard or Prague

Manor (Sussex, England)\nBuilt in 1598, this stately Elizabethan manor was the former home of pioneering gardener William Robinson, considered the father of the English natural garden.\nSo it comes as no surprise that Gravetye Manor is bordered by the most enchanting and colorful wild gardens in Sussex, created by Robinson himself.\nThere's lots to admire inside, too, from the 16th-century art to the grand fireplaces that burn in the sitting rooms. \nThrow in a wood-paneled, Michelin-starred restaurant and sweeping countryside views, and you've got the perfect English countryside retreat.\nHotel Savoy (Florence, Italy)\nLocated steps from the Duomo and overlooking lively Piazza della Repubblica, the Hotel Savoy occupies the best address in the city.\nIts aristocratic, 19th-century facade belies its whimsical modern interiors -- a pleasant surprise in a city dominated by posh Renaissance-era hotels.\nIts 102 rooms are brightly decorated with fashion-inspired art by local artists and bookshelves stuffed with literary classics. \nMany have small balconies overlooking the piazza.\nThe hotel's sixth-floor gym has excellent views of the Duomo and Campanile.", "Sutter: Is slavery finally ending here?": "For only the second time in the country's history, a judge in Mauritania this week convicted two people on charges of slavery, \naccording to anti-slavery activists\n and U.S. officials. \nSlavery is thought to be more common in that West African country, which \nCNN featured in the 2012 documentary \"Slavery's Last Stronghold,\"\n than anywhere else on Earth. According to a report from the Walk Free Foundation, \nan estimated 4% of Mauritanians -- 155,600 people\n -- live in modern slavery. \n\"This is a significant development,\" the U.S. ambassador to Mauritania, Larry Andre, said of the convictions. \"It sends a clear message to people who deny freedom to others risk losing their own.\"\nMauritanian officials long have denied modern slavery exists in the country. This week's convictions provide new evidence not only that slavery continues but that some factions of the government finally are willing to do something it, said Sarah Mathewson, Africa program coordinator for Anti-Slavery International. \n\"Lots of people (in Mauritania) will be very encouraged by this ruling -- encouraged to leave slavery, encouraged to access justice,\" she said. \"And slave owners will be discouraged from continuing to abuse them.\"\n\"It's unbelievable,\" she said. \"It keeps dawning on me.\"\nOn Monday a special slavery court in Nema, Mauritania, convicted two people on charges of owning two women as slaves from birth, according to a press release from Anti-Slavery International, which brought the lawsuit with SOS Esclaves, a local anti-slavery group. \n\"The slave owners convicted yesterday come from a highly influential and powerful family,\" that London-based organization said in a statement. \"A full public hearing was held, with the masters held to account before one of their former slaves.\"\nCourt documents for the case were not immediately available. \nThe U.S. Embassy in Nouakchott, the Mauritanian capital, confirmed the convictions for CNN, saying the slave owners were sentenced to 5 years in prison and a 1 million ouguiya ($2,800) fine. A local official from the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also confirmed the convictions had taken place.\nThe men are likely to serve only one year of the sentence, according to Anti-Slavery International.\n\"One year is a short period of time, of course,\" said Gulnara Shahinian, the former U.N. special rapporteur on modern slavery, who has visited Mauritania five times. \"I understand this. But, again, I take this as an important step. I don't want to be pessimistic.\"\n\"We need to all congratulate Mauritania for doing this -- but be very cautious,\" she said. \"It's a beginning. And we have to keep our eye on these processes. The country still needs help in order to address human rights issues in the country.\"\nThe convictions mark a hopeful turning point in Mauritania's fight against slavery, Shahinian said.\nSome Mauritanians continue to practice a form of slavery reminiscent of the United States before the Civil War. Black Africans largely are enslaved by lighter skinned Arabs, and some people continue to be born into slavery. They spend their lives working at the hands of masters who own them as property. \nThe two victims in this week's case, who Anti-Slavery International named as Fatimetou Mint Hamdi and Fatimata Mint Zaydih, both in their late 30s or early 40s, escaped slavery with their children last year with the help of SOS Esclaves. \nHamdi participated in the public trial, according to Anti-Slavery International. \"When the masters were denying the charges, she began crying out: 'That's not true, you know what we were to you!'\" the group said in a news release. \n\"I herded their goats from a very young age,\" Zaydih told police, according to excerpted testimony provided to CNN by Anti-Slavery International. \"... [S]ometimes my children and I would go for several days without eating. I never received any money or anything else for the work I did. When I went out with the animals for long periods, my children would remain with the larger family of masters. My 10-year old son became the slave of one of the masters, and was under his control all the time.\"\nLast year, \nMauritania established special courts for hearing slavery cases\n. Activists, who had been trying unsuccessfully for years to get slavery cases prosecuted, initially greeted the courts with skepticism. \nMauritania only criminalized slavery in 2007\n, and \ngovernment officials continue to deny it exists\n. Before this week, only one conviction on slavery charges had been issued -- and that slave owner never served jail time, according to Mathewson. \nBut activists now hope these courts could bring about sweeping changes in the country. An additional eight cases now sit before the special slavery courts, according to Shahinian. \n\"The elements already are in place, but it was necessary to bring all of the elements together to eradicate slavery,\" said Shahinian, the former U.N. special rapporteur. \"This is a very good momentum now.\"\nActivists are urging the government to hear additional slavery cases as soon as possible.\nSeparately, two Mauritanian anti-slavery activists, Biram Dah Abeid and Brahim Ould Bilal, \nwere released from prison this week\n after having been arrested for protesting the continued practice of slavery. \nAfter his release, \nAbeid told Reuters he plans to run for president. \nAdd John D.

But the Human Research Program, which aims to lessen the effects of the space environment on the health and performance of humans, is using the data to make sure they can send astronauts even deeper into the solar system.\nA six-month journey to Mars would only be the beginning of a challenging expedition to land people on the surface of the Red Planet, 140 million miles away. The crew members would then live and work there.\nIn preparation, NASA has been using six-month crew member rotations and Scott Kelly's groundbreaking one-year mission on the ISS to study the effects of space on the human body. So what happens when we have to transition from walking on solid ground to floating in zero gravity?\n\"I felt like I was falling,\" NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins told CNN's Rachel Crane. \"It was as if you're hanging off the rafters in a building and you let go, and that lasted for about 24 hours. My brain was taking a little while to get used to the fact that there was no up and down anymore. And that went away fairly quick. It takes a little while to get used to floating, too. It's almost like learning to walk all over again, a little bit.\"\nHopkins was on the ISS for 166 days, from September 2013 to March 2014. Though the adjustment to microgravity doesn't take long, other issues arise within the first few days due to a phenomenon in which the head tilts downward\n \nbetween 12 and 20 degrees, which causes disorientation.  \n\"As soon as you arrive in weightlessness, the fluids start shifting in your body from the lower part of your body into the upper part of your body,\" said  Dr. John Charles, Human Research Program associate manager for international science. \"Your organs of balance and your inner ear immediately sense there's no gravity pulling down on them anymore.\"\nThis causes something known among astronauts as Bird Leg Syndrome, because the fluid shift causes them to have puffy faces and thin legs. It also makes them less thirsty, dulls their sense of taste and causes a \"stuffy nose\" feeling similar to allergies. Space motion sickness also affects about 79% of astronauts who experience microgravity in the first 24 to 48 hours, creating a loss of appetite, dizziness and vomiting. \nLong-term risks\nHopkins also had to worry about the long-term effects on his body, such as the weakening and loss of bones and atrophying muscles. In space, without gravity, bones lose more than 1% of minerals and density per month. \nAstronauts also experience blood volume loss, weakened immune systems and cardiovascular deconditioning since floating takes little effort and the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood through your body, according to Human Research Program deputy chief scientist Jennifer A. Fogarty.  \nNASA has developed countermeasures to combat these known issues and how they might continue after landing back on Earth. Most involve making sure that astronauts stay healthy by consuming enough nutrients in their meals and supplements, in addition to using three\n \nspecially designed exercise machines on the ISS. \nAs soon as they overcome motion sickness, NASA wants its astronauts to start working out. It's also good for their sensory motor systems if their feet are striking the surface of something, like running on a treadmill, Fogarty said.\nThe three exercise machines\n \nmimic a treadmill, a stationary bike and a multipurpose weight machine. They're meant to stimulate the lower body, from running to squats and dead lifts, as the largest percent of bone loss occurs in the pelvis and femurs. Astronauts use the machines for two hours a day to compensate for the other 22 hours in which they aren't experiencing physical activity. \nIn addition to counteracting bone loss and atrophying muscles, the exercise provides a change of pace and mental release -- even if they have to bungee themselves to the treadmill to run in microgravity. \nBut one of the more recent effects of spaceflight noticed over the past five to seven years centers on eye health.  Kelly and other astronauts in their late 40s and 50s have complained about their vision being slightly altered. Some of them have required glasses in flight.\n\"It changes their visual acuity,\" Charles said. \"They're not able to see things up close. It's like advanced aging. That sort of thing happens at a sort of an accelerated rate.\"\nGiven the connection between the eye, optic nerve and brain, combined with the fluid shift astronauts experience, some research has suggested that the eyes act as a pressure release valve, Fogarty said. But her program has many studies in the works to get to the root of the cause and how to counteract it.\nEven though the ISS sits within Earth's protective magnetic field, astronauts are still exposed to 10 times the radiation that they would be on the ground. NASA monitors radiation exposure, given the fact that ISS crewmembers are considered radiation workers. \nThe agency has been able to limit radiation risks to 1%, but a mission to Mars would expose astronauts to harmful galactic cosmic rays. Without proper shielding, this can increase cancer risk, cause radiation sickness, alter cognitive and motor function, and even lead to cataracts and cardiac and circulatory diseases. \nThe reality of gravity\nAnd then there's landing on the ground again after experiencing zero gravity. Mars mission crew members would need to be able to get to work almost immediately after landing. Even though Mars has only a third of the gravity experienced on Earth, it would still be an adjustment for astronauts after floating for six months.\n\"[It] took a little bit longer to get used to life in gravity again,\" Hopkins said. \"I had some issues with, like, pitching moments. It just felt like if I bent [over], I would fall right on my face. And in microgravity, you lose references to how much things weigh. And so I remember when I first landed and I was laying in the Soyuz [the capsule used for landing] and I was just handing out our flight procedures. And that little book that maybe weighs a pound and a half felt like it weighed 25 or 30 pounds.\" \nBut even though our bodies weren't meant to live in space, the Human Research Program is always researching ways for us to thrive in the final frontier. The current countermeasures used on the ISS, the results of ongoing studies and recently funded proposals aiming to solve issues around human health, will aid astronauts as they push the limits of deep space in the 2020s and 2030s.\n\"Mother Nature always tells you the right answer, but you just have to ask the right question,\" Charles said. \"Our human bodies are up to the challenge of a trip to Mars and back.\"", "Skywatch: Your guide to space": "The sky is full of wonder, and every day, there is something beautiful to see.

Remember, don't look directly at the sun without the proper equipment -- it could damage your eyes. \nNASA offers tips for viewing\n and explains why the transit is important to scientists. NASA also will stream the event live on \nNASA TV\n.\nShare your photos and videos with CNN\n by visiting iReport, or post on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram using the hashtag #CNNSpace. \nIf you have a space event that you think CNN should keep an eye out for, tell us!", "Airlines feud at world's busiest airport": "Here at the world's busiest airport -- with seven concourses and more than 200 gates -- a gate for the Super Jumbo Airbus A380 could not be provided. That forced Qatar Airways passengers to deplane Wednesday via mobile stairs and shuttle buses. \nAtlanta's airport has only one gate that can accommodate the A380 -- the world's largest airliner. The airport and resident hub carrier Delta Air Lines said they could not make that gate available. \nThe very public battle between Delta Air Lines, the world's second largest airline, and competitor Qatar Airways represents a microcosm of the national debate over whether the amount of alleged government subsidies foreign airlines receive violates international Open Skies agreements. \nHundreds of Qatar passengers were inconvenienced in Atlanta. Some wanted to know who to blame for not having a jetway where they could deplane. The airport and Delta blamed the airline for not giving enough notice that it was sending a Super Jumbo to an airport with only one gate that could handle such a big plane. \n\"It is a part of the common use lease agreement that we have,\" said airport spokesman Reese McCranie. \"We have to be given a certain amount of time when there is an equipment swap.\"\nFour to six Delta aircraft needed access to the A380 gate at the time the Qatar Airways plane requested access. \n\"... there wasn't anywhere Delta could put them,\" McCranie added.\nDelta offered as a \"solution\" a scenario that included parking the A380 on a remote stand near the international terminal. \"Despite limited time to solve for the request, Delta offered solutions to allow Qatar to use the gates while ensuring our own schedule remained accommodated during a heavy traffic period at the international terminal,\" Delta said in a written statement. \n\"Delta applies for accommodations months in advance,\" a Delta spokeswoman said. \"Qatar did not do that when asking for the A380.\" The A380 was scheduled for the flight at least a month in advance, according to several widely published reports. \nWhen asked if the airline gave enough notice to schedule access to the gate, Gunter Saurwein, Qatar Airways' vice president for the Americas, smiled and said, \"In general yes, we gave some lead time that we would be here.\" \nWhen asked if Delta may have deliberately prevented Qatar from using the gate, Sawrwein said, \"I do not want to comment on that. We as an airline don't finger point.\" \nThe crew deplaned the double-decker jet's 517 passengers in 45 minutes, including some disabled travelers. Although that's much longer than it usually takes to deplane via a jetway, Sawrwein described it as a success under the circumstances. \nLater, the outbound A380 flight experienced a two hour delay due to the same gate situation. \nUsing the Super Jumbo for this flight was a one-off for Qatar Airways' inaugural, making the gate dilemma unlikely to occur again on this route. Future Qatar Airways flights between Doha and Atlanta are scheduled to use Boeing 777-200LRs, which will have access to an airport gate and jetway. \nU.S. carriers claim that Qatar Airways and other Persian Gulf airlines receive billions of dollars in subsidies and have done so for many years, if not decades. They also allege that government handouts to Gulf carriers have enabled the funding of new routes and new aircraft.\nWhile Delta accuses Qatar of improperly using subsidies to fund new routes, many argue that Qatar offers passengers a higher quality experience at a more competitive price.\nThe feud between the two carriers escalated last March when Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said he'd launched the Atlanta route \"to rub salt into the wounds of Delta.\"", "Asia to make America's Cup history": "It was \nannounced Thursday that Fukuoka\n, Japan, will welcome the World Series on November 18, with organizers hoping the two-day event  will lure a brand new audience to the sport.\nThe series allows teams to pick up qualifying points ahead of next year's Louis Vuitton Cup Challenger races in Bermuda, from which the winner takes on defending champion Oracle Team USA in the battle for the America's Cup.\n\"This is an incredible opportunity to showcase this compelling sport to new audiences, not only in Japan but across all of Asia,\" said Russell Coutts, CEO of the 35th America's Cup and and a five-time winner of sailing's premier competition.\nRead: 'Ditch digger' lands dream America's Cup job\n\"With the challenge from SoftBank Team Japan marking the return of Japan to the America's Cup, enthusiasm is building for the sport in Asia,\" the New Zealander added. \n\"The new, foiling, flying AC45 catamarans produce exciting, exhilarating racing and show our sport at its best.

Some Turkish leaders also fear a genocide acknowledgment could lead to demands for huge reparations.\nMeanwhile, some Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the extent of the killings of their ancestors is acknowledged.\nTurkey has now recalled its ambassador to Germany, in response to the resolution. \nTurkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus \ntweeted:\n \"It is a historic mistake for the German Parliament to accept some 'distorted and unfounded' allegations as 'genocide.'\nWhy Turkey won't say the 'G-word' when it comes to Armenians\n\"German Parliament accepting this resolution is unbecoming of the friendship between Turkey and Germany,\" he continued.\n\"This issue is one that needs to be resolved by people of science and historians, not one to be solved by politicians of parliaments.\"\nNew strain on Germany-Turkey relationship?\nGermany's resolution is likely to place a strain on relations between Berlin and Ankara, and follows a recent migrant deal between Turkey and the European Union, in which Germany plays a central role.\nUnder the deal, for every Syrian refugee returned to Turkey from Greece, a Syrian refugee in Turkey is resettled in the EU. Turkey also agreed to take measures to prevent routes for migration opening from that country to the EU.\nIn turn, the EU could potentially lift its visa requirements for Turkish citizens by the end of June 2016.\nThe EU may also speed up the payment of 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to Turkey to help it deal with the refugee crisis, with potentially billions more on the table. \nTurkey, which borders both Syria and Europe, is already host to 2.6 million migrants. \nEU migrant deal: How will it actually work?\nThe French precedent \nWhat could the fall-out from Germany's genocide resolution look like? \nWhen France passed legislation recognizing the Armenian genocide in 2011, Turkey promptly recalled its ambassador to the country and froze military cooperation between the countries.\nThe ambassador returned the following year, and the election of French President Francois Hollande in 2012 helped usher in a new era of cooperation between the countries. \nWho uses the G-word?\nAs of last year, more than 20 countries around the world have officially recognized the killings of 1915 as a genocide, according to the Armenian National Assembly. These include France, Canada and Russia.\nAmong the countries which do not call the atrocities a genocide are the United States and Britain.\nWhy Obama won't say 'Armenian Genocide'\nWhile a U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the term.\nIn April, Pope Francis referred to the massacre as \"the first genocide of the 20th century\" -- a claim which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described as \"nonsense,\" recalling his country's ambassador to the Vatican.\nIn 2014 Erdogan offered his condolences for the mass killings, which he said had \"inhumane consequences\" -- though the Turkish leader stopped short of using the term \"genocide.\"", "Why they hate us": "In 2014, \nabout 30,000 people were killed in terror attacks worldwide\n. The vast majority of those perpetrating the violence were Muslim but -- and this is important -- so were the victims. Of the some 30,000 dead, the vast, vast majority were Muslims.\nThat's crucial to understand because it sheds light on the question, \"Why do they hate us?\" Islamic terrorists don't just hate America or the West. They hate the modern world, and they particularly hate Muslims who are trying to live in the modern world. \nLet's be clear. While the jihadis are few, there is a larger cancer within the world of Islam -- a cancer of backwardness and extremism and intolerance. \nMost of the countries that have laws that restrict the free exercise of religion are Muslim majority\n, while those that have laws against leaving the faith are Muslim majority. \nBut are these things inherent in the religion?\nWhen experts try to explain that in the 14th century, Islamic civilization was the world's most advanced, or that the Quran was once read as a liberal and progressive document, they're not trying to deny the realities of backwardness today. What they are saying is that it can change.\nIslam, after all, has been around for 14 centuries. There have been periods of war and of peace. Before 1900, for hundreds of years, Jews fled European pogroms and persecution to live in relative peace and security under the Ottoman Caliphate. That's why there were a million Jews in the Muslim Middle East in 1900. Today, Jews and Christians are fleeing from Iraq and Syria and radical Islamists take control of those lands. It's the same religion then and now. So what is different?\nIt's not theology, it's politics. Radical Islam is the product of the broken politics and stagnant economics of Muslim countries. They have found in radical religion an ideology that lets them rail against the modern world, an ideology that is now being exported to alienated young Muslims everywhere -- in Europe, and even in some rare cases in the United States.\nHow can we bring an end to this? \nThere's really only one way: Help the majority of Muslims fight extremists, reform their faith, and modernize their societies. In doing so, we should listen to those on the front lines, many of whom are fighting and dying in the struggle against jihadis. The hundreds of Muslim reformers I've spoken to say their task is made much harder when Western politicians and pundits condemn Islam entirely, demean their faith, and speak of all Muslims as backward and suspect.\nBut here's another way to think about this. In America, African-Americans make up \nabout 13% of the population\n, yet they comprise about 50% of homicide offenders, according to a \nJustice Department study\n. Now we understand -- I hope we understand -- that when we see a black man on the street, we cannot and must not treat him as a likely criminal. It would be dehumanizing, unfair and racist. In America, of all places, people should be treated as individuals and not as stereotypes from a racial, ethnic or religious group. And remember, the Bangladeshi cabdriver who drives you to the airport has nothing, nothing to do with ISIS, even though he is also a Muslim. \nOf course, it is hard not to make these quick associations -- especially in the wake of a terror attack. But if America is about anything, it is the idea that people should be judged as individuals with individual liberties and rights. It is what they hate about us. We might as well live up to our own ideals.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.", "ISIS soldiers rape women 'to make them Muslim'": "Watch Connect the World at 5 p.m. CET this week for detailed reports on Yazidis enslaved by ISIS and their lives now.\n\"Today is the female sex slave market day, which has been ordained,\" explains a skinny, black-clad Jihadi, gesturing at the camera. \n\"With Allah's permission, each will get a share,\" promises another of the fighters.\n\"Where is my Yazidi girl?\" asks the first, a wide grin splitting his straggly-bearded face.\nThe Yazidis are an ancient people, followers of a unique religion that blends elements of Islam, Judaism and Christianity with even more ancient practices, including sun worship.\nThey believe in a single god who created the Earth and left it in the care of a peacock angel, Malak Ta'us. \nBut this belief -- decried as \"devil worship\" by ISIS -- has been used by the Islamic extremists to justify murder, enslavement and rape.\n\"They took our girls, our homes and our families,\" says Yazidi spiritual leader Baba Sheikh. \"They took all of them.

There was a flag of ISIS and a picture of Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi.\"\nAfter abusing her, he passed her on to 11 of his friends, who also raped her.\nYazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS\nIn ISIS territory, Yazidi women can be bought and sold for money, bartered for weapons, even given as a gift; but this is not a simple commercial transaction -- ISIS has made rape and slavery part and parcel of its -- brutal -- theology.\n\"ISIS fighters told us, 'This is the rule of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and we must do it,'\" Noor explains. \"[They said] 'Anyone who doesn't convert to Islam, we will kill the males and marry the girls. They are the spoils of war. '\"\nISIS forced abortions, women say\nIn its online English magazine, Dabiq, ISIS lays out its justification for its brutality against the Yazidis on religious grounds: \n\"Enslaving the families of the kuffar [unbelievers] and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah [Islamic law] that if anyone were to deny or mock, he would be denying or mocking the verses of the Qur'an and the narrations of the Prophet.\"\nBut theologians the world over point out that ISIS's actions have no basis in Islam.\n\"The people of ISIS don't represent Islam at all. In fact, if anything, they are anti-Islam,\" says London-based Imam Ajmal Masroor. \"They have hijacked Islam. They have denigrated Islam. They have desecrated it.\" \n\"In Islam taking anyone as captive, mistreating them using them as sex slaves, torturing them and killing them is totally prohibited.\n\"That's what God says in the Quran: 'Those people who lose their capacity to use their brain, their perceptive capacity to see and hear the truth, they are worse than animals.'\n\"That's exactly what they have demonstrated. There is no room for any discussion on this. It's haram [forbidden], it's anti-Islam and it should be treated as such.\"\nFor Yazidis, the tragedy is so great that their own strict traditions have had to adjust.\n'Hundreds' of Yazidi women killing themselves in ISIS captivity\nBefore ISIS attacked Sinjar, marrying outside the Yazidi faith was strictly condemned. Those accused of adultery -- and even victims of rape -- could be killed for \"dishonoring\" their family.  \nBut that is changing, according to Baba Sheikh, who desperately wants those abducted by ISIS to return.\n\"Anyone who comes back will be warmly welcomed home,\" he insists. \"They should keep their heads up. They have done nothing wrong. And they should not be worried.\"\nHis words are a source of comfort for the tormented; even as ISIS attempts to destroy the Yazidi people in the name of religion, the terror group's victims may still find solace at home.\nHow you can help Yazidis", "Stingy male spiders end up dead": "Scientists have long observed spiders' gift-giving rituals. But the spiders' generosity is not a result of chivalry or making the right moves to woo a mate. \nA study released this week revealed a deeper motive behind some of the male spiders' gift giving: self preservation.\nThe study in the journal Biology Letters singled out \nnursery web spiders Pisaura mirabilis \nas among the species best known\n \nfor giving \"nuptial gifts\" from males to females. \nMale spiders present their female love interests with gifts of insects, mostly flies, wrapped up in intricate webs. \nWhile it may seem like a show of affection, this offering lowers the chances of the male spider ending up as the female's dinner, the study says. \nAnd it can't be just any teeny weeny gift. \nIn some cases, the bigger the gift, the longer the spiders' mating time, the study shows. \nStingy male spiders end up dead\nIn a study of more than 280 spider pairs, researchers discovered that females that ended up with stingy, no-gift males were six times more cannibalistic than females staged with generous, gift-carrying males.\n\"The presence or absence of a gift was the most important factor in determining whether females cannibalized the males,\" the study says.\nFifteen male spiders that tried to court without gifts were eaten even before they could mate, according to the study. \n\"The results showed that pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism was enhanced when males courted without a gift,\" the journal Biology Letters said. \nThe risk of sexual cannibalism for the nursery web spiders that didn't give gifts declined when mating occurred while the female was feeding, according to the study. \nGiving the female food doesn't eliminate all risks of getting eaten. \nIn the study, one male spider that came bearing gifts was eaten after mating.", "A hole punched through history": "During the Great Depression, a federal agency hired famous photographers to document the plight of poor farmers and their lands.

Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged, then spirited across the porous border by boat, motorbike or car. Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China, where the one-child policy and long-standing preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio.  \nTo put it simply, Chinese men are hungry for brides.  \n\"It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman,\" explained Ha Thi Van Khanh, national project coordinator for the U.N.'s anti-trafficking organization in Vietnam. Traditionally, Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding.  \"This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries, including Vietnam.\"   \nDiep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam. She says that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of $3,000 to the end buyer and that they are often considered desirable because of cultural similarities to the Chinese.   \nNguyen was just 16 when a friend's boyfriend drugged her and smuggled her into China. She tried to resist a forced marriage. For three months, she refused, even though her traffickers beat her, withheld food and threatened to kill her, she says. Finally, she relented. She says her husband was kind to her, but she never stopped missing her family in Vietnam.   \n\"My desire to go home was indescribable,\" Nguyen said. \"I agreed to marry the man but I could not stay with a stranger without any feelings for him.\"  \nWhen her mother-in-law realized Lan was never going to warm to the marriage, the family returned her to the traffickers. They got their money back, Nguyen says, after which she was forced into a second marriage.   \nA refuge for escaped women\nThe Pacific Links Foundation runs a shelter for trafficking victims in the city of Lao Cai, northern Vietnam. The young women stay for an average of two to three years. They go to school or get vocational training. They do art therapy. They learn to cook and sew and keep a big garden. Surrounded by other woman with similar experiences, the shelter helps them get back on their feet and then to find jobs to support themselves.  \n\"Once that whole investment process can happen with these young women then it is much easier for them to have their own lives,\" says Diep. \nHer organization also does community outreach to try and stop more girls from falling into the hands of traffickers. About once a month, a group of trafficking victims visits the market at Bac Ha, a regional hub for buying food, fabric and livestock. On this day, on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers, they talk about their experiences, take questions and play games with the crowd. When they ask people to share personal experiences concerning trafficking, more than 20 people come forward.   \n\"I think awareness is the only tool,\" Diep says. \nHa from the U.N. agrees that the top priority is to spread awareness, especially in the poor, rural regions along the border. She also believes reducing poverty will help stop women going to China seeking work, another common way traffickers lure victims.\nSaved at the border\nDuring CNN's trip to the border, the government called and told us the police had just rescued five girls as they were about to cross the border with a trafficker. We met the girls, who are just 14 years old. They said they were promised $600 to go to work in China by a neighbor from the same village. They didn't tell their parents they were going. The neighbor is now under arrest.  \nThe Vietnamese police are sometimes able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China, by enlisting the help of Chinese authorities. Nguyen Tuong Long, the head of the government's social vice prevention department in Lao Cai, says last year they rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims.\n\"Because of cooperation between the Vietnamese and the Chinese police, we have found and caught trafficking rings,\" Nguyen says. \"We've found women far inside China, at brothels where they're forced to become sex workers.\"  \nTrafficked women who aren't rescued in raids have to find ways to get out on their own.  \nSome of them say they were able to contact their families from China, but they couldn't get help from police because they didn't know exactly where they were.  \nLan and Nguyen ended up in the same town in China. After two years, together they managed to slip out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station. The whole time they were afraid their husbands' families would find them. The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam.  \nThe women were free of their forced marriages, but they paid a high price. Both left their babies in China. \nLan says if she saw her daughter again, she would apologize for leaving her behind. \"I hope she'll have a better life there,\" she says.  \nBoth Lan and Nguyen say in school their teachers had talked to them about trafficking. At the time, neither believed it could happen to them.", "The world's first ghetto, 500 years later": "But all he found was an overwhelming silence -- an element that became central to the photographs he made there.   \n\"It was summer in Venice, and the place was fairly deserted and quiet,\" Gafic said. \"You can tell that very few people still live there.\" \nThere is a palpable void in each of Gafic's photos, a recognition of the vast silence of the world when crimes against humanity were committed. A mourning silence for a once-bustling community devastated by centuries of prejudice and finally the Holocaust. The photos are filled with wide spaces, usually featuring a lone character framed by an empty expanse. \n\"I do understand what it is like to be in a lockdown situation, so it was sadly an advantage during that assignment,\" said Gafic, a Bosnian who was 12 years old during the Siege of Sarajevo. \"That (experience) really shaped my vision of the world, which I try to translate into imagery.\"  \nIn the early 13th century, persecuted Jews from Europe and the Levant began settling in Venice. As their population grew, so did their living restrictions, and in 1516 Venetian authorities forced all Jews to live in confinement in the \"geti,\" which is where the modern-day term of \"ghetto\" is derived. In this gated islet, Jews lived in lockdown by night but were allowed to trade by day as long as they wore an insignia. \nThey were merchants and moneylenders, artisans and artists. They injected Venice's economy with much-needed capital and intellect. There were also famous doctors and scholars in the ghetto, which by the 14th century became a melting pot of Jewish ethnicities all crammed into small rooms and apartments of substandard ceiling height.\nIn the 1790s, Napoleon's army destroyed the ghetto's gates, allowing Jews to live freely among Venetians. Many Jews opted for the lavish palazzos across the canals. \nThe Venetian Ghetto has survived a long history of atrocities, from early religious persecutions to the Holocaust. Of the 246 Jews deported from Venice to concentration camps, only eight have survived. \nThere is a seductive, timeless aura to Gafic's photos of the ghetto.\nOne shows a scholar reading in a large empty courtyard where a bronze Holocaust memorial was installed. Above the memorial's ancient walls is some rusting barbed wire. \nThis photograph seems to allude to a wound that only human enlightenment can heal. As a survivor of the Bosnian War, Gafic relived some of the unhealed traumas during his visit.\n\"I have a special empathy for people who have lived under siege,\" Gafic said. \"The siege mentality is very particular, it never leaves you. \n\"It is known that people in Sarajevo always have this sense of confinement and claustrophobia. Anyone who has been through it has a form of post-traumatic syndrome which is passed on to other generations.\"", "Majority of Israel's female politicians 'harassed'": "Thirty-two of them are women -- and almost all say they've been sexually assaulted or harassed.\nA new report from Channel 2, a CNN affiliate in Israel, says that 28 female Knesset members from across the political spectrum have faced sexual harassment -- a year after Israelis elected more women to serve in the Knesset than ever before. \nA handful of male Israeli politicians and high-ranking members of the Israel Defense Forces have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent years.\nSilvan Shalom, the country's interior minister, stepped down late last year after \nharassment accusations surfaced.\nMerav Ben Ari, a member for the centrist Kulani party, recounted a commander making sexual advances toward her during her army service in the 1990s. \nShe told CNN that younger officers often looked up to their commanders as \"adored role models,\" adding \"when he (the commander) asks you to do something for him, you do it -- and you don't think about the situation.\"\n\"My commander asked me to join him in his car for a drive at around 12 o'clock at night,\" 40-year-old Ben Ari said of her experience some two decades earlier. \n\"But when he tried something, I said 'stop it,' and it didn't actually happen.\"\nShe added that the sexual climate in Israel had changed dramatically since then, with many workplaces now employing staff tasked with tackling harassment. \nHowever, Ben Ari would still like to see schools introduce better sexual harassment education to teenage boys.\nStories of groping, pinching\n\"There were periods where I was so sexually harassed ... in the street, I felt sometimes that it was difficult to go out onto the street,\" said Knesset member Ksenia Svetlova of the center-left Zionist Union party. \"They were looking at me, playing with my hair and sometimes coming up with indecent proposals.

The detection of this signal is a first step,\" BEA Director Remy Jouty said in a statement, according to an agency spokesman.\nThe Airbus A320, which had 66 people aboard, crashed in the Mediterranean on May 19 on a flight from Paris to Cairo.\nSince then, authorities have been searching for wreckage and the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders, which could reveal evidence about what caused the crash.\nAuthorities hope to locate the data recorders, so a specialized vessel managed by the Deep Ocean Search company can then retrieve them. That vessel is set to join the search team within a week, the investigative committee said. \nSo far, search teams have found small pieces of debris, victims' remains and personal effects from the plane. They haven't found the aircraft's fuselage.\nAnalyst: Searchers are nearing wreckage\nDetecting the beacon is a sign that searchers are closing in, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said. \n\"That means they're probably within one to three miles (of the black boxes),\" she said. \"That is the distance that these beacons can broadcast, so they are literally almost on top of them.\"\nAnd it's likely, Schiavo said, that the recorders will be with the bulk of the wreckage from the plane.\n\"Hopefully they have finally got the right beacon, the right location, and soon we'll have answers,\" she said.\nConflicting reports over final moments\nThis isn't the first time investigators have said they detected a signal from the plane.\nLast week a lead investigator in the search said \nairplane manufacturer Airbus had detected signals\n from the plane's Emergency Locator Transmitter, a device that can manually or automatically activate at impact and will usually send a distress signal.\nTime critical\nThe signals gave investigators a more specific location to detect pings from the black boxes, state media reported.\nTime is of the essence: The batteries powering the flight recorders' locator beacons are certified to emit high-pitched signals for about 30 days after they get wet.\nFour scenarios on EgyptAir Flight 804\nOnce they're found, the black boxes will be brought to Egypt, a civil aviation ministry official told CNN.

Their findings were published in \nthe latest edition of PNAS. \nThe team found two subterranean pits with beer-making equipment that included funnels, pots and amphorae holding the residue of what probably was 5,000-year-old beer.\n\"The shapes and styles of the vessels show stylistic similarities to the brewing equipment in the historical period and modern ethnographic records,\" said study co-author Jiajing Wang.\nThe archeologists believe the pits would have acted like an ancient cooler, helping in the beer-making process and with storage. \nA pottery stove found in each pit may have been used to keep the ingredients at the optimal temperature for mashing, a technique similar to what you would see in beer-making today. \nTests of the yellow residue show the presence of barley, broomcorn millet, tubers and Job's tears (also known as Chinese pearl barley or coix seed), which were fermented together to make what probably would have been a sweet and sour kind of brew.\n\"This beer recipe indicates a mix of Chinese and Western traditions: barley from the West, millet, Job's tears, tubers from China,\" Wang said.\nThe experts suggest, though, that you shouldn't run right out to try that recipe in your home operation, as the ancients may have included other ingredients in their concoctions that were lost to time.\nBarley was the big surprise, as it has never been detected in archaeological materials from China that were this old. \nThe authors argue that barley was probably introduced into the area for beer making. They don't believe people were using it for food until much later, although more research is needed to prove that theory. \nEarlier research has shown that beer has long been a part of Chinese culture. It gets a mention in the written record in the late Shang dynasty (circa 1250-1046 B.C.). \nA short, intoxicating history of beer\nAncient humans' love of beer has also been known for decades. Some archeologists argue that it was that love, and not an interest in breakfast or bread, that led to the domestication of cereals around 9500-8000 B.C. Up to 40% of the annual cereal crop in Mesopotamia may have gone to the production of beer. \nArcheologists have found evidence of 11,000-year-old brewing troughs at Gobekli Tepe in Turkey. \nBeer was also the national drink in Mesopotamia and Egypt, according to research from \nXavier University theologist Michael Homan\n. You could get paid in beer or pay for your bride with it. It was used as medicine and as a cosmetic. \nThere are ancient gods dedicated to beer, like the Sumerian goddess Ninkasi, who has her own drinking hymn. Temples kept their own brewers on the payroll. \nEven the modern God (i.e. Yahweh), was believed to have a sizable drinking habit. The ancients were encouraged to offer it as a daily libation \nas is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, Numbers 28: 7-10.  \nThe benefits of beer\nBeer in the ancient world was used much like it is now, as a kind of social lubricant. (\"Hey, handsome ancient Sumarian stonecutter, let me buy you a beer. You come here often?\"). Beer has also been found in \npaintings at ancient brothels\n. \nBut it also served in a more important everyday role: Beer was a much safer alternative to drinking water in the pre-Brita-filter era. The alcohol killed many of the microorganisms you'd find in your local watering hole. \nIn this study, the authors suggest that beer drinking, often a habit we associate more with frat parties than with sophisticated f\u00eates, may have actually spawned a social complexity not seen in Chinese culture previously. \nPublic buildings from that time period suggest a kind of hierarchy in the culture. It may have had an elite class that engaged in a kind of competitive feasting and drinking. \nBeer, the researchers argue, \"may have contributed to the emergence of hierarchical societies.\" In other words, it may have been one of the driving forces behind the development of sophisticated cultures in an area known as the cradle of Chinese civilization.\nThe development of beer bellies, however, is probably a more modern phenomenon.

This first Mombasa-Nairobi stretch will be completed by June 2017, consulting firm CPCS told CNN. \nIt is hoped that the track will shorten the journey between the two cities from 12 hours to four hours. Passenger trains will travel at 120km/h, and freight trains will be able to carry 25 million tonnes per year, according to the \nInternational Railway Journal\n. \nEventually, the East Africa Railway Masterplan will link Mombasa with other major east African cities such as Kampala, in Uganda, and Juba, in South Sudan. \nInvestment from China \nThe East Africa Railway Masterplan is being managed by the \nEast Africa Community\n; an intergovernmental organization of six partner states; Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, which aims to create a politically united and secure East Africa. \nManagement \nconsulting firm CPCS\n advised the East Africa Community on the financial, legal and economic \nimpact of the project\n. \nThe railway is being built by the state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), 90% of the ongoing development of the Mombasa-Nairobi section is being financed by The Export-Import Bank of China. \nThe hope is that this new railway will reduce congestion on Kenya's crowded road network, and promote tourism.  \nThis railway is the most expensive of a series of construction projects in Africa. \nAccording to Deloitte\n, more than $131 billion was spent on transportation construction on the continent in 2015; by 2025, $200 billion is expected to be spent on the continent's roads, and another $7 billion dollars on African airports. \nChina has been investing in other projects in Africa, \nincluding a mega port in Lamu\n, Kenya, and a manufacturing zone in Ethiopia. \nWildlife sanctuary controversy\nControversy has not been absent, however, from the new railway: initially, the proposed route would cut into Nairobi's wildlife sanctuary. \nA deal was made between wildlife officials and the Kenyan government, \naccording to the Guardian\n, that the track would be walled off. \nIt remains to be seen if the railway will have as big an economic impact as predicted. \nIn November 2013, Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta laid the foundation stone for the construction, \ntelling local media\n; \"The project will define my legacy as president of Kenya.

Today, despite years of regional instability and daily threats, the population of gorillas in the park has doubled.\nFossey was killed in Rwanda nearly 30 years ago, but the work she started continues through the \nDian Fossey Gorilla Fund International\n, and the nonprofit owes much of its success to its namesake.\n\"At that time, the image of them was 'King Kong' -- ferocious, strong, scary beast,\" said Tara Stoinski, the Fossey Fund's president and CEO. \"She really pioneered the study of gorillas and habituating them, getting them used to human presence, so you and I can sit as far away as that next office and observe the details of their life.\"\nThe gorillas' comeback has not been easy, mostly due to habitat loss. \n\"They are literally stuck on top of these volcanoes surrounded by a sea of people,\" Stoinski said. \" It's one of the highest human population densities in Africa, so there's a lot of pressure on the forest and the area that they live.\"\nAccording to Stoinski, human diseases are a major threat, as is the hunting of other wildlife in the forest. Sometimes snares are set to catch antelopes and other food sources, and gorillas can get caught.\nTo protect the gorillas, the organization uses a holistic approach. The Fossey Fund works with Rwanda's park rangers to provide protection, 365 days a year. The group also continues the research that Fossey started, gathering data every day to better understand the species. And then there are initiatives aimed at the local human population -- providing clean water access and bolstering the scientific capacity of the Rwandan people.\nThe goal is to build a model that can be exported to save other species facing extinction. Right now, the Fossey Fund is taking its model to Congo, where eastern lowland gorillas are being wiped out by hunting and poaching.\nAnd despite the slowly climbing population in Rwanda, the mountain gorillas' future remains in jeopardy. At last count, there were just 880 left on the planet.\n\"I'm cautiously optimistic, but I know that their extinction is something that could happen,\" said Veronica Vecellio, the Fossey Fund's Rwanda-based research manager. \"My optimism is dictated by the success we've had in past decades, but what are decades in the history of the planet?\"\nTo protect the mountain gorillas from extinction, you can make an impact by making a donation to support the \nFossey Fund's conservation programs.", "What Syrian refugees couldn't leave home without": "", "The war heroes hunting child predators": "Each candidate is a veteran of America's recent wars.

On September 9, 2015, the Queen became the longest-reigning monarch in British history.", "Children confined to a voodoo convent": "But what happens inside the hundreds of facilities dotting the country is a mystery to most outsiders. Now advocates are raising the alarm saying the facilities may harm the children they aim to help.  \nDjofin Assou Gilbert is an advocate for children in Benin. He first became concerned about the practices inside the convents in early 2015, when he noticed a group of children standing outside a convent.\n\"It was the middle of the day and the children weren't wearing their school uniform,\" he remembers. \"I wanted to know why they weren't in school. I tried to ask a little girl why she was there, but she couldn't answer.\"\nThe girl, he says, had lost her mother tongue. \n\"I was desperate to find out more. Like many people in Benin I'd heard of these convents, but I didn't know what was happening inside.\"\n\"Those who practice Voodooism believe that illness is caused by evil spirits. If children fall sick, their parents seek treatment through Voodoo gods. The children allegedly possessed by spirits can be sent or even 'sold' to be healed in Voodoo convents,\" notes Hadrien Bonnaud, a communication specialist for \nUNICEF\n based in Benin.\nThe ceremonies that are meant to heal these children are expensive: about $1800 (a princely sum for a population that lives on less than $1 per day). In order to afford treatment, UNICEF says some parents sell their children to work in the convents until the debt is paid off (a practice that can take months or even years).\n\"If they are unable to pay their debts, the children are forcibly taken from them,\" explains Bonnaud.\nUNICEF is one of several NGOs that have become concerned in recent years with the practices carried out inside Benin's traditional Voodoo convents. The exact number of convents in the country is unknown, but as of 2014, UNICEF has identified 432 in five out of Benin's 77 municipalities. \nLife inside the convent\nPlan International\n, a children's rights advocacy group, has also done research on the conditions inside the convents. Operating in the district of Couffo in south Benin, the organization has interviewed dozens of parents, voodoo priests and children about life inside these spaces. \n\"I was given a concoction and every time I took it, I was sick -- that was my treatment until I healed,\" recalls Houndedji, 6, one of the children Plan International interviewed. \nIn some cases a voodoo god will be assigned to a child, and symbolic scars will be carved into the skin. Madeline, 10, another child that Plan International interviewed, recalls the scarification she received as part of her treatment. \n\"It was very painful and there was so much blood... it was everywhere.\" \nAccording to the charity, children as young as two years old can be kept in these convents -- where access to education and healthcare is minimal. These children have to give up their names, learn a new language (that of voodoo) and begin an entirely new life. In some instances, when the initiated are finally released (sometimes up to a decade after they arrived), they no longer have families to return to. \n\"Seven years is far too long to be kept in a convent,\" argues Angela Singh, a global press officer at Plan International. \n\"They come out and many of them have grown up; sometimes their parents have died, they have nowhere to go, no education. It's difficult to integrate back into communities. Their childhood has just passed them by.\"\nFurther complicating matters is the fact that only those initiated into the voodoo religion are allowed entry to the convents, making it hard both to monitor conditions inside and provide those living in the convents with the medical attention they might  need. \n\"Very often convents are places kept in secret and the initiated who attend them have to keep those secrets,\" says Bonnaud. \nAfter Gilbert saw the children in 2015 and grew concerned, he arranged meetings with chief priests and then their president, Mama Hounza Tognon Mahouchi.\n\"We discussed the situation and he agreed with my ideas. However, he put in place a condition that I needed to get indoctrinated into voodooism, to bring about reform.\" Though he can't discuss the rituals he had to undertake, he was subject to scarification on the side of his body. \nOnce initiated, Gilbert had open access to the convents and could speak more candidly with its priests. Gilbert works with \nReSPESD\n, a child advocacy group that partners with Plan international. He notified Plan International Benin of his findings.\n'I was ignorant'\nBoth Plan International and UNICEF have been holding talks with community leaders to limit the confinement period spent inside these convents and provide the children inside with greater access to education. In 2015, both organizations met with voodoo chiefs, local authorities and political figures to raise awareness about child rights within the convents.  \nIn Couffo alone, 310 children (193 girls, 117 boys) left compounds. Some had homes to go to while others fell under the responsibility of Gilbert, who runs an orphanage. Of those released, 280 are now in school and 30 have gone into apprenticeships.\nHoundedji and Madeline both aspire to be a headmistress one day, a future once unimaginable in the convent. Eric, who still doesn't know where his parents are or what happened to them, has loftier ambitions: he wants to become president of Benin.\nSingh is quick to stress that throughout discussions, the finger of blame was not pointed at the priests.\n\"They believe they are doing what's best for the child,\" she says. \"These priests were willing to look at different ways to adapt their practices so children can get an education.\"\n\"I let this go on because I was ignorant,\" chief priest Mahouchi told Plan International. \"I believed it was our laws and regulations, governed by the voodoo and the oracles that determined how long children should spend in the convent.\"", "What a shot! 29 amazing sports photos": "Take a look at 29 amazing sports photos from May 24 through May 30.", "World's longest tunnel opens": "Fittingly for a project billed as Switzerland's \"construction of the century,\" the Gotthard Base Tunnel was inaugurated amid colorful, sometimes surreal scenes, with visiting dignitaries treated to costumed dancers, fireworks and plenty of yodeling and alphorns.\nEuropean leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi joined Swiss President Johann Schneider-Ammann on the first official journey on the line.\nThe 57-kilometer long (35-mile long) tunnel creates a high-speed rail link deep beneath the famous mountain range, connecting northern and southern Europe.\nAnd with characteristic Swiss punctuality, this major engineering feat has been completed on schedule.\nShortcut through the Alps\nReaching a depth of 2,300 meters (7,545 feet, almost 1.5 miles) the tunnel will slice an hour off the travel time between\n \nZurich, Switzerland, and Milan, Italy.\nTrains will travel the tunnel, which runs between the towns of Erstfeld in the north and Bodio in the south, in only 20 minutes, reaching speeds of up to 250 kilometers an hour (155 mph), according to the Swiss Travel System.\nBeyond the anticipated benefits for travel and trade, the project will provide a direct and economic route for freight transport.\nAlpTransit Gotthard, the company behind the construction of the tunnel, says the project will boost the efficiency and reliability of rail freight, making it more competitive.\nGotthard overtakes the 53.9-kilometer Seikan Tunnel in northern Japan as the longest rail tunnel in the world, relegating the 50.5-kilometer Channel Tunnel between Britain and France into third place.\nEnvironmental benefits\nThe line, which will begin full operations in December, will establish a mainline rail corridor through Europe from the Dutch port of Rotterdam in the north to the Italian port of Genoa on the Mediterranean.\nIt is expected to bring significant environmental benefits by diverting freight sent by road on to rail instead.\n\"The main reason for the construction of this tunnel was to get the goods traffic off the motorway and onto the trains,\" Simon Peggs of AlpTransit Gotthard,\n told CNN when the tunnel was completed.\n\"It's just getting more and more (busy) every year and it was estimated that by 2020, the roads will be so blocked that something had to be done.\"\nIt is anticipated the economic benefits of increased trade and travel efficiency will make inroads into the tunnel's $12 billion construction cost.\nAlpine route remains\nThe new tunnel, greenlighted by the Swiss public in a national referendum in 1992, bypasses the scenic original Gotthard line.\nThat line, popular with tourists for its panoramic views as it winds through the mountain range, crossing 205 bridges in the process, will continue to operate, the Swiss Travel System says.\nHow to build the world's longest train tunnel\nSafety pledge\nAbout 2,600 workers have been involved in the construction of the tunnel, with nine losing their lives in the process. About 3,200 kilometers of copper cable was used in the tunnel's construction -- enough to stretch from Madrid to Moscow.\nAlpTransit Gotthard CEO Renzo Simoni said that among the logistical challenges involved in the project was cooling air temperatures within the tunnel.\n\"The deeper you get, the higher temperature of rock is,\" he said, adding that without appropriate ventilation, temperatures in the tunnel could reach 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). \n\"We had to cool down all the air inside down to 28 degrees Celsius,\" he said. \n\"You need a lot of electricity to bring fresh air from outside into the working place.\"\nHe claimed that the tunnel was \"10 times safer than the existing railway network in Switzerland.\n\"If you are doing a journey, for example, from Zurich to Milan, the safest part of your journey would be the passage of the tunnel,\" he said.\nThe \nfinal two meters of rock were drilled through\n amid fanfare six years ago.", "Vietnam: From enemy to partner": "Viewing the dark cells of Hoa Lo Prison -- the \"Hanoi Hilton\" that housed American prisoners of war -- invited memories of a long and bitter war. A statue of McCain that stands beside Truc Bach Lake in central Hanoi marks the spot where his A-4E Skyhawk was shot down in 1967. Visiting Haiphong recalled the intensity of conflict in that once-embattled harbor.\nAmong the population, however, and in the corridors of Vietnamese government, the gaze was toward the future and not the past. Now, as President Barack Obama prepares for the first presidential visit to Vietnam in a decade, he will encounter a country undergoing rapid change and seeking ever-closer ties to the United States. That's an opportunity Washington should not let pass by.\nThe pace of change in Vietnam presents a few historical ironies. One of these emerged a year ago when Nguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of the country's ruling party, \nmade a visit to Washington\n. I attended an address Trong delivered at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce following his meetings at the White House.  It's unlikely that I was the only participant who marveled at the sight of the Communist Party's general secretary -- who once studied in the Soviet Union and edited his country's Communist Review -- calling for free trade at a bastion of market capitalism.\nSuch is the new Vietnam. A member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it boasts an economy growing near 7% annually, with exports growing faster still. It has a large and increasingly connected youth population. And amid its growing regional heft, Vietnam has a leadership that, like the United States, watches China's assertiveness with growing concern.\nThat's why Obama's visit makes so much sense, and represents another step on the path from war, through normalization, and to partnership. But what happens after the president departs Vietnam will be more important still.\nThe administration is expected to announce a repeal of the ban on lethal arms sales to Vietnam, a welcome step that would build upon the\n 2014 decision to lift restrictions on sales of weapons related to maritime security.\n \nGiven Vietnam's legacy Russian systems and limited defense budget, Washington should help bolster its defense capabilities by ensuring that Vietnam receives assistance under the new, \n$425 million Maritime Security Initiative\n as well as other financing programs. Hanoi's acquisition of radars, surveillance drones, reconnaissance aircraft and other systems would enhance its maritime domain awareness and its ability to secure its littoral areas.\nThe events of 2014, during which a Chinese offshore oil drilling rig sailed well inside Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, demonstrated the need for maritime-related assistance to Vietnam. \nBefore the rig withdrew, Chinese vessels \nrepelled Vietnamese efforts\n to interdict its operations, rammed Vietnamese boats and succeeded in sinking one. Given China's threats to freedom of navigation and efforts to claim much of the South China Sea as its own, the United States has an interest in helping partners like Vietnam deter new provocations.\nThe ability of the U.S. Navy to access ports in Vietnam will likely be under discussion during the President's visit, and in its aftermath Washington should encourage the opening of those ports not only to American vessels, but also to those of other friendly militaries.  Vietnam has established an international facility at Cam Ranh Bay, one of Southeast Asia's finest deep-water ports and a major U.S. military hub during the war.  Washington should seek the ability to operate out of Cam Ranh and encourage its further development as a regional locus for naval operations. The \nvisit earlier this year of two Japanese destroyers\n is but one example of what is possible.\nVietnam has a broader role to play in the Pentagon's recent embrace of networked security in Asia, a vision that supplements America's four bilateral alliances with a web of connections among partners and allies. Over the past year alone, Hanoi has beefed up defense ties with Japan, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines. These developments have a stabilizing effect on a region in which China is throwing around its ample weight.\nIn addition to deepening security ties, there are other items that should fill the bilateral agenda after Obama departs Vietnam. The U.S. Congress must either approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement or suffer a major setback to America's strategic position in Asia. Washington should be vocal both publicly and privately about human rights abuses in Vietnam, and push for greater religious freedom, basic liberties, and the release of political prisoners. \nVietnamese leaders should know that their brand of autocracy will place an inevitable constraint on closer ties with the United States. And the United States should demonstrate, in word and deed, that its presence and commitment to Asia is enduring.\nHere the increasing warmth between the United States and Vietnam can prove particularly effective.  At a moment of constrained defense budgets, rising Chinese assertiveness, and questions about the future trajectory of U.S. foreign policy, locking in the transformation of Vietnam from enemy to partner would say a great deal about American priorities. President Obama's visit represents the chance to begin writing that new chapter.\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.", "Rare blue diamond sells for record price": "The sparkling gem sold to a private collector, whose identity Christie's has not yet revealed. \nMounted on a platinum ring and flanked on either side by a trapeze-shaped diamond, the 14.62 carat Fancy Vivid stone is the largest and best quality blue diamond ever to appear at auction.\nIn blue diamonds, Fancy Vivid describes stones that are medium to dark in tone and strong to very strong in color saturation.\nRead: These watches are worth millions\nIt was named after its former owner, the late Sir Philip Oppenheimer, a diamond dealer whose family owns the influential diamond company De Beers. \nThe Oppenheimer steals the title of world's most expensive diamond from the 12.03 carat \"Blue Moon of Josephine,\" which held the previous record at $48.4 million. \nThat rock was bought by Chinese property billionaire Mr Joseph Lau in November, for his 7-year-old daughter Josephine. \nRead: Billionaire buys world's most-expensive diamond for his 7-year-old\nBlue diamonds are exceptionally rare, comprising only around 0.0001% of the world's diamonds, according to Christie's.

Some from her native Assam state; others from this working class neighborhood in West Delhi.\nA few steps behind her are a handful of social workers and coordinators from Bachpan Bachao Andolan, a local charity that has rescued thousands of children from human trafficking.\nBut Gaur -- a victim of trafficking herself -- is here on a much more personal mission: Finding her little sister.\nGaur was born in a rural village in Assam. Her parents worked on a tea plantation, one of hundreds scattered throughout the northern state, which produces more black tea than anywhere in the world. \nOfficially, tea workers in her village are supposed to earn around $2 U.S. a day, plus the equivalent of around $2 U.S more as in-kind services provided by their employer, like free housing, medical care, and primary education.  With no advanced education and no hope of a better life, Gaur desperately wanted a way to help her parents make ends meet.\n Read the Tea Industry's full response to CNN's questions\nShe still remembers the day the agent came knocking on her door.  She was just 14.\n\"One morning, he came to our house and said that he would put us to good work,\" she says.  \nThe agent said he could arrange for Gaur to work for wealthy homeowners in Delhi where domestic servants are often employed to do everything from cooking to cleaning to looking after young children.\nGaur says the agent lived in her own village and was well-known.  She thought she could trust him.  \n\"I was easily convinced\" she says. \"We're poor and live in a broken house without a rooftop. I thought I could earn and help my parents, and my sisters, so that we could study.\"\nShe was wrong.\nIn Delhi, she was kept in a house with other girls from Assam -- just like her -- all waiting to be sold as domestic labor. That's when she says the violence started. \n\"If the girls didn't listen,\" she explains, \"they often hit them.\"\nIn one case, Gaur says the man who appeared to be the ringleader gave one of the girls a drink that rendered her nearly unconscious, and then took her to an empty room upstairs.  \n\"She said that they got her too drunk and she couldn't do anything to stop him. I saw with my own eyes the number of girls they abused,\" Gaur says.\nThroughout the ordeal, Gaur says she was too afraid to report anything to authorities.  For one, she was new to the city and didn't know anybody.  And more importantly, she didn't have anywhere else she could go.  \nPolice in Assam say young girls from tea plantations are easy targets. They live in poverty, have very little education, and their parents are often saddled with debt.\nMost are descendants of the original bonded laborers brought in from other parts of the country by British colonial rulers. They live in the same circumstances as they did more than a century ago, with the same impoverished lifestyles.\nPolice say young girls see placement agencies as a way to escape the cycle, lured by promises of good jobs and a steady income. Instead, they often find themselves sold as domestic labor or forced to work in the sex industry.  Police say hundreds of girls in tea districts fall victim to traffickers every year.  In the worst cases, fathers sell their own daughters as a way to escape poverty.\nAfter she realized what was happening, Gaur says she pleaded with the men.\n\"I tried telling them that I wanted to go home,\" she says. \"But [the agent] said that they had already spent a lot of money on me, and that my family had to repay all of it before they could let me go.  And so, I had to stay.\"\nShe wound up being sent to a middle-class home, working as a domestic servant. There was no abuse, she says, but there was also no money. Her employers told her they sent her monthly salary directly to the placement agency. She never saw a single rupee. She says she worked around the clock, but never entertained the thought of leaving.\n\"I was new there and didn't know anyone,\" she says. \"Who could I have possibly escaped with?\"\nAfter a year, Gaur says she mustered up the courage to explain her situation to a friendly neighbor, who gave her enough money for a train ticket back home. She didn't tell the homeowners she was going.  She just took her things and left.\nGaur says life in her village in Assam is still better than working for the trafficker, but now she has another problem. Her sister, Aarti, has been lured away by traffickers. The last time Gaur spoke with her on the phone, she was in tears.\nFor help, Manju Gaur has turned to Bachao Bachpan Andolan, or the BBA. Its founder, Kailash Satyarthi, is a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his work in combating child labor and trafficking.\nThe BBA has arranged to bring Gaur to Delhi, where they've traced the trafficker's location to a non-descript apartment complex.\nAs police barge through the doors, calling out the trafficker by name, they have no idea what they'll find.  \nGaur is led by police, room by room, asking if she recognizes anyone. She doesn't, and when they turn the corner to the next room, they find something that unfortunately is commonplace in raids like this.\nThree young girls, all huddled in a corner. They look frightened and shell-shocked. They tell police they're all from Assam, and that they were lured to Delhi by a man who said he worked for a placement agency. They say they were told he received 15,000 rupees -- just over $200 -- for each girl he brought in.  But they haven't seen any money.\n\"He told us he gave my mummy the money,\" the youngest girl says.\nUpstairs, police finally nab the trafficker, a man with a slight pot belly. When they bring him down, he appears unremorseful, insisting the girls came to Delhi of their own free will\nOutside the police station, CNN Freedom Project confronts the trafficker with accusations that he was exploiting the girls\n\"They were not bought\" he says. \"We take a 35,000 (rupees) service charge for an 11-month agreement.  Those who bring them from the village get 25,000 for an 11-month base.  \n\"Some girls' husbands bring them.  Some (girls') fathers bring them.  They also get a commission.\nLater, inside the police station, they prepare the formal charges, including bonded labor and cruelty to a child.  While the suspect awaits, he cuts a deal with the police.  He agrees to tell them where Manju's sister, Aarti, is working.\nTwo hours later, a smiling Aarti appears, accompanied by police. Gaur runs into her arms, with the kind of hug that only a loving sister can give.\nShe knows there's a long road ahead.  Aarti will be questioned by police and social workers, sent off to a nearby clinic for a mandatory health inspection, then spend weeks rehabilitating at one of the BBA's shelters for rescued children.\nBut still, for Manju, it's still a victory. Aarti is free. They're together again. For now, that's all that matters.", "Alberta wildfire: 'Welcome home Fort McMurray'": "The air conditioning was on. A single light illuminated his apartment.

And while the images are inherently similar in subject matter, they are just as rich in diversity.\nIn his photo book, the photographer discusses how he was not only struck by the coffee farmers' lives, but by how important the environment is to them. \n\"I can imagine a coffee farmer from the Lujiang Valley in Yunnan Province, China, adjusting quite easily to working the Todos Los Reyes Valley in Costa Rica,\" Salgado wrote. \"For coffee farmers, both rich and poor, their trees represent their capital, even their survival.\"\nEthiopia: A land where coffee meets tradition\nSalgado notes the tough working conditions many coffee farmers face in the fields, writing that their daily wages are often based on the weight of the coffee cherries they collect, for example. \nHe also describes how in the final stage of processing, before coffee's eventual export, flawed or discolored beans must be removed by hand.\n\"On small farms, as in the Lake Nyasa region of Tanzania or the Yirgacheffe region of Ethiopia, this is often the task of women,\" Salgado wrote. \"But with larger companies, such as the Allana Coffee Curing Works in Karnataka State, India, hundreds of men and women are employed to sort through and grade the tiny coffee beans.\"\nFrom the age of 7 to 14, Salgado accompanied his father to collect coffee beans and help him at a mill in Brazil. This was his earliest exposure to the world of coffee, an exposure that led him to pursue a Ph.D. in economics. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the worldwide supply and demand for coffee. \n\"It is perhaps an odd thing for a Brazilian to admit, but I never drink coffee. And yet it runs through my veins,\" Salgado wrote. \"Indeed, at several key moments in my life, coffee has played a central role ... Now it is my hope that the images in these pages convey my pleasure in returning to this world.\"\nBeginning in Brazil in 2002 and concluding in Costa Rica in 2014, Salgado's photos span 10 countries within Latin America, Africa and Asia. The photos serve as an important reminder that with every sip of coffee, we are tasting the time, effort, sacrifice and perseverance of the men, women and children whose hands have cared for our coffee since the very start of its journey.\n\"The grains in every cup of coffee were once touched by human hands,\" Salgado wrote. \"To those hands, I dedicate this book.\"\nWhy is George Clooney betting on South Sudan for his coffee?", "The first American in space": "On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to travel into space."}, "cnn_travel": {"Lush Greek island delivers the good life": "The Greek island of Naxos delivers.\nThe largest and lushest of the otherwise rocky Cyclades, Naxos is sometimes referred to as the \"green leaf\" of the Aegean Sea.\nIts diverse natural setting satisfies the active traveler's appetite for outdoor adventure, and the fertile land feeds those who seek homegrown culinary experiences.\nThere's rich mythology and medieval architecture.

The islet hosted the first ancient Dionysian festivities.\nThe Portara is an arresting sight, especially at sunset and easily accessible via a stone promenade.\nEvidence of the Venetians:\n Further in Naxos Town, also known as Chora, the Venetians left their architectural influence when they established Naxos as the Duchy of the Aegean, the headquarters for a long line of dukes following Marco Sanudo's rule of the region in 1207.  \nToday, Naxos' well-maintained medieval castle, which once protected Naxians from pirate invasions, stands in the historic Kastro (castle) district.\nOne well-preserved tower belonging to Nikos Karavias' family is now a museum and the atmospheric venue for the Domus Festival, a cultural event Karavias organizes every summer.\nTaste of the land: \nAccording to Greek mythology, god of wine Dionysus found his wife Ariadne on Naxos.

", "Relics of Rangoon: Myanmar's disappearing heritage buildings": "\"Visit Yangon now before it changes forever.\" \nIt's a valid concern, given the\n rush of international tourists\n heading for the former Myanmar capital once known as Rangoon isn't slowing. \nIncreased flights, investments in infrastructure and a hotel boom have all coincided with the \npolitical changes of recent years\n.  \nBut while this international attention is certainly playing a role in changing the face of Yangon's streets -- \nKFC, anyone?\n -- an even greater threat looms over the city's biggest tourist attraction -- its stunning heritage buildings.  \nAccording to a new book by international journalist Philip Heijmans, a lack of documentation and political will is seeing these gorgeous landmarks disappear.\nHeijmans' \"\nRelics of Rangoon\n,\" which profiles more than 200 of the city's architectural wonders, is the culmination of over two years of work with a team of more than eight researchers and hundreds of hours of interviews.\nWe caught up with Heijmans, who is currently living and working in Myanmar, to find out more about the city's heritage buildings and their odds of survival. \nCNN: What inspired you to create this book? \nHeijmans: \nWhen I had first taken up an editorship of a local newspaper in Yangon in 2013, my reporters would every now and then bring me a story about one of the city's many colonial-era buildings, and they were always fascinating. \nIt became quickly apparent that the rich built heritage of this storied city was going to be its defining aspect -- something that could make or break its romantic and iconic status in the region. \nI had sought out materials to learn more about Yangon's colonial past and about the buildings themselves, but there was very little available and so I thought it would be cool to do a book that covered the topic comprehensively, featuring pictures of both the interior and facades of the buildings.\nBut months later, I realized that the project made no sense without the accompaniment of historical research for each of the buildings -- some way to truly tell the buildings' stories and historical impact, and so I kind of had to start basically from scratch with my researchers. \nWhich buildings should first-time Yangon visitors check out? \nThe majority of Yangon's most iconic structures are located in the Central Business District at the heart of downtown, the most well-known of which being the Secretariat, or former Ministers' Office, where the father of modern Myanmar, General Aung San, was assassinated in 1947. \nIt was also the seat of parliament after the country took independence from the British in 1948. \nBut aside from its historical significance, the massive red-brick Victorian structure is unmatched in size and grandeur by any other structure in the city.\nSome other obvious choices would have to be the nearby High Court building, opened in 1911, and which today still serves as a courthouse even though the Supreme Court moved to the new capital of Naypyitaw some years ago. \nThe backside of the building, meanwhile, is Pansodan Road -- one of the more famous roads in Yangon with a number of colonial-era banks, administrative buildings and private offices that conclude at Strand Road running parallel to the Yangon River to the south. \nThere you will find the beautiful Myanmar Port Authority Building and across the street from that the Yangon Divisional Court, a portion of which was destroyed in World War II and never repaired.\nWhy are these buildings under threat? \nSince 1990, some 1,500 buildings in downtown Yangon have been torn down and, although the pace of that has slowed dramatically, it has by no means halted. \nTake the Kyaikkasan Race Track, or Gandhi Hall, two places with a wealth of history that helped define this city's past. \nGandhi Hall, named after its most famous visitor, was also the site where the NLD (National League for Democracy) met to discuss how to move forward with the transfer of power after winning the 1990 elections (before the government discounted it), and in both cases there has been one proposal after another to tear them down. \nIt's disgusting.\nBut perhaps the bigger issue lies in Myanmar's stubborn need to tie everything in red tape, while simultaneously confusing basic jurisdictional issues. \nLand and property rights are a mess and unclear in many cases, making it impossible to determine who has the right to sell or the responsibility to renovate. \nIn cases where it is clear, the cost of a responsible renovation is too much for owners to take on, and so they make it their mission put their property in such a state of disrepair that the municipality has no choice but to allow them to tear it down. \nThis often means that the tenants living inside are actually barred by the owner from making fixes themselves -- forcing them to live in squalor.\nIs the government starting to recognize the value in saving these historic buildings? \nThere are good people in the municipal government as well as in the private sector that we worked with for \"Relics of Rangoon\" and the results are starting to show. \nSeveral international bodies have come in and are taking it upon themselves to show the city that perking up some of these historical buildings can have a huge upside. \nThat being said, Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy have only recently begun governing on the regional and national levels and it is just too early to tell how much of a priority this particular issue will be to them.\nInterview edited for length and clarity.", "Daiquiris and Ernest Hemingway in Havana": "", "Travelers' Choice: World's best beaches": "Grace Bay in Turks and Caicos is the world's new No. 1 beach, according to TripAdvisor's Travelers' Choice awards. \nAfter two years at the top of TripAdvisor's rankings of the world's best beaches, Baia do Sancho in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, has been edged out by a sweeping crescent of sand on the north shore of the island of Providenciales in Turks and Caicos.\nThe travel planning and booking site announced winners of its awards for best beaches Wednesday. \nWinning beaches were selected based on the quality and quantity of user reviews and ratings of beaches over a year-long period.\nIn addition to its global list of top beaches, TripAdvisor also ranked award-winning beaches for the United States, the United Kingdom, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, the South Pacific and Europe.\nWith two and a half miles of white sand, Florida's Clearwater Beach topped the U.S. rankings. \nIn Europe, Playa de Ses Illetes in Formentera, Spain, was the top-ranked beach\nAsia's No. 1 beach, according to TripAdvisor reviews, is Ngapali Beach in Myanmar.\nThe top 10 beaches on the global list:\n1.

Nearly 700 were sold \nbefore Boeing stopped making the passenger version in 2005\n. \nThey kept making the cargo version until 2009. Boeing estimates that all the 747s in the 400 series flew a total of more than 5 million flights and more than 17 billion miles.\nDelta dubbed this 747-400 Ship 6301. \nAfter 27 years of service \u2014 first with Northwest Airlines \u2014 then with Delta after the two airlines merged in 2008, it was time to retire Ship 6301 last year. \nDelta, along with other passenger airlines, are phasing out their 747s and replacing them with more fuel efficient, twin-engine jets with fewer seats and about the same range.\nThe Big Move\nSo, how do you move one of the world's biggest airliners to its final resting place? \nFirst, you need a powerful towing vehicle. Inside that short and squat little truck, sits the 747's nose landing gear -- which allows the truck to tow the plane. \nA team of dozens of Delta workers would walk along side the plane as it slowly rolls across the tarmac and onto Atlanta's Toffie Terrace toward the museum. \nSecond you need local police to help you block local traffic.\nYou need a small army of tractor equipment operators to lift and place dozens of steel plates on the curbs to protect against damage as the jumbo jet's main landing gear \u2014 each weighing more than 6,000 pounds \u2014 rolls over the street. \nLight posts had to be temporarily removed to accommodate the plane's gargantuan 211-foot wide wingspan. \nThere was a real sense among everyone that history was being made. \nWorkers stopped to take selfies. \nEven way up high in the plane's cockpit window, you could see someone taking photos of the activity down below as it crossed the intersection of Toffie Terrace and Woolman Place.\nParking a giant airplane\nWhen Ship 6301 made the crucial turn into the museum parking lot, the crowd broke out in cheers. \nThey knew the remaining approximately 700 feet would be relatively easy for the tow vehicle to pull the plane across the smooth flat parking lot to its designated spot near the museum entrance. \nThen it kind of turned into a parade. \nDelta employees and others -- many with huge grins on their faces -- escorted the jet into the parking lot. They walked along side each of its wings --  hooting and hollering with every second of realization they were experiencing rare, up-close access to a moving 747. \nThe final 30 minutes was like the world's most complicated parallel parking test as the plane and the tow vehicle backed up and moved forward again and again. \nFinally the crew seemed satisfied with the plane's position. \nHigh fives were exchanged and it was mission accomplished: a very complicated street crossing for one historic passenger airliner. \nCNN's Thom Patterson writes about aviation.

Hyatt Sha Tin\nThe \nHyatt Regency in Sha Tin\n is the first globally branded hotel in Hong Kong's New Territories.\nSitting next to The Chinese University of Hong Kong means there are lots of students and families, but it's the view of Tolo Harbor, the Kau To Shan mountains and Sha Tin Racecourse that really catch the eye.\n4.

After some criticism of police for their handling of the attacks, it looks like the city has addressed the issue. \nSo here are 9 reasons why Cologne is even better than the German capital. \n1. Location, location, location\nOK, so Berlin is surrounded by wonderful lakes and after four or five hours on the train, travelers can make it to Prague or Warsaw.\nOtherwise, it's pretty isolated. \nCologne not so much: There are four major cities in four other countries not far from its doorstep. \nBrussels, Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Paris are all four hours away by train or car.\nWant a shopping trip to three EU countries in one day? Only 90 minutes from Cologne is Dreil\u00e4ndereck, the corner where the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium meet.\nLet's gloss over Berlin's airport for now (more about this later). At least Cologne has one that works properly.\n 2. The Beer\nYes, yes, Berlin may have a ton of new craft breweries, with new pale ale creations filtered through the socks of brew masters invented on a daily basis. \nBut the quality and heritage of traditional Berlin beer brands is debatable.\nThe local beer in Cologne, the lager-style K\u00f6lsch, enjoys such a pedigree that it's guarded by law.\nServed since World War II, K\u00f6lsch was given \"protected geographical indication\" status in 1997, meaning it can only be produced in Cologne. \nTo underscore its heritage, K\u00f6lsch comes complete with its own serving traditions. \nIt must always be served in small, 0.2 liter glasses. When drinkers have had their fill, they must put a coaster on top of the empty glass, otherwise waiters will keep the beer flowing without asking. \nThat's something the average Berlin hipster waiter won't do.\n3. Carnival\nAs we've \npointed out before\n, the best carnival is in Germany. \nCologne's annual Rose Monday Parade sees more than a million costumed inhabitants and visitors partying like there's no tomorrow.\nTo make this a proper heathen affair, Cologne's pub owners install straw effigies called Nubbel above their doors to bear the guilt of any sins committed during the festivities.\nOn Ash Wednesday, when celebrations end, the Nubbels are burned or thrown in the Rhine River, taking the sins with them. \nIn Berlin, the celebrations end when the nightclub bouncer decides they do. And your sins come home with you to take up space in your overpriced apartment. \nBerliners would beg to differ about Cologne's superiority -- celebratory and otherwise. \n\"Well, I think it is quite provincial,\" born Berliner Andreas Koetter said of Cologne.\n\"Just look at their carnival. It's like they are only allowed to have fun during that time -- whereas in Berlin you can go out every night of the week, and everyone is allowed to celebrate their personal carnival any time they want.\"\n4. The Romans liked it early\nCologne already was a powerful city when the medieval Prussian tribes were paddling their barges along the empty shoreline of Berlin's Spree River.\nAfter all, it was founded in 50 B.C. by the Romans, and it's one of the oldest cities in Germany. \nThat fact is even reflected in the name. Cologne is abbreviated from Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium.\nThere still are Roman leftovers strewn around the city, like the excellently preserved Praetorium and parts of the Roman city wall. \nFind something in Berlin that is older than 1,200 years, and we'll buy you a K\u00f6lsch. \n5. Green demilitarized zones\nOK, we admit it, Berlin is pretty green. \nHowever, this is mostly due to the Cold War division of the city and the post-Berlin Wall transformation of barren strips into common land like the Mauerpark. \nIn Cologne, they made former military grounds available to citizens way before. \nThe old Prussian fortresses that surrounded Cologne were all turned into what is known today as Green Belt, or Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel, by 1925. \nToday, the citizens of Cologne enjoy almost 1,000 hectares of parkland that was formerly verboten military territory.\n 6. Artistic superiority\nBerlin is all about creativity and art, but what's the use if it doesn't have the buyers and collectors?\nCologne has both. \nNot only has the city always played a leading role in the German contemporary and visual arts scene; it also boasts a thriving landscape of galleries.\nIt has one of Germany's best contemporary art museum (the Museum Ludwig) plus the world's oldest art fair, Art Cologne, and its own biennale.\n\"Cologne is excellent for the arts.\" says Jochen Heufelder, director of the Cologne arts biennale New Talents. \"Not only do we have an established network of artists, collectors and arts academies, there also is a long history of creativity in the city.\" \nBy all means go to Berlin to dream about becoming a painter. \nOr come to Cologne and do it for real. \n 7. The Cathedral\nBerlin has the unfinished saga of its new airport -- one that's been under construction since 2006, was supposed to open in 2010 and will now take a least another three years to complete. \nBut dear Berlin, to Cologne this unfinished business is just child's play. \nWhen it comes to monumental celebrations of laissez-faire and failed planning, little beats Cologne Cathedral, among Germany's most-visited landmarks.  \nConstruction began in 1248, was paused in 1473, and was finally completed in 1880. \nOne wooden crane involved in building its south tower sat there from 1450 to 1868 -- more than 400 years.\nThe machines constructing the new Berlin airport won't make it that long.  \nAnd the building called Berlin Cathedral? That's from 1905. Come on.\n 8. The Rhine\nBerlin might have the Spree, a few canals and more bridges than Venice, but Cologne is built on the banks of the second longest European river.\nThe Rhine is a proper river, not a teeny rivulet for pleasure boats like the Spree.\nIts narrowest section in the city is still a whopping 300 meters wide. \nCologne also has Germany's second biggest inland harbor and is a favorite stop for river cruises. \nIt's impossible to imagine the famous Cologne city panorama with cathedral and Hohenzollern train bridge without the impressive band of river beneath?\n9. It's Italy's northernmost city\nAh, winter in Berlin, when it's -20 degrees Celsius for weeks on end, the streets are covered in layers of dirty ice and everyone's hugging their old ovens or hiding in dimly-lit cafes. \nNot so in Cologne.\nThanks to its position on the Rhine, it actually has one of the mildest city climates in Germany. \nSummers here are long, and in winter it hardly ever gets below zero. \nGoing hand-in-hand with that is a distinct al fresco dining and drinking culture, and the city even has a population of wild parrots that thrive in the mild climate.  \nNo wonder the Romans ended up in Cologne first.", "Bourdain on Buenos Aires: Meat, meat and more meat": "", "Hong Kong skyscraper's hidden message": "Appearing on the 118-story facade just after 9:30 p.m. is a seemingly harmless nine-digit number. \nA curious Hong Konger or tourist might wonder what the number signifies. \nThe more politically minded will already know -- the digits represent a clock counting down by the second to July 1, 2047.\nThat's when Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems\" arrangement with Beijing -- which gives the semi-autonomous city freedoms unseen on the mainland -- is set to expire.\nPolitical expression\nAnd how exactly has the clock managed to sneak its way onto the city's most prominent public screen, erected by real estate giant Sun Hung Kai Properties?\nIt was cloaked in a larger artwork as part of a \"large-scale public media art exhibition\" called \"Human Vibrations,\" commissioned by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, a government organization.\n\"Hong Kong is having anxiety -- and a political discussion -- about its fate after 2047,\" Sampson Wong told CNN. \nAlong with Jason Lam, Wong is a co-creator of the animated installation. \"If the Umbrella Movement in 2014 failed to bring democracy, what's going to happen after 2047?\n\"Our work explores this question of self-determination.\"\nThe Hong Kong Arts Development Council said the views and opinions expressed by the artists didn't represent the organization's stance. \n\"If there is any hidden message behind, it is solely the personal idea of the creators,\" the Hong Kong Arts Development Council said in an email.\n\"ICC was not involved in the process of selection or curation of the artworks, which was done by HKADC,\" a representative of Sun Hung Kai Properties said.\nThe blinking digits are embedded in a series of looping phrases and appear for a few moments at the end of a nine-minute exhibit called \"Our 60-second friendship begins now.\"\nThe phrases preceding the countdown are taken from dialogue in the classic 1990 Hong Kong film, \"Days of Being Wild.\"\nThe film's protagonists -- played by Maggie Cheung and the late Leslie Cheung -- share a moment while quietly looking at a watch together.\nSampson Wong told CNN the movie is simply an innocent way for carrying a message, but the themes related to time -- and running out of time -- often found in director Wong Kar-wai's movies also hold relevance.\nDebuting on Tuesday, the animated installation and its subliminal message is scheduled to run every night until June 22.\nWhile the clock displayed on the skyscraper will stay the same throughout the exhibition, a real-time countdown can be found on the installation's \nwebsite\n.\nTiming just a coincidence, say creators\nThe show coincides -- though Wong said not deliberately -- \nwith the three-day visit of Zhang Dejiang\n, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, whose arrival to Hong Kong on Tuesday was met with protests.\nZhang is in Hong Kong to discuss China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative that aims to improve economic ties with central Asia.\nThe countdown would likely have been in the full view of the high-ranking Communist Party official, who was staying in the Grand Hyatt hotel in the neighborhood of Wan Chai.\nOverlooking Victoria Harbor, the International Commerce Center is a frequent host of installations including New Year's Eve countdowns on its facade -- effectively a vertical strip of LED displays.\n\"The ICC made it clear that it wouldn't tolerate political elements\" in its light shows, Wong told CNN. \nWhile authorities from both the Hong Kong Arts Development Council and the ICC had inquired about the number, they didn't ask further after the artists said the digits were \"random,\" Wong said.\nThis isn't the first time the artists have adorned Hong Kong's harbor-facing buildings with messages.\nThey projected motivational messages from around the world onto the government headquarters' facade during pro-democracy protests in 2014, including one from Russian activist band Pussy Riot.\nTo make sure the installation doesn't immediately get axed, the artists placed a media embargo until Wednesday night so that the clock would get to tick for at least two nights.\nThe HKADC said the light show was shown Thursday night without modification and would be shown again at 9:30 p.m. local time Friday.\u200b", "Georgia's 'hangover soup'": "", "Can Cuba's tobacco industry keep up with U.S. tourism?":

a traveler to do with generic governmental guidance for travel to mostly peaceful countries?\nAfter Tuesday's attacks on Brussels Airport and the Maelbeek metro station, \nthe U.S. State Department issued a travel alert \nwarning U.S. citizens traveling in Europe to \"exercise vigilance\" in public places and on mass transit. \n\"Be aware of immediate surroundings and avoid crowded places. Exercise particular caution during religious holidays and at large festivals or events,\" the alert says.\nThe British government \nalso warned its citizens to be vigilant when visiting Belgium.\nSo how does \"vigilance\" translate for the traveler? \nBefore you go\nPick flights at times when the airport isn't busy, says Edward Clark, senior security consultant at  iJET International, a travel-risk-management firm that offers travel security training. \"It may not be convenient, but it is just as undesirable for the threat.\"\nUpon arrival at the airport, get into a secure area as soon as you can, says terrorism expert Richard Bloom. \nAnd when you land, get out of the airport as soon as possible. \nIt helps to know where your embassies and consulates are in the countries you're visiting, since many embassies will help their citizens when there's unrest, says Bloom, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's chief academic officer and director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies.\nBloom advises American citizens to register with the \nU.S. State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program\n, so the government knows where they are in case of trouble.\nAnd family and friends back home should have copies of your itinerary.\nOnce you're there\n\"Don't be head-down in your cell phone, and try not to look like the confused tourist,\" says security consultant Jeff Price of Leading Edge Strategies.\n\"In a foreign environment, know where you're going before you leave your hotel, don't dress like a tourist, with your passport and camera hanging around your neck, and when in a crowded area, be aware of who is around you.\"\nCrowds are admittedly hard to avoid, especially in popular destinations, so heightened awareness is key.\n\"Learn where to stand in the crowd and how to position yourself to limit your vulnerabilities,\" Clark says. \nAnd if you don't like who you're around, pay attention to your intuition and move.\nYou can set up an app or use social media to communicate, share information and track other members of your party, Clark says, and carry a hard copy of a local map. (It will never lose a charge.)\nIn the worst-case scenario, Clark recommends that you \"always be ready to leave on the next available means of transportation.\n\"This means having the money or credit cards, travel documents, passports, etc. with you at all times and a plan to link up with the rest of your party.\"\nThe skeptic's view\nExtreme traveler, author and journalist Robert Young Pelton is skeptical of the government advisories.\n\"The warning means nothing, and there is little a traveler could do to point out or identify a threat even if they did follow this advice,\" says Pelton, who wrote \"The World's Most Dangerous Places.\"\nIn fact, it may be safer than ever to travel, Pelton says. \n\"Take advantage of the increased security and relax,\" he says.\nStill apprehensive?\n\"If you're nervous, stay away from large foreign hotels (U.S. brands) or popular advertised gatherings. \n\"Pick smaller, off-the-beaten-path places to visit. \n\"Terrorists typically choose well-known or crowded venues for deadly work,\" he says.\nInstead of visiting obvious tourist spots, go local and see where people actually live and work. \nLocals, Pelton says, \"know who is who and if things appear odd. And you might even have a better holiday.\"\nBut don't tune out. \nBe aware of the news and keep your wits about you, recommends Lonely Planet editorial director Tom Hall, who is based on London. \nThe advisory is \"a way of advising travelers that it's not completely business as usual.\"\n'I don't want the terrorists to win'\nBeyond doing \"the obvious things\" --  keeping family and friends aware of where she's going, being aware of her surroundings, not taking packages from strangers and reporting suspicious bags -- About.com air travel expert Benet Wilson doesn't plan to change her behavior. \n\"Since 9/11, we live in a different world, where bad actors want to cause death and destruction in the name of their causes,\" Wilson says. \"They want people to be scared to travel.\"\nThat's something Wilson refuses to be. \nThe Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris occurred a week after her family left the city. \n\"People ask if I'll take them back to Paris, and I say 'yes' without hesitation,\" she says. \n\"I don't want the terrorists to win by making me afraid to travel.\"", "Nomadic artist Not Vital's treehouse giants take root": "Born in Switzerland in 1948, Vital has consistently redefined himself, with work that includes tongues sculpted in bronze, portraits of Mao Zedong in panel-beaten silver boxes, camel heads and cow dung cast in aluminum and silver. \nHis architectural projects reflect his nomadic lifestyle and include a house in Tschlin, near the Swiss border with Austria and Italy; a school in Niger; and his personal island abode, NotOna Island in Chile. \nFor \nVital's first major UK solo exhibition, Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP)\n has brought together a collection of the artist's diverse practice, including paintings and works on paper, indoor pieces made from plaster, silver, gold, marble, glass and coal, and outdoor sculptures in stainless steel and bronze.\nRELATED: History, nudity and innovation at London's largest photography event\nWhat can you tell us about the curation process for the exhibition? \nWell it's the first time time I've shown such large pieces of sculpture outside. One sculpture, which is about 100 meters long and called \"Let 100 Flowers Bloom\" -- it's named after an essay by Mao from the 1950s -- has been shown in five different locations but this is the first time it's been placed outside. \nOf course if you place (sculptures) outside in nature, you're always going to be a loser because when a sculpture that is seven meters tall is set against a tree that is thirteen (meters tall), the sculpture is always going to lose. So this is the main challenge for me, being in this landscape. \nHave you created specific pieces for the YSP show? \nYes, there are a few, but I'm still working on creating a bridge that will be installed on one side of the park. It's still in the making in Beijing but it will arrive around a month after the opening of the show. \nAbout eight years ago I made seven models for a sculpture of a bridge but so far I've only realized one -- this will be the second. Of course it takes a long time to realize a piece such as the bridge, we've been working on it for the last six months.\nHow has the process of house building and the way you've traveled \nfed into your creative process? \nWell I've been building houses -- tree houses -- since I was a child in Switzerland because we had so much time off school, so that became a very important moment in my life. \nI've always wanted to get back to that sensation, that initial passion I got from building habitats in the trees. When I went to Africa I continued to do that. I call it Scart, which is sculptural architecture that also has a social aspect. \nBut all these houses have no real infrastructure, they're more like sculptures. They can be lived in but they have a very specific purpose.\nOf course it depends on what landscape and environment you're in but that is always the first impulse when approaching a subject like that. \nRELATED: A bridge too far? 11 spectacular new bridges that break the mold\nWhen did you decide to spend half the year in China and how has that affected your work? \nI'd spent quite a lot of time in New York and during the late 90s I was traveling more and more and so decided to give up my space there. \nI needed another studio so I went to Beijing which is actually very similar to living in New York in the 80s. You have the space, a great community of artists and fantastic workers -- I've always said my assistants are technically much better than me. \nI was able to build a wonderful studio so it's really a wonderful environment in which to create. But also, you simply stay in your studio and work because outside is not always particularly inviting -- sometimes there is not even air outside -- so you just stay inside and work. \nIt's just perfect for me to spend at least four months a year in China and in those four months you produce so much more work than you would elsewhere, maybe as much as I would in three years in Switzerland. \nThere I live in a valley where it's almost too beautiful to work. I built a studio that has no windows because you just become distracted and you end up doing nothing. \nWhat have been the philosophical or technological changes in the way you approach your art over the years? \nWell that's quite complex. About two months ago I was in Laos, walking along the Mekong River, where I met an old woman making paper and I began to make it with her. An hour before I had never done this. \nI believe that if you keep yourself open to these kinds of situations, you can embrace so many different things. This was one of them. \nIn two days I made 40 pieces of paper (that are being shown here in the gallery) and ever since I've been traveling I've always found something new. I take all the possibilities that are given to me. \nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.

", "A species in danger: Who holds the moral high ground?": "Both know that there are fewer than 5,000 of them left on the planet. Both shudder at the thought of this ancient species going extinct in their lifetimes.\nThey agree that the voracious Asian demand for rhino horn as a status symbol is fueled by ignorance and greed. They agree that the gangs of violent poachers who supply this black market must be stopped at all costs. But that is where their agreement ends, because one man carries a camera while the other carries a gun.\nOne is convinced that strict hunting bans and high-end photo tourism can save Africa's iconic creatures from extinction. \nThe other believes that without the big-game hunter, there would be no big game. He argues that a man willing to spend a small fortune to shoot a rhino, lion or elephant is the best incentive poor African nations have to protect their wildlife.\nSo who's right? Which man holds the moral high ground? And in this age of manmade mass extinction, which one's ideas will save the black rhino?\nThese are the questions that sent \"The Wonder List\" on safari, from the searing deserts of Namibia to the lush delta of Botswana. \nWe picked these nations because they are neighbors with very different ideas about species protection. \nIt turned out to be a good choice, because we encountered some of the most incredible wildlife scenes ever filmed and some of the most passionate debates in conservation. \nA few years back, Botswana banned hunting. Private game farms still exist, but on state-owned land like the Okavango Delta, animals enjoy the highest level of protection in Africa. \nMeanwhile, next door in Namibia, tightly regulated \"sustainable-use conservation\" allows for hunting even the most endangered of species.\nIn 2014, the government auctioned off a black rhino hunt to a Texas oil heir, Corey Knowlton, for $350,000. \nNamibian wildlife managers rationalized this by identifying a specific rhino for the hunt -- one that was old, aggressive and well past breeding prime -- and they vowed that the money would go back into rhino conservation. \nBut for countless animal lovers, that logic is cold comfort. \nKnowlton received thousands of angry messages and dozens of death threats, while Zimbabwe's Cecil the lion and the Minnesota dentist who shot him created the kind of firestorm that makes it reasonable to wonder: Which will go extinct first, the black rhino or the Great White Hunter? \n ", "World's most spectacular toilets": "At least they now have a handy guide.\nBackpacker bible Lonely Planet has published a handsome new book that collects photos of some of the world's more interesting restrooms.\nMore than 100, ranging from pop-up pissoirs on the back streets of London to clifftop drops in Tanzania, are gathered in \"\nToilets: A Spotter's Guide\n.\"\nSome are humble stick-made affairs, located in forsaken corners where few travelers would wish to linger. \nOthers are lavishly appointed \"works of art\" that offer incredible views alongside the most comfortable of comfort breaks.\n\"As any experienced traveler knows, you can tell a whole lot about a place by its bathrooms,\" the book's introduction says. \n\"Whatever you prefer to call them -- lavatory, loo, bog, khasi, thunderbox, dunny, washroom or water closet -- toilets are a (sometimes opaque, often wide open) window into the secret soul of a destination.\"\nClick through the above the gallery to see some of the best.\nThen, just to be on the safe side, wash your hands.\nMORE: 18 things we love on vacation but hate at home\nMORE: Grossest restaurant ever?

They were the first group of active-duty and combat-wounded service members to make the summit.\nJukes, a single-leg amputee, was striving to be the first combat-wounded veteran to summit Everest. But he was surpassed last week by Marine Staff Sgt. Charlie Linville, whose right leg was amputated below the knee after an improvised explosive blast gravely injured his right foot in Afghanistan. Linville climbed with \nThe Heroes Project\n, a  veterans' organization that leads expeditions with wounded veterans and active-duty service members. He tried to summit twice previously, in 2014 and 2015. \nLinville and Jukes don't know each other but were aware they were both eyeing the same goal due to media coverage. Both USX and The Heroes Project chose to summit Everest on the north side, which is less crowded but more technically challenging. \n\"The North Col head wall is a 1,000-feet-plus vertical ice wall with dangerous crevasses, steep pitches and dangerous s\u00e9racs,\" Earls said. \nBefore joining the Army, Jukes pursued rock climbing during high school. During his service, he was a lead gun truck commander on a supply convoy in northern Iraq when his vehicle was struck by an IED on December 17, 2006. \nThe blast shattered his heel bone and broke his femur. He contracted MRSA in the operating room and it destroyed the many bone fragments in his heel. But anyone who assumed that this would prevent the outdoor enthusiast from scaling a rock face again couldn't be more wrong. \nJukes chose to have his right leg amputated below his knee. A customized prosthesis that could be modified to suit his active interests of climbing and biking gave him hope.\nAlthough he battled waves of PTSD after losing his leg, Jukes found solace and relief through being in nature. Rather than be deterred by his amputation, he started climbing even more, even taking up ice climbing. \nInspired by the first blind man to summit Everest, Erik Weihenmayer, he reached out to the climber. Weihenmayer invited him to climb Bridal Veil Falls in Telluride, Colorado. In the winter, the falls freeze over, forming 365 feet of demanding, steep, overhanging ice. They scaled it together in February 2009. \nJukes also connected with No Barriers USA, a nonprofit that \"empowers people to break through barriers, find their inner purpose and contribute their very best to the world.\" In 2010, Jukes, Weihenmayer and 10 veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and suffered the physical and emotional toll of war set out to climb Mount Lobuche, one of the tallest in the Himalayas. Their story was captured in the 2012 documentary \"High Ground.\" \nLast year, No Barriers connected Jukes with USX, an organization with the initial goal of having the first active-duty male and female soldiers summit Mount Everest. Jukes agreed, eager to take on the challenge and represent his fellow combat-wounded veterans on the world's highest peak. But he was also motivated by the chance to raise awareness for PTSD, which is an Everest of its own for those who live with it each day. \nAfter climbing Everest, Jukes hopes to teach other people with physical disabilities how to climb because he loves being able to share the challenge of the experience with others. \n\"Over the past several weeks, our team has been presented with many unique challenges,\" Jukes said. \"Through teamwork and tenacity, we have been able to address and overcome every challenge we've faced.\" ", "The man who takes vacations in war zones": "Drury, 50, has a route traced out across the Kurdish-held territories, which runs close to the \nfrontline with ISIS\n.\n\"It's a difficult question -- how much risk to take?\" he ponders. \"You can go right up with the Kurdish troops fighting beyond Mosul. I want to see the Yazidis again... to see if the tribe I met are still alive.\"\nThe Englishman has fond memories of Yazidi hospitality from a previous stay, during a previous war.\nIt was one of his favorite trips.\nLooking for adventure\nFor more than 20 years, Drury has led a double life.\nHe's a husband, father and the owner of a successful construction company in rural Surrey, a short drive from London.\nBut his passion lies in visiting the world's most dangerous destinations, and his appetite is insatiable.\nThe flame was lit on a safari trip to Uganda, which took a strange turn when Drury accidentally crossed a border into war-ravaged Democratic Republic of Congo, and was forced to flee a machete-wielding farmer.\nSince then, the builder's travels have taken in downtown Mogadishu and the insurgent heartlands of Afghanistan. \nHe says he's dodged Russian soldiers in the bombed out ruins of Chechnya, infiltrated a Ku Klux Klan militia, played golf in Pyongyang and stayed with a former headhunting tribe in Myanmar. \n\"It's risk and reward,\" Drury explains. \"The reward is that you see more, and you learn more. We're not born to do nine to five jobs. You have to explore a little bit and try to understand the world you're living in.\"\nThere's an element of thrill seeking, Drury admits, but his attitude has changed over time. At first he would travel with a cousin and the two would dare each other to take risks.\nBut in recent years he has traveled alone, and become closer to local communities. \nHe's now the sponsor of a basketball team in his favorite city, Mogadishu, and returns to watch it play. \nDrury enjoys getting behind the headlines and takes every opportunity to set the record straight, as he sees it. \n\"People in England think Somalians are all gang members and drug dealers... not the people I know,\" he says. \"They are loving people who do their best and put their life on the line for you.\"\nHead down, eyes open\nFor destinations such as Syria, Drury crafts an itinerary with specialist operators that provide a local security detail. \nHe researches each location in advance and after arriving.    \n\"If I'm going to Kirkuk [in Iraq], I'll learn what road I'm taking there, what the village is like, what their allegiance is,\" says Drury. \"So if anything did happen to me, I would have some local knowledge.\" \nBut from his experience, communities living with chaos often welcome tourists as a rare taste of normality, and chance meetings can lead to memorable experiences. \nOne such encounter was with a currency forger in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\n\"He was the worst forger ever,\" recalls Drury. \"He gave us a note that was wet and by the time we left it had no ink.\"\nDrury and his cousin gave the man an English banknote to test his skills on, and quickly discovered they shared a love of cricket. The forger would eventually guide them through an alternative tour of the city, including a secret smuggler's bazaar.  \nIn areas where a British hostage could be valuable, Drury has learned to bite his tongue.\n\"Don't tell people where you're going the next day, even if you trust them,\" he advises. \"If people want to meet again I say I'm catching a flight tomorrow.\"\nThe Englishman has also learned to stay quiet through regular encounters with intelligence services -- from U.S. \"laundry men\" in Kurdistan to a hidden floor in a Pyongyang hotel.  \nDespite the constant danger, Drury says he no longer fears violence.\n\"Now it's more fear of not being frightened. I should be -- fear keeps you alert.\"\nPushing the boundaries\nSeveral of Drury's trips have been arranged through \nUntamed Borders\n, an operator with a record of notable firsts -- the first to offer skiing vacations to Afghanistan, and the first British company to tour Chechnya. \nFounder James Willcox rejects the \"danger tourism\" label, saying such trips offer a rich travel experience.\n\"We take people to places that are difficult to access and give them a variety of experiences -- the geopolitical stories... the culture and history,\" says Willcox. \n\"We try to see countries for the complex places they are and not a broad stereotype.\"\nThe company draws on a global network of guides and security experts to enable vacations in danger zones. \nEach trip requires months of planning, leaving nothing to chance. \nPart of the planning stage is gaming worst-case scenarios.\n\"You have to look at where you're going in a city if an attack happens,\" says Willcox. \n\"You need to have a number of places to take guests.\" \nIn emergencies, the company office becomes a control center to direct rescue operations, with staff gathering information for local partners or relevant authorities.   \nIngle Internationa\nl specializes in insuring high-risk trips, with operatives on the ground in many danger zones. But a surge of inexperienced visitors to conflict zones is stretching capacity.   \n\"We cover emergency evacuation -- within limits,\" says CEO Robin Ingle. \"If [people] are in a war-torn area we may not be able to get them out.\"\nRequests for coverage in Iraq and Syria are increasingly popular, he says. \nSome come from potential fighters -- who are rejected. \nNew horizons\nTrends in the wider travel industry suggest such vacation choices are becoming more common.\nThe adventure tourism market has exploded in recent years, with an estimated value of \n$265 billion\n.  \nMuch of the growth is coming through wider access to \"soft\" adventures such as cycle tours and safaris, says Shannon Stowell, president of the \nAdventure Travel Trade Association\n, but there's also more interest in hostile environments.\n\"All the buzz is for destinations that have some sort of edge,\" says Stowell. \n\"Myanmar, Cuba and even North Korea are starting to pop up on radars,\" says Stowell. \"There's intrigue -- people wonder what's behind the wall -- and a feeling of danger.\"\nThere's also growing fascination with death and disaster sites. \nChernobyl\n and \nAuschwitz\n are seeing record visitor numbers and the \nKilling Fields\n are one of Cambodia's leading attractions.  \nDeath draws a crowd\nVisitors to such sites are often looking for understanding, believes Dr. Philip Stone, head of the \nInstitute for Dark Tourism Research\n. \n\"Dark tourism suggests a morbid fascination with death, but it's more about living and connecting with our world, politics and heritage,\" says Stone. \n\"In a secular society... the Internet and tourism can provide meaning.\"\nDeath has always drawn crowds since the gladiators of Rome, says Stone, but increased interest has raised moral questions. \nHe'd like to restrain the entrepreneurial tendencies that made instant attractions of New Orleans after \nHurricane Katrina\n and the crash site of United Airlines \nFlight 93\n, and ensure such sites carry a strong message.  \n\"There is often a fine line between commercialization and memorialization,\" he says.\n\"The tourism industry must look at the messages presented at these places -- the history, heritage, politics -- and what visitors are taking away with them.\"\nIf managed respectfully, Stone believes that disaster sites can broaden the mind in the best traditions of travel.  \nFew tourists are ready to book their vacation in Iraq just yet. \nBut as more travelers demand experiences with a sharper edge than all-inclusive vacations can provide, the world's darkest corners are opening for business.

The small room, staffed 24/7, monitors every flight in Israeli airspace, including transit flights and nearby aircraft.\nEach flight, each passenger, and each member of the flight crew are checked long before arriving in Israeli airspace. There is never a moment without pressure. An off-course aircraft or a flight without proper security clearance is flagged immediately.\nMORE: Airport security: Can attacks be prevented?\nDvir Rubinshtein, manager of the operations center for Israel's Ministry of Transportation, estimates that 10 flights a day are flagged and checked. Since Ben Gurion is Israel's only major international airport, shutting down the airport would effectively cut off Israel from the air.\n\"There is, every day, a situation where we have such concerns [about a flight],\" said Rubinshtein, \"and we check that and verify that everything is security cleared.\"\nNext month, Ben Gurion airport will host visitors from 40 different countries to discuss airport security, officials say. \nInterest in Israeli airport security has grown after the attacks in Brussels, the crash of MetroJet Flight 9268, and now EgyptAir Flight 804. \nBen Gurion is a relatively small airport -- the airport handles about 20% of the passengers of London's Heathrow International Airport and 15% of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, which just signed a cooperation agreement with Ben Gurion.\nSome of the security measures employed at the airport are not scalable to larger hubs, but \"some fundamental principles and some best practices can be deployed in other parts of the world,\" said aviation security expert Shalom Dolev. \"It's not a copy and paste because it's not a situation where one size fits all.\"\nCritics have accused both Israel and the United States of racial profiling as part of their aviation security procedures. \nDolev says it is risk-based security. Palestinians and Arabs passing through Ben Gurion say they are more likely to be stopped, searched, and questioned. Last year, Israel's High Court of Justice refused to ban racial profiling in a case brought by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. The court did leave the door open for the group to file a case in the future.\nSecurity expert Dolev says the Israeli tactics are risk-based security and don't amount to \"profiling.\"\nIn the United States, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has touted its evolution from a \"one-size-fits-all security screening approach to a risk-based, intelligence-driven strategy.\" \nBut that strategy, which includes a Behavior Detection and Analysis program that the agency says is scientifically substantiated, has long been criticized by passengers, security analysts and civil liberties advocates as flawed and discriminatory.\nMORE: World's busiest airports announced\nThe American Civil Liberties Union sued for records related to the program in 2015 to gauge the program's effectiveness.\n\"Most of the countries are actually coming here often to see how Israel is dealing with security aviation and the threats from terror aviation,\" Rubinshtein said.\nIn February, Israel issued a security directive to airlines flying to Israel. The directive adds security checks to each flight.\n\"The circles of threat are further expanding to insiders working at the airports,\" said Dolev. \n\"Insiders that are working at resorts and may have access to the luggage of passengers, insiders that may work at airports or even in cabin crew. And last but not least, the phenomenon we are facing since the early-90s of suicide pilots.\"\nAsked what makes Israel different, Dolev says, \"We are more flexible, more dynamic to respond to emerging threats and respond effectively.\"\n ", "Engine cover falls off during turbulent flight": "Looking out the window and seeing the plane's innards on display? Not so much. \nPassengers aboard Delta Air Lines Flight 762 from Atlanta to Chicago got a little more than sloshed drinks when the cabin lights came on at 28,000 feet Sunday afternoon. \nThose with a window seat got quite the view: The piece covering the plane's right engine -- or cowling, as it's called --  had come off. \nAs photos posted by \nCNN affiliate WTVF showed\n, the loose piece then appeared to have struck part of the fuselage. \nThe pilot declared an emergency, and the plane landed safely in Nashville. \nThe 109 passengers aboard the Boeing 717 walked away uninjured, but with quite a tale to tell. \nDelta said it's been in touch with passengers with \"a gesture of apology.\" And it's investigating exactly what went wrong.

", "Is France's Gascony the new Bordeaux?": "But Bordeaux better watch out.\nOn the scene is a recent challenger, the lesser-known region of Gascony.\nSituated in southwest France at the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains, just east of the French Basque coast and on the Spanish border, Gascony is a classic French destination.\nIt's a hilly stretch of countryside dotted with dense forest, sunflower fields and medieval chateau. \nAnd, of course, vineyards.\nThe remarkable wines these vineyards are now producing have, in recent years, helped Gascony step into the spotlight.\nThere are rich, bold reds that could stand up to any glass of Bordeaux, as well as crisp, floral whites that are refreshing and easy to drink.\n\"Unlike most Bordeaux wines, which require aging, Gascony's wines are meant to be enjoyed now, while they're young,\" says Remy Grassa, winemaker and co-owner of Domaine du Tariquet, Gascony's largest producer. \nThey're better value too.\nUnorthodox techniques\n\"Gascon wines also have a fantastic price-to-quality ratio that you don't really see in Bordeaux,\" Grassa adds.\nTariquet, established in 1972, spearheaded the transformation of the wine business in Gascony from a flailing industry into the pioneering wine region it is today. \nGrassa's father, Yves, merged traditional French winemaking methods with unorthodox \"new world\" techniques.\nThe result: the arrival of fresh, vibrant wines to southwestern France -- a region historically prized for its aged, \"old world\" wines. \nNow, Gascony has about 1,200 wineries and produces more than 100 million bottles per year.\nThere's a mix of dry, aromatic whites made from native grapes like petit manseng and ugni blanc, and velvety reds made from tannat and cabernet franc. \nAdded bonus? The price.\nThe average Gascon wine retails for just $10 in the United States -- far more affordable than the average Bordeaux, which costs upward of $75.   \n\"Making cost-effective wine, without sacrificing any quality, is so important for us,\" says Grassa. \n\"We want our wines to be something you can enjoy every day, and not just reserved for special occasions.\"\nEveryday enjoyment\nIn Gascony, this \"everyday enjoyment\" extends far beyond just a daily glass of wine.\nPursuit of pleasure is seen as a key part of the Gascon lifestyle.\nHere, foie gras isn't a luxury or delicacy, but an everyday staple.\nIt's slathered thickly on hunks of bread, stuffed into prunes, baked into eggs, pan-seared and served alone, or alongside grilled duck breast. \nGascon foie gras is considered the best in the country, homemade by local farmers in small batches and sold directly to consumers from farmhouse kitchens. \nIn recent years, local restaurants like \nLe Loft\n and \nLa Vie en Rose\n have made efforts to elevate traditional Gascon farmhouse fare for visitors, adding balsamic glaze and grilled peaches to seared foie, and wrapping duck pate-stuffed prunes in bacon.\nBut even with updated culinary offerings, the food scene in Gascony remains unpretentious, characterized by cozy bistro-style dining and modest chefs more interested in filling bellies than collecting Michelin stars. \nFrance's 'secret' brandy\n\"We have always loved to eat good food here in Gascony -- our local food is delicious, but it's also simple,\" says Benoit Hillion of \nBas-Armagnac Dartigalongue\n, the oldest brandy producer in the region.\nAccording to Hillion, Gascons aren't interested in following culinary trends, nor being branded as the next big \"foodie destination.\"\nTheir focus? \nTo make the highest quality products to be enjoyed locally. \nThere are few better examples of this than Armagnac, Gascony's honey-colored signature brandy and the lesser-known cousin of Cognac. \nArmagnac's quality arguably surpasses that of Cognac -- it's distilled only once, making it the purer brandy -- yet is little-known outside of France. (It's affectionately known as \"the brandy the French keep for themselves.\") \nMany spirits connoisseurs see Armagnac's obscurity as a shame, an unfortunate outcome of investment in Cognac by luxury goods conglomerates like LVMH.\nBut Gascons aren't concerned.\n\"We're not competing with Cognac -- they're much better at marketing than we are,\" says Hillion. \"Plus, we're proud to have a craft product.\"\nHe admits that they'd love to sell more Armagnac, but says that Gascon producers would rather maintain quality rather than increase volume too quickly. \n\"Our focus is our terroir, our barrels and our families.\"\nMORE: France's most beautiful destinations\nTuscany of France\nLike its wines, food and Armagnacs, there's nothing subtle about Gascony's dramatic landscape, which lies between the mountains and the ocean.\n\"Unlike Bordeaux, Gascony has more than just vineyards,\" says Grassa. \"We have a real countryside: hills, sunflower fields, cornfields, forests, lakes, and changing colors throughout the seasons. \n\"When it comes to our landscape, Gascony is very similar to Tuscany.\"\nLike Italy's Tuscany, the region is scattered with charming villages.\nFources is home to the only round square in France.\nLavardens is a medieval hamlet with a beautiful 12th-century castle.\nMontreal-du-Gers is an ancient fortified village on the banks of the river Auzoue.\nOn the outskirts of each village, among the vineyards, are numerous beautiful gites: country cottages, often part of a farm or estate, that are often rented out for tourism.\nIn the absence of major hotel chains, gites are the best option for accommodation in the region, offering not just affordable lodging but immersion into Gascon culture. \nAt \nFerme de Mounet Gascon\n duck farmers Monique and Bernard Molas offer a cozy one-bedroom gite with its own private pool, steps away from the barn.\nGuests aren't only encouraged to take part in day-to-day farm tasks, they're invited to enjoy Monique's home cooking at dinner with the family each evening.\nCasual swigs\nFor a more typical hotel experience, family-owned estates like \nLa Belle vie de Chateau \noffer spacious rooms with amenities such as deep-soaking marble tubs.\nUnlike Bordeaux or Champagne, there are no major chain hotels, celebrity chef restaurants or Louis Vuitton-owned wineries in Gascony.\nInstead, there are duck farm gites and family-run chateau, roadside foie gras, obscure wines and artisanal brandies.\nInstead of well-trodden wine trails, there are hand-painted signposts along rugged country roads.\nInstead of formal group tastings, there are casual swigs of Armagnac with winemakers.\nCompared with Bordeaux, Gascony barely feels like a tourist destination at all.\nWhich is part of its appeal.\n\"Gascon people just want to eat good food, and drink good wine and Armagnac,\" adds Hillion. \n\"Here, it's just about enjoying life.\"", "Bourdain's 'enchanting' visit to Senegal": "So let this episode in Senegal, an African nation which is over 90% Muslim, serve as both rebuke and example.\nIt is a country that proudly elected as their first president after independence, a Christian--because they felt, in their best judgment, that regardless of his faith, he was the best person for the job.  \nIt is a country that defies stereotypes and expectations at every turn. \nEmerging from French colonial times as a functioning multicultural, multilingual, extraordinarily TOLERANT society. \nIt has managed to avoid coups,  tribal wars, dictatorships and most of the ills that afflicted so many of its neighbors and remains an absolutely enchanting place to visit, with delicious food, absolutely extraordinarily beautiful music, and a relatively free and easy attitude towards intermarriage, mixed race and inter-tribal relationships, and foreign visitors. \nIt has a powerful and proud tradition of hospitality that endures to this day. \nSo, in addition to showing you a slice of the beauty of the country and its people, we ask the question, or at least leave it hanging: What do these people think--who have always looked admiringly at America and its democratic institutions--of the kind of hateful, fearful, small minded ranting that actually passes for a platform these days? \nThat they are predominantly Sufi Muslims, with attitudes towards behavior far removed from the more loony toon, extreme brand of Islam we see too all often on the news, is a distinction unlikely to be made by haters, most of whom have difficulty (or simply don't care) to even distinguish Muslims from Sikhs. \nOne can drink a beer nearly anywhere in Senegal. One can choose to wear the traditional hijab--or not. (Most women from what I saw, do not. The elaborate hair weave seems more the thing). \nSenegal is one of the best arguments for travel I can think of. \nBecause the more we see of the world, actually meet who we are talking about--or think we are talking about, take a walk, however briefly, in other people's shoes, see how other people live, people who are supposedly so different than us, find ourselves--as so often and so inevitably happens--as recipients of random acts of hospitality and kindness from total strangers--then the better we shall be. \nAnd the happier. Knowledge--exposure--to the \"other\" is not a contaminant. \nIt enriches us. It makes--or should make us--more humble. \nSenegal. It's someplace that everyone, given the chance, should go.

When independence came, and we didn't have a state, we had no source of income.\"\n800-year legacy\nOriginally, Singh's family offered the property to the government \"for peanuts.\" \n\"That never happened, thank God,\" says Gaj Singh.\n\"What worried me the most, at that time, was that this was a legacy of 800 years. And what would come of it? \n\"To sustain you have to think ahead. You can't stand still.\"\nWith exquisite infrastructure already in place, converting to a luxury hotel was a relatively simple process.\nThe palace has perfectly manicured grounds, ornately carved gargoyles and charming personal butlers. \nUpon arrival at the sandstone structure, guests are met by a horse-drawn carriage, a drumline procession and rose petal showers. \nIndia's Taj Hotel Group now looks after the day-to-day operation of the hotel. \nSingh's role is that of iconic figurehead -- he's greeted enthusiastically by guests still enamored with India's royal past. \nOn living next to a hotel he says, \"I've always told all the managers to please remember that this is not just a hotel, it is a palace.

Germany came in 16th place, while other superpowers -- the United Kingdom (23), Japan (53), Russia (56) and China (83) -- were markedly lower. \nSome countries that saw drops suffered economic and political turmoil -- including Greece, Italy and Spain -- while Ukraine's political trouble and violence likely caused a significant drop in happiness there. \nMeasuring happiness is important\nHappiness is a better measure of human welfare than measuring education, health, poverty, income and good government separately, the report's editors argue. \nThere are at least seven key ingredients of happiness: People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies, have more social support, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption, experience more generosity, experience less inequality of happiness and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows.\n\"Measuring self-reported happiness and achieving well-being should be on every nation's agenda as they begin to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the report's co-editor and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, in a statement. \n\"Indeed the goals themselves embody the very idea that human well-being should be nurtured through a holistic approach that combines economic, social and environmental objectives,\" Sachs said. \"Rather than taking a narrow approach focused solely on economic growth,we should promote societies that are prosperous, just, and environmentally sustainable.\" \nNot just about the money\nIceland and Ireland both suffered through banking crises that dramatically affected their economies but didn't greatly affect their happiness, according to the report. What both countries have is a high degree of social support, enough to put Iceland in third place and Ireland in 19th place this year, according to the report. \nStrictly focusing on financial well-being can obscure the larger picture, according to the University of British Columbia's John Helliwell.\n\"In Norway, it's quite common for people to paint each other's houses even though they can all afford to pay to have their houses painted,\" said Helliwell, a report co-editor and co-director of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.\n\"They go out of their way to help each other, and it becomes a social event, and those events are enormously supportive of well-being,\" Helliwell said. \"In the commercialization of activity -- when people are more likely to buy things than to do them for themselves and each other -- we lose something along the way.\"\nInequality of happiness\nIt turns out that people are also happier in countries where there's less inequality of well-being, the report found. And happiness inequality has increased significantly \"in most countries and regions of the world,\" said Helliwell, comparing 2012-15 data with 2005-11 data. \nThe country of Bhutan, a tiny country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, ranked No. 1 in happiness equality, followed by Comoros and the Netherlands. South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Liberia had the highest happiness inequality. \nA country may have really rich and really poor people, and the poor people don't have enough money to construct a good life for themselves, he said. Or people may have money but have no social support or friends, or live in an area where there's government corruption or lack of freedom to make their own life choices.  \nThe birth of 'Gross National Happiness'\nIt's no surprise that Bhutan would come out on top, despite not being a world economic power: Its Prime Minister proposed a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011 and launched this international focus on happiness.\nFollowing in Bhutan's footsteps, \nthe U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012\n, recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world.\"  \nIn recent years, other countries have made happiness a public policy goal of their governments. Bhutan, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela have all appointed \"Minsters of Happiness\" to focus on the happiness of their people. ", "9 reasons to visit Georgia now": "Sandwiched between the Caucasus Mountains to the north, the Black Sea to the west and dry deserts to the south, this small country, which borders Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey, is not only a crossroads of cultures, but has a wealth of spectacular landscapes. \nUntil recently, many would have struggled to place the country of Georgia on the map (or at least mistake it for the U.S. state of the same name), but it's quickly becoming one of Europe's hottest new destinations.\nHere are nine reasons to visit Georgia now.  \n1. Tbilisi: An eclectic melting pot \nFrom the hanging balconies in the crumbling Old Tbilisi district and the Persian-style sulfur baths clad in turquoise mosaics, to unique art nouveau buildings falling into disrepair sitting side by side with futuristic glass structures, \nTbilisi\n is a city that inspires. \nThe Georgian capital lies on the banks of the Mtkvari River and is surrounded by mountains on all three sides. \nArcheologists trace the first settlement in today's Tbilisi to the 4th millennium B.C. \nIts position on the old Silk Road turned it into a multicultural hub, reflected today in the city's ethnic diversity and eclectic architecture.\nThe baths in Abanotubani follow the Persian tradition, only the thermal water bubbles up naturally from the ground below. \nTbilisi gets its name from the Old Georgian word \"tbili,\" meaning warm, due to its hot, sulfurous water. \nMoving away from Abanotubani, a walk into the Old Town reveals old Georgian and Armenian churches, mosques and synagogues and even the ruins of the most northern Zoroastrian fire temple. \n2. Ushguli: Europe's highest village \nWay up in the Caucasus Mountains around 2,200 meters above sea level, this small village is Europe's highest continuously inhabited settlement. \nSitting at the foot of Mount Shkhara, Georgia's highest point, Ushguli is famous for the medieval defensive towers connected to each house.\nIt's deep in the Svaneti region, known for its unique culture that was once cut off from the rest of the country.\nThe main town of Mestia is on its way to becoming the Georgian equivalent of a Swiss resort but Ushguli has been saved by its poor transport routes, which have helped preserve the village's timeless feel. \nYoung men gallop through the dirt tracks on horseback between the crumbling towers, dodging the livestock in the street. \nUshguli and the region of Upper Svaneti\n are classified as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. \n3. The birthplace of wine \nWhen we think of the origin of wine we tend to think of France, Italy, Greece or Persia, but Georgia is in fact one of the world's oldest wine regions. \nIn 2003, archaeologists found evidence that Stone Age people were producing wine here up to 8,000 years ago.\nSince then, wine has played a core part in Georgia's national identity.\nThe country's ancient tradition of fermenting grape juice in clay vessels, known as \nkvevris\n, has made it onto UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list. \nThere are hundreds of indigenous grape varieties, and Georgian wine is slowly gaining recognition globally.\nWhile some of the homemade varieties aren't particularly palatable, there are some excellent vineyards in Georgia producing premium wines. \nA good place to start is with a red wine aged in oak barrels made from the Saperavi grape from Mukuzani in the wine region of Kakheti, such as those from \nTeliani Valley\n, or a white Tsindali, made from a blend of Rkatsteli and Mtvani grapes. \nSoviet dictator and Georgian native Joseph Stalin was a fan of Khvanchkara, a sweet red wine from the Racha mountain region in the Caucasus. \n4. Mysterious cave cities \nGeorgia is home to some of the most unusual cave cities in Europe. \nBy themselves, they're reason alone to visit the country. \nThe oldest is \nUplitstsikhe\n, an ancient settlement that resembles a lunar landscape. \nOthers include Davit Gareja, a vast monastic complex carved into the rock of Mount Gareja, and \nVardzia\n, a spectacular underground city that once housed 2,000 monks. \n5. Supra: A traditional Georgian feast \nOne of the best ways to get to know the country is through its \nfood\n.\nIn fact, if you haven't tried a Georgian \nsupra\n, or feast, you haven't experienced Georgia. \nThe local cheese bread is called \nkhachapuri\n, the most famous being the Adjaran variety. \nIt's a baked bread boat filled with gooey, melted, tangy \nsulguni\n cheese, a whole egg yolk and some slivers of butter. Yes, it's heart stopping, but so delicious. \n Khinkhali \ndumplings come with a spiced meat filling that releases its juices when cooked, so you have to suck out the stock before eating. \nThen there are delectable walnut dressing salads, bean stews cooked with fragrant cilantro and \nshashlik\n, tender marinated meat cooked on a kebab skewer. \nThey're best enjoyed, of course, with some excellent Georgian wine. \n6. Remote mountain villages\nThe remote regions of Khevsureti and Tusheti in the Caucasus Mountains are home to spectacular medieval villages with small communities that still retain their ancient pagan traditions.\nThe roads going up here are an adrenaline rush in themselves.  \nThe ruined fortress of Mutso and the settlement of Shatili in Khevsureti look like something described by J.R.R. Tolkien. \nSet dramatically against the mountains, they're so close to Chechnya you can see the border guards walking up and down the ridge. \nTusheti\n is a cluster of communities, kind of like a Georgian Shangri La, full of old towers, churches, villages and spectacular mountain scenery with wild flowers and trees with leaves that almost look golden. \nTusheti has numerous hiking trails and the locals are known for their generous mountain hospitality. \n7. Europe's most surreal museum \nTo learn about the life of Old Joe, visit Stalin's hometown, Gori, and the bizarre Joseph Stalin Museum. \nYou might know Stalin as a dictator responsible for millions of deaths, but in this hometown attraction there is a sense of pride about the \"local boy made good.\"\nThere aren't any references to his purges beyond a small backroom that doesn't feature on the tour, but there are pictures aplenty of Stalin, including one of the leader voting for himself.\nThere are also various statues, his death mask, carpets and frescoes featuring the dear leader's face, his personal green railway carriage and -- the star attraction -- his one-bedroom childhood home preserved in perfect condition. \nThe museum has been criticized for being a \"falsification of history\" and an example of \"Soviet propaganda.\"\nThere were plans to transform the museum into a museum of Russian aggression, but so far this is limited to a little room hidden beside the entrance. \nThe museum is worth visiting as it captures the essence of Stalin, including his own self-glorification and propaganda, even if that was not its intended purpose. \n8. Beautiful and ancient churches\nGeorgia adopted Christianity back in 324 AD and the country is full of spectacular churches and cathedrals in incredible locations. \nWhether it's the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of \nMtskheta's Svetitskhoveli Cathedral\n or \nKutaisi's Bagrati Cathedral\n, or the dramatic hill top position of the church in Kazbegi, Georgia's churches never fail to paint a pretty picture. \nKazbegi is also home to one of the world's most spectacular marathon routes. \nYou can cheer on runners in this year's \nKazbegi Trail Marathon\n on September 5, 2015.  \n9. The people and Georgian hospitality  \nGeorgians might appear a serious bunch at first, but most are kind and welcoming. \nFor Georgians, a guest is a sacred thing, and they will often go out of their way to help you. \nTheir generosity and hospitality will often take the form of lots of food and even more drink. \nAs they say in Georgia, \"Gaumarjos!\" (Cheers!).

No, not Sicily 1922 (But I appreciate you are a Golden Girls fan, much like myself! And in case you didn't get that reference, no worries; read on!), but February 29, 2016. It was a Monday night and I was getting so excited for my upcoming trip to visit my sister, brother-in-law, and niece who was about to turn 6 months old that Thursday! I started to feel a little sinus pressure that night, nothing major but enough to give me pause. As I woke up that next day on Tuesday, March 1st, I felt OK, but things quickly went downhill. It was a cold, I thought; nothing major.\nBy Wednesday, March 2nd, things were escalating. My cold symptoms had intensified. I consulted with a virtual doctor-on-call using my computer (very fancy!), and she recommended I head right in and see an actual physician. \"Uh oh,\" I thought. \"That's not a great sign.\"\nI visited the doctor that evening and he was sufficiently concerned with my symptoms that he suggested I cancel my planned trip to Kansas City the following day. \"WHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYY,\" I wondered silently to myself. It seemed like a little cold, but alas, he concluded travel was unreasonable and issued me the enclosed note. Always a rule follower, I abided by his advice.\nAnd BOY am I glad I did! You'll see the doctor's note references an infectious disease. It was just two days later on March 4th, that I learned this infectious disease was not a household cold or flu: it was a Haemophilus Influenzae bacterial infection. Yes, the same infection that can cause conditions such as epiglottitis (a fatal respiratory disease), pneumonia, and notably, meningitis in children under 5. Remember when I mentioned I was going to visit my 6 month old niece?! Thank heavens I didn't!\nSuffice to say, after 2 long weeks of illness, which prompted a formal medical leave from work, I didn't suffer any of the severe complications (though I did have a sinus infection, ear infection including a ruptured eardrum, pink eye, throat infection, full-body rash, among others). But most of all, canceling my trip to visit my infant niece was the best thing that could have happened; had I visited her and she gotten sick, it literally could have killed her.\nAll that said, I'm hoping you may be able, or at least willing, to take pity on me and this woeful tale (as pitiful as it is), and forgo the $200 change fee normally imposed on tickets such as this. I know, I know, I purchased a nonrefundable ticket and that I took the risk that my I may face this fee if my trip were canceled. But I'm hoping you can see that this trip was canceled for very significant reasons, and that in addition to the pain and suffering I endured as a result of my illness, I was even more so upset that I couldn't see my family members whom I hadn't visited since November! A niece needs her uncle (that's a saying, right?)!\nNow, I don't know if this will be problematic or not, but I just recently rebooked my trip and I've already paid the $200 change fee. So I now realize there may be 356 reasons you can't refund this to me, but I figure it's always worth a shot! If it's possible in any way to recoup this $200 I'd be forever grateful.\nI know you must deal with testy and ornery travelers all the time, and I assure you I am not one of those. If I'm not able to recoup this cost, I'm most understanding. I thank you for all you do to make the travel dreams of flyers such as myself a reality.\nAnd in case this letter was too long or unclear, I've also included a photo-story of the whole ideal attached. \nThank you again for your kind consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and also to my next flight!\nWith gratitude,\nAlex Hamberger\nFrequent Flyer\nBrother\nUncle\nFormerly sick person\nCurrently healthy person\nGrateful flyer", "Standing up on whitewater: Why not?": "At its most exciting moments, participants end up in kind of a slipping-on-a-banana-peel stance.\nYet for those who love it, whitewater stand-up paddleboarding -- or whitewater SUPing -- holds a powerful allure.\nFor some, it brings a big thrill with a little less risk. \nThat's why paddling instructor Jack Nelson switched from kayaking to whitewater SUPing.\n\"I took some scary swims (in a kayak) and just thought, 'I don't know, if I stay with this group of guys that I've grown in the sport with, am I going to be one of those statistics that dies on the river?' \" said Nelson, 31, an American Canoe Association level 3 whitewater SUPing instructor who lives in Bristol, Tennessee.\nThen, Nelson started stand-up paddling on class II and III rapids, \"and I was like 'wow, this is amazing,' plus it's really hard. And in a kayak, that was boring.\"\nNow, he's competing professionally in stand-up paddleboarding and serves as lead SUPing instructor at river outfitter USA Raft when he's not working his day job as a high school criminal justice teacher. \nCertainly, paddling rapids while standing on a board makes the easier classes of whitewater harder.  \nClass II and III rapids that have become ho-hum in kayaks and rafts are exciting again when you're trying to stay on your feet amid the crash and swirl of water rushing through an only partially visible obstacle course of rocks.\nSo you get more SUP adrenaline on less treacherous stretches of river, armored with a helmet, a personal flotation device, river shoes and elbow and knee pads.\n\"We're all still nervous when we're running class IV and V whitewater, for sure. And, you know, that's part of why we do it,\" said Matt Moses, 45, owner of\n USA Raft\n and an avid whitewater stand-up paddleboarder. \n\"Personally, I enjoy class III whitewater. It's just fun and wet and splashy, and you still have to make some moves, but you don't feel like you're putting it all on the line,\" said Moses, whose company has a riverside location on the Nolichucky River in Erwin, Tennessee, and another outpost near the French Broad River in Marshall, North Carolina.\nStand-up paddleboarding goes wild\nThe whitewater SUP niche is growing, with pockets of paddlers popping up on rivers across the United States, but it's unlikely to catch up with the nearly ubiquitous flat-water version of stand-up paddling seen on bays, lakes and calm rivers.\nOnly about 10% of the 1,000 stand-up paddleboarding instructors certified by the nonprofit American Canoe Association are certified for whitewater, according to association Chief Operating Officer Chris Stec, but SUP participation has skyrocketed overall since the mid-2000s, when stand-up paddleboarding\n arrived in the continental U.S.\n as a recreational sport.\nIn fact, it's the fastest-growing outdoor activity in terms of participation, according to the \nOutdoor Industry Association (PDF)\n. Participation increased by 38% from 2013 to 2014, following a 29% increase the previous year.\nWhitewater stand-up paddleboarding enthusiast Michael Goforth, 45, calls it \"walking on water.\"\n\"I don't know how to describe it. It's so beautiful,\" said Goforth, who was paddling with Moses and some other friends in the Nolichucky River Gorge on a perfect, cloudless 80-degree day in August.\n\"It can be a really passive, intuitive thing. That's kind of what your goal is, is to let the water do all the work, and you use your paddle to assist when it's not perfect,\" said Goforth, a land surveyor who recently moved from North Carolina to Fredericktown, Missouri.\nManaging risks\nIt's not without its bumps, bruises and worse.  \nMoses, who tore a knee ligament while SUPing last year, always wears protective gear, sometimes opting for a helmet with a full face mask. He inspires a lot of comments on the river.\n\"People are just always like 'Really? You just came down that rapid I fell out of this raft in? You guys are crazy!'\n\"So we get a lot of looks, a lot of comments,\" Moses said. \"We wear full pads, so, you know, I've been called a Power Ranger and all sorts of things after we get padded up.\"\nRafters aren't the only incredulous river riders. \nKayakers are dubious, too\n.  \n\"They either think it's real easy, or they're just trying to ignore it and hope it goes away,\" said \nBarry Kennon\n, 44, a former C1 Kayak Freestyle World Champion who was burnt out on kayaking when he converted to stand-up paddling about five years ago. \nReady to try it?\nYou don't need decades of experience on whitewater to try this. Really.\nInstruction is a very good idea, though. Whitewater SUP instructors are working rivers across the U.S. with outfitters where rentals and gear are available. The American Canoe Association trains instructors, creates\n courses\n and offers \ngear guidance\n.\nAt USA Raft, about two in 20 flat-water SUPing customers decide to venture into getting some whitewater instruction, Moses estimates. \nThough there are no guarantees, a paddler who takes to it could be navigating small rapids on the lower Nolichucky within an hour, he said. \nReading the water, choosing your lines according to the currents and being prepared to swim make whitewater SUPing smoother. \nYou should also be prepared to fall. Ideally, you'll \"take a knee\" and stay on your board or fall into your board rather than taking a swim.\n\"Make yourself small; get your center of gravity low,\" Moses said. \"Try to hug that board. Kiss the deck instead of kissing a rock.\"\nUSA Raft \noffers two to three hours of personalized SUP instruction for $100 for one person, $150 for two, $175 for three and $200 for four people. Two-day weekend packages are also available.  800-872-7238.", "'Invisible' train set to roll in 2018": "Except it could actually happen. \nA nearly invisible train designed by one of Japan's leading architects is scheduled to debut in Tokyo in 2018. \nDesigned by award winner Kazuyo Sejima, the commuter train uses semi-reflective and semi-transparent materials to blend into the scenery whether it's traveling through the city or the countryside, \naccording to a Newsweek report\n. \nThe train \"travels in a variety of different sceneries, from the mountains of Chichibu to the middle of Tokyo, and I thought it would be good if the train could gently coexist with this variety of scenery,\" Sejima said.\nSejima founded the \nSANAA architecture firm \nwith Ryue Nishizawa in 1995.\nThe company is known for its use of light and space. \nSejima was commissioned to design the train in honor of the Seibu Group's 100th anniversary. \nThe company owns Seibu Railways, which operates train service around Tokyo and Saitama prefectures.\nAmong Sejima and Nishizawa's notable designs are the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York; the Serpentine Pavilion in London; the Rolex Learning Center in Lausanne, Switzerland; the Toledo Museum of Art's Glass Pavilion in Toledo, Ohio; and the Christian Dior Building in Omotesando in Tokyo.\n7 grand hotels with deep railroad roots\nSejima and Nishizawa were named \nPritzker Architecture Prize laureates in 2010\n, architecture's highest honor. \n\"They explore like few others the phenomenal properties of continuous space, lightness, transparency and materiality to create a subtle synthesis,\" according to the jurors' citation.

But it does happen (last year, there were about \n100 attacks \nworldwide). So, as you head to the beach, here are some tips to keep you from becoming shark snack.\nBe the bigger man\nSee a shark and think it's about to attack? Act \"big,\" because sharks respect size and strength, says shark expert George Burgess, director of the \nInternational Shark Attack File\n. And pop it on the nose. \"A smack to the nose is startling to a shark,\" he says. \nThrash about\nAttacks are rare; deaths are rarer (six worldwide last year). But if you do find yourself in the jaws of a great white -- or bull shark, or tiger shark -- don't play dead. \"If you play dead, you're going to be dead,\" says Burgess. Because the shark, after taking an exploratory bite of you, will think it's won the battle and will commence to chomping. \nFight! Fight! Fight!\nDeal with a shark like you would a neighborhood bully. \"So hit him, and maybe he'll go home to mommy,\" Burgess says. If you got something handy, like your selfie stick or scuba gear, smack the shark with it. Or just use bare hands and go for the nose, gills and eyes -- all sensitive areas. \nSpring for the shore\nSuccessfully fought off Jaws? Hightail it to the beach. That might sound obvious, but it makes sense. All of that splashing and commotion (not to mention the blood) is sure to attract other sharks that might be swimming by, says Burgess. Once on solid ground,  stop the bleeding and get help.\n---------------\nWhew, surely you don't ever want a repeat of that experience. So what should you differently next time? \nStay out of Florida\nOK, we're kidding (but only a little). The Sunshine State \nusually leads the world \nin unprovoked shark attacks. It had 30 last year. Makes sense if you think about it: lengthy coastline + throngs of tourists = shark buffet. \nDon't swim at night\nContrary to the joys \nMichael Stipe sings\n about, avoid night swimming, because you can't see the sharks coming. Also avoid mouths of rivers, inlets, channels and any place where fish congregate. \"Where there's fish, there's predators,\" Burgess says.\nDitch the bling \nLight reflecting off jewelry is a surefire shark draw. They think it's fish scales. So, leave those gold chains on the shore.

essential part of travel. \nFrom health retreats on Sicily's sun-kissed Mediterranean coast to high-end hammams in the Caribbean, we've handpicked the world's 10 best new spas, based on service, treatments, amenities and ambiance.\nRocco Forte Spa at Verdura Resort (Sicily, Italy)\nThere's no spa in Italy quite like the new, 43,000-square-foot \nRocco Forte Spa \non Sicily's southwest coast.\nFor starters, it sits on its own private stretch of coastline, with uninterrupted views of the Mediterranean from almost every angle.\nUnsurprisingly, the focus here is on thalassotherapy: the medicinal and therapeutic use of seawater and marine elements.\nIt has an extensive thalassotherapy circuit, consisting of four outdoor pools offering varying levels of salinity and heat.\nTreatments, like the Seaweed Body Scrub ($130), incorporate locally sourced marine ingredients like kelp, sea salt and micronized algae to purify and detoxify the body.\nThalassotherapy aside, there's also an infrared sauna, a 65-foot-long swimming pool and a juice bar that serves up organic, antioxidant-packed juices all day long.\nSpa at Ritz-Carlton, Bali (Bali, Indonesia)\nThough it's just six months old, the \nspa at the Ritz-Carlton Bali\n is already proving to be as impressively luxurious as the hotel itself.\nDecked out in suar wood and glossy marble, the spa features a state-of-the-art hydromassage pool comprising of five sections that target different areas of the body.\nThere are also two Jacuzzis, cold plunge pools, steam and sauna rooms, and a yoga studio overlooking the Indian Ocean.\nIn addition to 14 free-standing treatment rooms, there are four private spa villas outfitted with their own Balinese bathing pools and open-air lounges.\nTreatments blend ancient Balinese methods and modern techniques, and incorporate locally harvested ingredients like coconuts, seaweed and pearls, which are said to have nourishing antioxidant properties.\nShiseido Spa at Excelsior Hotel Gallia (Milan, Italy)\nSprawled across the sixth and seventh floors of the plush new \nExcelsior Hotel Gallia, Milan's\n newest spa -- opened late last year -- is also the largest in the city, clocking in at just under 11,000 square feet.\nIt has an indoor swimming pool with hydromassage and waterfalls, a Turkish hammam, an ice room and even a salt chamber, with walls made from sea salt imported from the Himalayas (said to promote better breathing).\nBut guests are really here for the high-tech treatments: The spa uses a cutting-edge Japanese formulation called Skingenecell 1P, said to be the first ingredient in the world to repel the fundamental cause of skin damage and aging.\nAfter something a little more low-key? \nThe spa's Zen Bathing Ceremony ($285), a two-hour-long, mineral-rich soak, is a perfect pick-me-up.\nThai House at Zemi Beach House Resort and Spa (Shoal Bay, Anguilla)\nThis isn't just any thatched-roof island spa: the newly opened \nThai House\n is a full-fledged wellness center on the shores of Shoal Bay.\nHere can be found the island's only hammam, a meditation garden, mud deck, yoga studio, hydrotherapy showers and vitality pool set to guests' body temperature. \nThere's even a juice bar.\nIts treatment rooms, built inside a traditional, 300-year-old Thai House (hence the name), have their own private relaxation lounges with ocean or garden views.\nTreatments are inspired by the wellness rituals of the local Taino people and use the healing benefits of local herbs, flowers, mud and sea salt. \nThe signature Zemi Sun Ritual ($305), for example, uses salt, papaya and macadamia nuts to exfoliate skin, followed by an oil treatment infused with local frangipani and jasmine oils.\nBaglioni SPA at Baglioni Hotel London (London)\nLocated in the bustling heart of London opposite Kensington Park, \nthis sleek newcomer\n feels like an oasis hidden in plain sight.\nLaunched in 2015 after a total makeover, the spa is ultramodern yet earthy, with nature-inspired artwork, warm colors and dark wood decor throughout.\nWith just five treatment rooms and a menu of only 14 treatments, the cozy spa focuses on quality over quantity.\nAs a result, treatments are as indulgent and luxurious as possible, from circulation-boosting 24-carat gold masks ($200), to diamond nectar-infused facials ($180) said to reduce hyperpigmentation and brighten skin.\nThere's even a rare facial made just for gents ($120) which uses green tea and mushroom extracts to detoxify and reduce pore size.\nSpa at Bernardus Lodge (Carmel Valley, California)\nThe views from the newly relaunched spa at \nBernardus Lodge\n are worth the visit alone.\nSituated in the heart of Monterey wine country, it's flanked by 28 acres of sun-drenched vineyards, orchards and oak forests.\nIt has all the features of a five-star spa: a sprawling pool, an outdoor Jacuzzi, a eucalyptus steam room, Vichy showers, a dry sauna and a state-of-the-art, 24-hour fitness center.\nBut it's the spa's strict \"garden-to-treatment\" philosophy -- which sources ingredients used in treatments from the lodge's own organic garden -- that makes it truly stand out.\nEverything from facials to pedicures are infused with homegrown lavender, mint, rosemary and Chardonnay grapes from the lodge's own vineyards. \nGuests can even soak in a Chardonnay-infused bubble bath.\nSpa at Reverie Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)\nOpened last September, \nthis two-level, 13,000-square-foot space\n is more like a full-fledged wellness center than a hotel spa.\nWith two open-air Jacuzzis, an 80-foot-long (almost Olympic-sized) swimming pool, several thermal areas and a 1,300-square-foot gym, it's the largest spa in the city.\nIt's also as unabashedly opulent as the hotel itself, decked out completely in Carrara marble, hand-laid mosaics and gold accents.\nTreatments are fittingly decadent, from mother-of-pearl scrubs ($90) to over-the-top couples' treatments featuring red wine body wraps and massages by candlelight, with champagne and caviar refreshments ($820).\nBohemia Spa at Four Seasons Hotel Prague (Prague)\nIn the heart of Old Town Prague, with sweeping vistas over the Vltava river, Charles Bridge and Prague Castle, Prague's \nnewest spa \nmight also be its loveliest.\nLocation aside, the space is architecturally striking -- set in a historic neoclassical building that shares the same elegant Baroque touches as the hotel itself.\nInside are mineral-rich thermal baths and an oxygen-intensified vitality pool said to have healing properties.\nTreatments are inspired by traditional Czech and Hungarian therapies and use local ingredients like linden oil, drawn from the blossoms of the Czech Republic's national tree.\nThough the new space won't officially open until the summer, a taste of its treatments can be found at the hotel's current spa, which continues to be fully operational.\nSpa at Six Senses Qing Cheng Mountain (Sichuan, China)\nSituated in the picturesque foothills of China's Qing Cheng Mountain -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- this \nbrand new spa\n's tranquil, river valley setting is as healing as the treatments themselves.\nHere, traditional Chinese therapies and Tao principles reign supreme, with little regard for modern, Western spa trends.\nInstead of high-tech treatments, there's acupuncture, cupping, which uses heated cups to promote circulation, and Gua Sha, which detoxifies and heals through repeated, pressurized strokes.  \nIn lieu of stem cell-infused creams and diamond nectar serums, wraps and scrubs are formulated from simple but potent local ingredients like gingko, lotus, ginger and bamboo.\nThermes Marins at Hotel Hermitage Monte-Carlo (Monaco)\nThermes Marins\n, which underwent a multimillion dollar makeover and relaunched last year, is exactly the kind of spa you'd expect to see in Monaco.\nThe ultramodern, four-level space overlooks Monte Carlo Harbor and boasts its own hammam, an ocean-facing saltwater pool, a state-of-the-art gym and a full-service beauty salon.\nIt's also home to the only spa in Europe with a cryotherapy complex, which consists of two cold chambers set at -60 C and -110 C.

A stain on the sheets? Poof: The fantasy is gone.\n\"The second it's not clean, an alarm goes off in your head that really ruins, in my opinion, the rest of your vacation,\" he explains.\nCleanliness really is next to godliness in the hotel business.\nUnresponsive, irresponsible front desk staff\nConsider the front desk staff your parents, Melchiorri says. \nIf anyone makes a mistake, it's the front desk's job \"to be the person that makes everything OK, gives you a Band-Aid, gives you a lollypop.\"\nBad things happen when your parents act up or ignore you. \nSome front desk agents have given out guest room keys to complete strangers. \nOn the flip side, Melchiorri recently needed a plastic fork for a meal in his room and it was there in about 35 seconds. \nThat's the front desk living up to its potential.\nMicro or invisible managers\nTrying to manage a hotel from afar is a losing proposition. \n\"There are businesses that can be absentee-operated such as a Laundromat or a car wash. Hotels simply aren't built that way,\" he says. \nHospitality is about people working together to create a great experience.\n\"If the owner and the housekeeper don't know the mission statement, then you don't have a functioning team,\" Melchiorri says.\nMicro-management can be a big problem too.\nMicro-managers may deliver a great guest experience, but they don't trust their own staff, so they'll probably run through personnel quickly, he explains.\n\"You have to trust. At some point you've got to take the training wheels off the bike.\"\nYears ago, Melchiorri let his housekeepers go home as soon as they cleaned their assigned number of rooms, with regular inspections to make sure the rooms were looking their best.\n\"Trusting but verifying is not micro-management,\" he says.\nOutdated or non-existent amenities\nTrue story: A hotel owner Melchiorri has been working with is using a paper plate wrapped in foil to improve her Wi-Fi service.\nThat's a hotel fail and an example of one that has \"milked out\" its profits and is left with no money to reinvest in improvements.\nOwners have to put a percentage of their profits back into the hotel, Melchiorri says.\nHe's been working at a California hotel that's charging way more than its competitors, but doesn't have a pool. \nIn an area where the climate and the competition make a pool essential, that's an automatic loss of business.\nStill, being pool-less is not the end of the world, Melchiorri says, but hoteliers have to make up for it by working especially hard to create great experiences to attract return guests.\n\"Be nice to them, treat them like family,\" he says.\nSkimpy essentials\nThere are pools and then there are bath towels. Bath towels are a must.\n\"It's fine to trim expenses, but some cut out investments in new linen, or having that extra person on in busy times, or other decisions that affect quality on a negative basis,\" explains Melchiorri.\nLosing a guest isn't worth the savings.\n\"If you're not changing the grout, if you're not giving good toiletries, if the room doesn't smell good, (guests) are skeeved out.\"\nReview blindness\nIgnoring reviews is essentially ignoring your guests.\nAnd risking your business.\n\"When owners say, 'well they're not important, people lie about them,' I guarantee you, everybody, you're all going out of business.\"\nMost hoteliers have a sense of when consumers are being overly dramatic, but Melchiorri believes that 99 percent of all reviews are accurate.\nResolving complaints is key.\nOnce Melchiorri's staff accidentally threw away a 13-year-old guest's playbill which had been signed by the entire cast of a Broadway show. \nThe concierge went to the theater and had the cast sign a new playbill and sent it to the guest. \nTouched by the gesture, the teen's mother voluntarily removed her eviscerating online review and thanked the hotel profusely. Problem solved.\nSlow reaction time \nSome consumers are easy. They lead with, \"if you have a moment\" and \"I'd appreciate it if ...\"\nThere's certainly nothing wrong with that approach, but those guests don't always get what they want in a timely manner. \nMelchiorri does. He's demanding \"in a very nice, direct way,\" and hotel workers are responsive to his sense of urgency. \nAnd that reaction is important to building guests' confidence to do whatever it is that brought them to the hotel, whether it's a business meeting or a funeral. \nReacting quickly is just as important as being nice.\nBut be nice, too.", "#CNNFood challenge: What do you have in your lunch box?": "Last night's leftovers?\nSomething you bulk-bought at the beginning of the week?\nFood you freshly prepared this morning?\nYour lunch is what keeps you going through your working day. \nIn Britain you might pack a plastic box with sandwiches, a packet of potato chips and fruit.\nIn Japan, it could be white rice, meat or fish with pickled vegetables in a bento box.\nIn the Philippines perhaps a baon containing pork adobo and rice.\nLunchtime is a perfect way to break up the working day and provides the fuels to see us through the afternoon.\nFor our latest #CNNFood challenge we want to know what you bring with you to work. \nJoin the #CNNFood challenge and share your lunchbox pictures and videos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. \nTag them \n#CNNFood\n and make sure you tell us where in the world you're enjoying your packed lunch. \nSo get packing and snapping this lunch hour!\nMore from Culinary Journeys", "Couple parodies Instagram-perfect 'Follow Me To' series": "In one photo, an impeccably dressed lady with gorgeous hair and a toned, sun-kissed back holds your hand, leading you into the lush hills of the Philippines. \nIn the next, she's guiding you to a stunning turquoise pool in Morocco.\nSuch is the narrative of Moscow-based photographer Murad Osmann's \"Follow Me To\" Instagram account, which feeds its 4.1 million followers with images of the same pose shot against beautiful backdrops all over the world.\nMORE: Beautiful scenes from Japan's most underrated region\nAnd now, it's fodder for parody.\nForrest Lu, a 36-year-old interior designer from Taiwan, found himself with thousands of fans this week after photos of him gripped by the hair as he's dragged unceremoniously by his wife, Agnes Chien, went viral.\nIn another photo in the \nFacebook album\n, called \"Honeymoon Hawaii,\" he's being pulled along by his nostrils.\n\"I wanted to take a picture of us holding hands like the 'Follow Me To' ones, but my wife (a mechanical procurement engineer) didn't want our pictures to look like other people's,\" Lu told CNN.\n\"So I said she could grab anything but my hand, and she just went for my hair and we took our first picture.\"\nTheir honeymoon snaps have since gathered thousands of Facebook \"likes\" and appeared on various Chinese-language lifestyle and news sites. \nMORE: Journey to Ni'ihau, Hawaii's 'forbidden island' of diving\nThe originators\nThe photos are a comical antidote to Osmann's perfectly staged snaps.  \nOsmann co-founded the original \"Follow Me To\" series with his then girlfriend/now wife Nataly Osmann, the subject of his viral photos.\nThey've since inspired many others to recreate their own romantic moments under the #FollowMeTo hashtag.\nThe project began accidentally, in 2011, during a holiday in Barcelona when Nataly got frustrated with Murad, who was preoccupied with taking pictures of the city.\nSo they're normal, after all.  ", "What does Cuba look like today?": "", "National parks: Roots of 'America's best idea'": "It was a practical solution to a territorial argument. It was supposed to become a state park, but the Yellowstone land was in three territories, none of them yet a state. \n\"There was an immediate argument between Montana and Wyoming newspapers about who would get the park,\" Yellowstone National Park historian Lee Whittlesey said. \"That is why Congress made it a federal park.\"\nMost members of Congress didn't oppose the Yellowstone legislation because most people hadn't seen the land, Whittlesey said. \n\"There was no railroad yet and no way to get there. It was incredibly difficult to reach the place,\" Whittlesey said.  \"The opposition basically asked, 'Can we farm it? Can we mine it? Oh, we can't? Then we can get rid of it later if we don't like it,' \" he said. \nThat's how \nYellowstone National Park \nbecame the world's first national park on March 1, 1872. \nThe creation of other national parks and monuments soon followed, culminating in the creation of the National Park Service on August 25, 1916.\nAs the National Park Service celebrates its 100th anniversary this year\n, it now cares for 409 park sites spread over more than 84 million acres (131,250-plus square miles) in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.  \nThese areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military and historical parks, historic sites, scenic rivers, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, trails and even the White House.\nVisitors are flocking to the parks in record numbers, with more than 305 million visits during 2015, a 12 million visit increase over 2014, according to initial estimates. \nNature as raw material\nIt wasn't always about preservation.\nIn the early days of the Republic, those beautiful natural resources were seen as raw materials by white explorers and settlers hoping to get rich. Conserving and preserving land for the benefit of the public good and future generations wasn't on a young government's agenda.\nAs people built cities, the idea of nature as spiritual refuge and antidote to bustling urban life began to emerge, thanks to the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Sierra Club founder John Muir. \n\"Come to the woods, for here is rest,\" wrote Muir, who worked and lived in Yosemite for part of his life. \n\"There is no repose like that of the green deep woods. Here grow the wallflower and the violet. The squirrel will come and sit upon your knee, the logcock will wake you in the morning. Sleep in forgetfulness of all ill. Of all the upness accessible to mortals, there is no upness comparable to the mountains.\"\nIt didn't matter that people couldn't actually get to Yosemite or Yellowstone. Nor was there much concern that there were Native Americans living on the land. \nThe stunning beauty of these natural wonders was evident in the paintings by Fredrick Edwin Church, Thomas Cole and others, which were shared in the popular magazines and newspapers of the day. \n\"They popularized the idea\n \nof the beauty of America, as Western exploration continued, and we encountered these places out West, including the geysers of Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon,\" said John Nagle, an environmental law professor at the University of Notre Dame. \nEurope had its castles and culture\nIt was artist George Caitlin, who captured the American West in his paintings of Native Americans, who first suggested the idea of \"a nation's park\" to protect Native American civilization, wilderness and wildlife from destruction in 1832, according to \"The National Parks: Shaping the System.\"\nThough Caitlin's concerns about Native American life were ignored, his suggestion to protect nature grew in popularity. \nSome of that push came from a national insecurity. Europe had its castles and grand culture, a point of self-doubt for a young nation. The United States had mountains, enormous waterfalls, great sequoias and geysers beyond compare.\n\"Europe had millennia of cultural superiority which we couldn't compete with, but we could with nature,\" said Nagle.  There was also the sense that \"public lands are not just for settlement and development. There are some we want to conserve to preserve for the natural features that are there.\"\nAnd the exploitation of Niagara Falls was proving that private enterprise could not be trusted to protect it. \nAlthough the U.S. side of the falls was a state park, the newspapers of the time reported that the commercialization of the park had become an embarrassment, Whittlesey said. The falls area was filled with concessionaires milking the natural beauty -- and visitors -- for everything they could. Europeans mocked the tourist spot. \nA move to protect natural wonders\nThe first time a federal government moved to protect nature was with the Yosemite Land Grant of 1864, when President Abraham Lincoln and Congress set aside parts of \nYosemite during the throes of the Civil War\n. \nThe land was given to the state of California and later became part of what would become the nation's fifth official national park.\n\"Lincoln was in the middle of the Civil War -- he had other things on his mind -- but he said, 'this is important,' \" said Beth Pratt, head of the National Wildlife Federation's California office. \nNext up: Yellowstone. \nPhotos and paintings from Ferdinand Hayden's 1871 expedition to Yellowstone, which included photographer William Henry Jackson and painter Thomas Moran, convinced government officials and the public of the need to protect this national treasure. \nThose images paved the way for Yellowstone to become the first national park in 1872. \nThere was no money allocated to Yellowstone to hire staff or protect the land, although the need didn't really arise until the Northern Pacific Railroad's tracks to the north entrance of the park were completed around 1883. \nMore national parks and monuments followed: Mackinac National Park, now a Michigan state park (1875); Casa Grande Ruin Reservation in Arizona, now a national monument (1889); Sequoia National Park in California, now administered jointly with Kings Canyon (1890); General Grant National Park, now Kings Canyon (1890); Yosemite National Park (1890); and more. \nCongress made it even easier for future presidents to protect natural resources through the passage of the Antiquities Act of 1906, and President Teddy Roosevelt -- a Muir ally -- proceeded to add to the country's protected list of natural resources. \nYet it was probably Muir's great failure at Yosemite that pushed through the creation of the National Park Service.\nFor 12 years starting in 1901, Muir led a Sierra Club campaign at Yosemite National Park to stop the \nHetch Hetchy Valley \nfrom being filled by a reservoir. Congress ignored the opposition in 1913 and passed legislation allowing the city of San Francisco to build a dam and reservoir that flooded the valley to supply its water needs. \nThe threats to protected national parks became clear in the aftermath of Hetch Hetchy (which still supplies water to the Bay Area). The American Civic Association, the National Geographic Society and others supported the campaign to create a single agency to oversee and protect the parks.\n \nOne powerful ally was wealthy Chicago businessman Stephen Mather, who complained about mismanagement of the national parks to Interior Secretary Franklin Lane. Lane challenged Mather to join the department and do something about it, which Mather agreed to do. \nOn August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Organic Act creating the National Park Service, which became responsible for protecting the existing 14 national parks, 21 monuments, two reservations and those yet to be established.  \nMuir, nicknamed the father of the National Park Service, never got the chance to celebrate his victory. He died in 1914 at age 76. \nThe National Park Service was directed to \"conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations,\" said Mather, who became its first director in 1917 and served until 1929. \nMather set the tone for a public good that would be shared by everyone who visited the national parks. \n\"The parks do not belong to one state or to one section,\" Mather said. \"The Yosemite, the Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon are national properties in which every citizen has a vested interest; they belong as much to the man of Massachusetts, of Michigan, of Florida, as they do to the people of California, of Wyoming, and of Arizona.\" \n\"A visit inspires love of country; begets contentment; engenders pride of possession; contains the antidote for national restlessness. ...

We become the first vessel of the year to circumnavigate Spitsbergen, the largest island in Norwegian Arctic territory, due to receding ice allowing passageway. \nBehind this celebration are warning bells. \nAs one of the most fragile environments in the world, global climate change discussion pivots on the Arctic, with world leaders steering its fate. \nIn 2015, the United States granted permission to petrochemical giant Shell to drill the Arctic seabed for oil.\nAlthough drilling was abandoned due to high costs and lack of findings, the company is seeking to extend exploration leases that currently expire in 2017.\nWith oil prices in constant flux and demand steadily rising, it could only be a matter of time before the Arctic is viewed as a viable target. \nIn 2015, the multi-year ice has receded far north, allowing us to press deeper into the Arctic than expected. \nIt's \"an indisputable aspect of human-driven climate change,\" declares Jamie Watts, ship leader and marine life enthusiast. \nRecord ice melts\nMulti-year ice nourishes the entire Arctic food web. Its decline, said to be a result of greenhouse gas emissions, has drawn polar bears farther from their dens onto thin broken ice -- feeble hunting ground. \nIncreasing global carbon emissions and greenhouse gases are said to be propelling a colossal decline in multi-year ice. \nIn 2015, Arctic ice cover fell to the fourth lowest extent in the satellite record, with temperatures hitting the second highest recorded, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). \n\"Ten years ago this would have been an astonishing summer of ice melt,\" says Ted Scambos, NSIDC's lead scientist. \"Now it is just another season in a decade of low years.\" \nClimate models predict Arctic summer ice will eventually disappear. \nThe survival of marine life is entirely reliant on the shelter, nutrient-density and protection of multi-year sea ice.\n\"The almost complete melt-away of the multi-year ice in recent summers has really knocked the core productivity of the whole ecosystem,\" Watts warns. \nFor would-be adventurers to these reaches it means intensified scouring for polar bears and Arctic wildlife -- and coordinated round-the-clock watch duties for our guides.\nUncharted waters\nAfter passing over the crest of Spitsbergen, we navigate the colder, icier eastern front. Here, serene fjords give way to ice-encrusted mountains, as gigantic glaciers tumble into the frozen glassy sea.  \nFrom the ship, I'm bundled onto a small inflatable raft to get up close. Traversing uncharted icy waters, the stillness is staggering. \nEngine off, we drift between surging blue icebergs the size of houses and glide up to centuries-layered glaciers the size of cities. Our tiny boat feels insignificant in this hyper-frozen other-world. \nThe midnight sun casts a golden glow, hovering just above the horizon as it struggles to climb the earth's curvature at this latitude. \nIn a rare stream of sunlight, crystalline glaciers and translucent icicles glisten like diamonds, as we float silently past. \nSurrounding mountains reveal silvered flashes of spirited Arctic foxes, awaiting the failed first flight of fledgling guillemots. Nearby, kittiwakes flood towering limestone cliffs that resemble something out of \"Jurassic Park.\"\nAnd the elusive polar bear makes an appearance. \nA herd of blubbery and pungent walruses lines one side of beach while, opposite, a lone plump bear navigates ice and mossy mountainside.\nHe's a striking animal, thick cream fur contrasting against dark shale and the frosted backdrop.\nThe bear is guided by a superior sense of smell, as he visibly follows his nose towards his prey, which he can smell more than a kilometer away. \nArctic lifeline\nAs the largest mammals in the world to actively hunt humans as food, proximity to bears involves firearm-trained guides. \nWe watch from small boats, a distance from the shoreline. \nA steady decline in bear sizes and birth weights has been linked to Arctic warming. \nIt's unavoidable, explains Susan Adie, wildlife activist and G Adventures operations manager.\n\"We are going to see more scrawny bears in the long term, directly linked to a loss of sea ice,\" she says.\nThe ice is a lifeline for Arctic wildlife. \nPolar bears are the star attraction but can quickly become sidelined. \nWhile observing a mother and bear cub nuzzling on land, our attention is diverted by a shoal of white beluga whales silently somersaulting past our boats, gray babies in tow.\nThese dynamic masters of the Arctic Ocean rely on peaceful and remote Arctic seas to communicate. \nNoise and pollution from Arctic drilling and submarine explosions (for oil exploration) could exact a devastating marine toll, Adie explains. \n\"Agreeing to Arctic drilling is a bad decision and a mistake. The problems are so huge and complicated.\"\nShe adds, \"Bowhead whales have carved an evolutionary pathway for migration and feeding. Drilling would force them to attempt new dangerous routes.\"\nBrink of meltdown\n\"If the young are endangered, the species becomes threatened. This is just one example.\"\nThreats of potential oil spill could be fatal for the fragile Arctic environment, already teetering on the brink of meltdown. \nFor my fellow passengers, including travelers from Brazil and China, visiting the Arctic demands responsibility. \nLandings are punctuated by lectures from chief field researchers. \nThey're united in the belief that welcoming and educating visitors to the region will help preserve its future.\nWatts sums it up. \"You have to see it, to feel it with your own senses.  We only want those who are engaged enough to genuinely do something about looking after it.\"\nFor now, a major environmental battle has been won, with one oil giant abandoning operations, but with future prospecting still on the table the war over the Arctic is far from over.\nThe possibility that future generations may not witness centuries-aged ice, the wildlife it sustains, and the serenity of the hyper-frozen scene would be a great tragedy of our time.

JetBlue finished second, followed by No. 3-ranked Delta Air Lines.\nBut things are not so rosy for many airline passengers. Despite overall industry improvement in three of the four categories tracked, customer complaints rose by 38% from 2014 to 2015.\n\"This is the worst complaints have been for 15 years, as a rate. The last time it got this high was in 2001,\" said report co-author Dean Headley, a researcher at Wichita State University's business school.\nWhy the dissatisfaction?\nHeadley suspects that passengers are annoyed by ticket change fees of up to $200 and a lack of improvement in airline amenities, despite the fact that four of the nation's\n top airlines saved more than $11 billion in fuel costs\n in the first nine months of 2015.\n\"There's $11 billion that they just walked into, so to speak. \n\"And have they done anything to help the consumer experience?

all with their own reasons for trying the Amazonian brew.\n\"I'm a psychotherapist,\" says Angela, 41, from Liverpool. \"I've always been interested in professional development and keeping myself clean for clients.\"\nShe's already taken ayahuasca 12 times, mostly in the Peruvian jungle. \n\"Through it I've become a lot more relaxed in myself and more present,\" she says.\nMany of the participants are here on a spiritual quest to \"expand their consciousness.\" \nBut a few have come with more immediate, health-related goals.\n'Facing demons'\nDean, 32, who works in property in Manchester, England, says he's been addicted to ketamine since his mid-20s, resulting in health problems.\n\"I was scared before I came here,\" he says. \"I've never done it before, although I shouldn't be because I've taken plenty of drugs in the past and this is a controlled environment. \n\"But you see a lot of people coming face to face with their demons, and maybe because of that, I was afraid of what I was going to see.\"\nOn the opposite side of the room is Fabienne, 51, a French citizen now living in England who hopes ayahuasca will ease the multiple sclerosis she was diagnosed with 12 years ago.\n\"I believe that somehow, unconsciously, I created my symptoms and by unraveling my experiences and going into a deeper understanding it might free my physical body,\" she says.\nFabienne describes her experience so far at the retreat as \"surprising, shocking, sacred, beautiful, difficult and ongoing ... It [ayahuasca] gives me hope as a human being.\"\nTonight's session is being facilitated by Ramon, a Mexican economics graduate who quit his well-paid bank job after taking ayahuasca for the first time just over a year ago.\n\"I felt empty and I went on an Ayahuasca International retreat as a participant and afterward I said I wanted to become part of the team,\" he says.\nMORE: 10 calming wellness retreats\nHopes and fears\nAfter going to the jungle with Ayahuasca International founder Alberto Varela, Ramon resigned from his job, moved to Spain and took part in a six-month course to become an ayahuasca facilitator. \nTonight is the first time he'll lead a session unassisted by others.\nUnaware of his lack of experience, the participants put their hopes and fears in Ramon's hands.\nThe session starts with the ingestion of a powdered tobacco blown into the nasal cavities with the purpose of bringing calm to the mind.\nAfter some initial coughing and spluttering, the intense sensations begin to ease and the moment approaches for taking the first dose of ayahuasca.\nOne by one the participants nervously approach Ramon who fills a small shot glass with the bitter, treacly substance, which most down in one large gulp.\nWith the ayahuasca administered and everyone resuming their position on their mattresses, it's a waiting game until the plant mixture begins to take effect.\nFor many, the first sign that something is happening is the visual appearance of brightly colored geometric patterns (a hallucination), often accompanied by feelings of nausea.\nSome relive traumatic moments from their childhoods, finding peace, acceptance and forgiveness, while others receive insights on the nature of reality.  \nMORE: Sweating it out in a Mayan Temazcal steam bath\nRetching and vomiting\nThroughout the five or six hours the ayahuasca session lasts, there's a cacophony of noises ranging from retching and vomiting, through to sobbing and hysterical laughter.\nAnd then as suddenly as it began, Ramon announces that the session has ended, leaving many of the participants to sleep off their experience on their mattresses while others head back to their rooms.\nIt's clear that Ayahuasca International's growing presence worldwide represents a heightened interest in trying the Amazonian brew, despite its ambiguous legal status.\nFabienne offers her own conclusions. \n\"More and more people are searching for greater meaning in their lives and I think people are bored of consumerism and want experiences that enhance their growth,\" she says. \"That's why it's becoming more popular and needed.\"\nAlthough only partway through the retreat, most of the participants have found the experience worthwhile.\n\"I'd definitely recommend it,\" says Fabienne. \"But you have to take responsibility to realize that it's serious. It's not the '80s or '90s trip; it's to be used much more as a growth experience.\n\"I've gone from absolute dread of ayahuasca to starting to having a relationship with it and trusting myself in that experience and that whatever arises is OK.\"\nSome names have been changed at the request of the interviewees.", "Delicious pain at New York's hottest Sichuan restaurant": "His tongue-numbing, eye-watering Sichuan cuisine is not \"challenging for the sake of being challenging,\" Bowien said. There's no wall of fame for daring to dine.\nBut dishes such as the chile-heaped Chongqing Chicken Wings have a grip on consumers, inspiring hours-long waits at Bowien's \nMission Chinese Food\n in New York.\n\"When I brought my good friend Eric Ripert here, he took one bite of these chicken wings and ran for the bathroom in a state of real alarm,\" Bowien fan Anthony Bourdain said as a warning to Anderson Cooper.\n\"But he did call me the next day, first thing in the morning, and say, 'You know those chicken wings? I've been thinking about them. We have to go back.' \"\nNot everyone is such a fan of the eclectic eatery Bourdain calls \"the most fun restaurant in New York.\"\n\"We're a very controversial restaurant,\" Bowien said. \"Some people love us.

He was 19 when he had his first authentic Korean food. \nIn his mid-20s, post culinary-school, he discovered Sichuan Chinese cuisine when he was working at fine-dining restaurants in San Francisco.\nHe and his friends gravitated toward food on the other end of the spectrum from what they made at work, and Sichuan food presented a fresh challenge for Bowien.\nAs a chef, he could frequently decode how things were made.\n\"But when I would go eat Sichuan food, it was the first time in a long time that I'd gone somewhere and been like, 'I have no idea what I'm tasting, how I'm tasting it, what these flavors are and how to actually do some of these things,' \" he said.\nSo he learned. \nHe started cooking Sichuan cuisine at a San Francisco pop-up eatery inside a Chinese restaurant, and Mission Chinese Food was born. \nIn 2013, he won a James Beard Award for Rising Star Chef of the Year.\nNow, at 33, Bowien has three restaurants: Mission Chinese Food restaurants in New York and San Francisco and New York's Mission Cantina, which serves both Mexican and Chinese food.\nUnformed ambition\nBowien seems to be loving it and gaining confidence as he goes. \nHe's bounced back from a humbling closure of Mission Chinese in New York for health violations shortly after it opened.\nHe plays in a band, as the drummer for Narx. And he's a husband and father who finds time to SoulCycle.\nBowien appears surprised by his trajectory. \nBefore he headed to culinary school, largely for the opportunity to live in San Francisco, he worked in an optometrist's office and played music. \nBut Bowien used to tell his mom, who died when he was a teenager, that he'd open a restaurant.\n\"You're like, 'Oh, one day I'll do this or one day I'll do that. I'm going to be an astronaut,' \" he said.\n\"I'm sure there's a few astronauts out there that said that when they were younger and they're there now like, 'Yeah, I didn't really think this was going to happen, but it did.' \"", "World's 25 most popular amusement parks": "The world's most famous mouse house has topped the list of the world's 25 most popular theme and amusement parks. \nThe Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida welcomed more than 20.4 million visitors in 2015, a 6% increase of over 2014, according to a report released Wednesday.\nAmusement park attendance is increasing around the world.\nThere were 235.6 million visits to the top 25 theme and amusement parks worldwide, up 5.4% from 2014, \naccording to the Themed Entertainment Association/AECOM 10th annual global attractions attendance report. \nThe index ranks the 25 most-visited amusement and theme parks around the world, based on attendance figures compiled by AECOM, a global consulting firm.\n\"The growth we've seen this year is tremendous for a relatively mature industry,\" said John Robinett, senior vice president, economics, AECOM, in a statement. \n\"Over our 10 years of tracking the industry, we have seen steady improvements in business volume (despite a global recession) the introduction of exciting new technologies and continued internationalization of the attractions world.\"\nTop 10 U.S. beaches for 2016\nDisney dominated the list.\nDisney parks in the United States, Europe and Asia held seven of the top 10 parks and 10 of the top 25 spots. \nUniversal Studios two parks in the top 10 list and three in the top 25 list, while SeaWorld had just one. \nVisits to parks are increasing all around the world.  \nThe top 20 North American theme/amusement parks reported 146 million visits last year, up 5.9% from 2014. \nThe top 20 Asian theme/amusement parks reported 131 million visits last year, up 6.9% from 2014. \nThere were 61 million visits to parks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa last year, up 2.8% from 2014.\nHere are the top 25 most popular amusement and theme parks around the world. \n1.

As such, sanatoriums were seen as showpieces that could display Soviet superiority to attitudes in the west, where holidays were a time to engage in pleasurable activities with a focus on material rather than spiritual gain.\nRead: Eritrea's playground of futurist architecture\nThis gave architects the green light to be as bold and ostentatious as they desired, regardless of cost.

", "Wanna see northern lights? Here's how": "And watching the ever-shifting lights flicker in the sky above mountains, glaciers and vast lava fields is particularly breathtaking. \nIn Iceland, the aurora borealis attracts everyone from professional photographers to travelers that have the phenomenon on their list of things to do before they kick it.\nYou'll have the best chance of seeing the night lights when it's cold and dark outside and the aurora activity is high. \nThe cold isn't a factor but the sky has to be clear, which it usually is on extremely cold nights. \nThe phenomenon is caused by solar winds, which push electronic particles to collide with molecules of atmospheric gases that cause an emission of bright light. \nThe best time to see the northern lights in Iceland is from October to March.\nThere are forecasts predicting visibility at \nvedur.is\n, the national weather website. \nWhen the forecast is strong, it's best to drive (or take a tour bus) to a dark area and look up. \nBelow are some of the best spots on the island to see the northern lights.\nSouth: City lights\nStaying in Reykjavik, Iceland's capital and the only city, with no access to a car?\nThat's OK. \nThe northern lights can be seen by taking a walk down to the Grotta lighthouse, where light pollution is at a minimum. \nOther spots that might be dark enough are near the dome-shaped building Perlan (The Pearl), close to Oskjuhlid, or at Hljomskalagardur Park. \nFor a short car ride, it's worth considering Thingvellir National Park, site of Iceland's first parliament, which is isolated and pitch black at night. \nFor visitors uncomfortable with traveling alone there are tours available.\nReykjavik Excursions\n offers northern lights tours -- buses depart regularly from downtown Reykjavik.\nWest: Beautiful backdrops\nLonely Planet recently named West Iceland one of its \ntop picks\n for 2016.\nFor good reason -- it has everything: glaciers, mountains, lava fields, ice caves. \nWhen hunting for northern lights in the west, the Snaefellsnes peninsula and fishing villages like Akranes and Borgarnes are worth seeking out. \nThere are many interesting backdrops for northern lights photos here, including the Snaefellsjokull glacier, black beaches and miles of interesting rock formations. \nLighthouses are favored by photographers as great spots to capture the aurora borealis, and Akranes lighthouse -- just 40 minutes from Reykjavik -- is one of the best. \nThe lights streak and dance over the sea with minimal light pollution. \nArctic Adventures\n offers tours in the west, including a northern lights tour by super jeep.\nNorth: Dramatic landscapes\nNorthern Iceland is home to some of the most dramatic landscapes on the island -- including thundering waterfalls and geothermal hot spots. \nThe unofficial capital of the north, and Iceland's second most populous town, Akureyri is at the center of it all. \nThe town has a thriving art scene, snow sports, chic shops and good restaurants. \nThe open terrain with a small population and low light pollution makes it an ideal destination to catch a glimpse of the aurora. \nExtreme Iceland \noffers a two- to three-hour northern lights tour during the winter. \nOther good locations for independent travelers include the mighty Dettifoss waterfall and the lush Lake Myvatn.\nEast: Isolation and sheep\nFor anyone seeking isolation, the east is the least populous region of Iceland. \nIn fact, it's more common to encounter sheep than humans. \nThe east is home to the actual \"ice\" of Iceland, as Vatnajokull glacier looms over farms and vast expanses of desolate land. \nJokulsarlon, the glacier lagoon, is by far the best place to see the lights in the east. \nThe lagoon features huge blocks of ice that are endlessly breaking off the glacier, and large icebergs float along in the water. \nThe lagoon isn't wide but it is up to 250 meters deep, making it the deepest lake in Iceland. \nIcelandic Mountain Guides\n offers tours that include a Northern Lights hunt at Jokulsarlon. \nStand along the ice, bundle up in your warmest clothes, look up and enjoy the show.\nIt's worth keeping in mind that the weather is unpredictable in Iceland. \nIt's best to check the roads (\nroad.is\n) before heading out on a northern lights hunt, or any excursion.", "Man with muscular dystrophy to backpack in Europe as a 'backpack'": "That doctor was wrong. \nToday, not only is Chandler breathing freely, but the 29-year-old is about to undertake a rite of passage for many 20-somethings: backpacking around Europe. But there's a catch.\nChandler won't be doing it with a backpack; he plans to do it \nas\n a backpack of sorts. \nChandler, who weighs 65 pounds and moves with the help of a wheelchair, will be strapped to his friends'\n \nbacks using a customized pack as they tour France, England and Ireland.\nThe ingenuity of the backpack design came from a spur-of-the-moment decision to join his friends in an area that was not wheelchair accessible: the sewers of Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\"We threw the pack together in like an hour. It was a hiking backpack with a metal frame. We actually laid it on the ground, and they laid me on top of it, using hammocks,\" Chandler said. \nIt worked, and the pack sparked a new-found confidence in this would-be traveler. \n\"If we can do this, what else can we do?\" he wondered. The answer was \"the world.\"\nThe dream\nChandler and his friends have set up a \nGoFundMe page\n to help finance their journey to Europe, which is scheduled to begin on June 19. \nThe budding fantasy writer's itinerary is heavily inspired by own ancestral roots and a nostalgia for his heroes. \nFirst up, Samois-sur-Seine, France, the former home of Django Reinhardt, a guitarist who invented a new style of jazz to accommodate his deformed hands, which were burned in a fire. \n\"I found out about Reinhardt in high school and that was about the time my hands were getting weaker as well. He flourished despite his disabilities,\" Chandler said. \nMORE: Disabled man's wheelchair odyssey across China\nChandler's condition is degenerative, affecting the skeletal muscles that control movement, and there is no known cure. But like his idol, Chandler remains defiant. \n\"My philosophy is just to keep moving,\" he said.\nMuch of his fortitude springs from his older sister, Connie, who was also born with muscular dystrophy. \n\"The doctors told my parents, 'if you have another kid, they will have it, and we encourage you not to.' My dad took mom's hand and told the doctors, 'if you're telling me the worst thing that can happen is we have another child like Connie, we're OK with that.'\"\n'Keep moving'\nAfter a jaunt through England, the group will face their biggest uphill climb -- literally. \nAtop the rocky island of Skellig Michael, off Ireland's coast, sits a preserved sixth-century monastery, a terminus that appeals to Chandler's deep sense of faith.\nBut getting to the top is a challenge for even the most able-bodied person. A 600-step staircase will sit between the group of friends and the monastery. \nChandler's friends are eager for the challenge and inspired by his ambitious wanderlust. \nMORE: Accomable: Could this Airbnb-style service revolutionize disability travel? \n\"I just renewed my gym membership ... but we're going to make it fun. His disability is just a layer of character; it's not the essence of his character,\" said Tom Troyer, who'll be carrying Chandler part of the way. \nEvery step of their voyage will be filmed, and Chandler hopes his story, which he plans to pen along the way, will inspire others who have been told they couldn't conquer the world because of their disabilities.\n\"Like I said, we just have to keep moving,\" he said.", "Wild video shows moment tourist clipped by plane": "Amateur photographer Mekki Jaidi was on vacation last Wednesday in the Caribbean island of St. Barthelemy when he decided to head to a \nplane-spotting\n area famous for its nerve-wrackingly low plane descents.   \nThat's when one small aircraft got a little too low and grazed him.\nA videographer who happened to be nearby testing out his 360-degree camera captured the scary moment when the plane swooped over Jaidi's ducked head, narrowly avoiding a full collision. \nMORE: World's most dramatic airport runways \nLeft with a black mark from the plane's wheels touching his trigger finger, Jaidi told CNN he \"felt something briefly but no pain at all.\" \nBecause he was looking through the viewfinder, he didn't realize just how low the plane was flying -- until the very last second. \nThe plane seemed to be struggling with the approach to the island's Gustaf III airport -- known as one of the most challenging in the world. It requires pilots to navigate a steep descent to land and departing planes take off mere meters above sunbathers on the beach. \nAfter the plane missed him, the pilot reportedly aborted his second landing attempt before finally succeeding on the third. \nMORE: The Caribbean's most breathtaking landing strips\nAlthough he's received some flack for being in danger's way, Jaidi said that he was on a public road where many people gather to photograph aircraft and the plane's path was abnormally low. \n\"People are forgetting the videographer person was doing the exact same thing as me,\" he said. \"I was literally a foot or two to the right of him while my wife was also a foot or two away. I wasn't doing anything wrong on a public road.\" \n\"Who would you put at fault for that particular location? The pilot or the people who have a right of way?\n\"You could tell me my life was in danger, but did I feel like it was? No. I wasn't hurt at all,\" he said.", "Airport security: Can attacks be prevented?": "Unlike the March \nterror attacks\n on the \nBrussels Airport\n and Maelbeek metro station, the reason for the disappearance of the EgyptAir flight while en route from Paris to Cairo is not yet known. \nThe jet had routine maintenance checks in Cairo before it left for Paris, the airline said. Earlier Wednesday, the jet had been in Eritrea and Tunisia, data from flight tracking websites show. \nThere had already been more police and military personnel at major international airports in Europe, the United States and around the world in response to the Brussels attacks, and travelers should still arrive earlier because of increased preflight security.  \nThat's a typical response after an attack, says aviation security expert Richard Bloom, but that's not the only way to halt future attacks. \nOpinion: U.S. needs airport security rethink \nDetecting threats well before they arrive at the airport is key.\n\"The United States and Israel have two of the best aviation security operations in the world,\" says Bloom, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's chief academic officer and director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies.\n\"They engage in intelligence gathering operations and identify people who are a threat way before they get anywhere near the airport,\" he says. \"The farther away you handle it, neutralizing the threat, the better off you are.\"\nAirport security isn't terribly complicated, says Bloom, who consults with airports about security. He advises clients that they need to collect and analyze data about possible threats, study their facility's vulnerabilities and figure out the risks to the airport.\nBased on that risk and available funds, government and airport officials can decide what to spend on human and technological security options.  \nDoes the Israeli model work?\nThe gold standard for airport security is Israel, which exists in conflict with many of its neighbors in the Middle East. Its airport screening process is especially rigorous, starting when travelers buy plane tickets to and from the country. \nIn addition to the intelligence-gathering and passenger scrutiny that travelers can't see, there's a security check on the road leading into Israel's largest airport, Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport.\nThere's another check before travelers enter the terminal, and then they go through the preflight security screening that's required in airports around the globe.\nAdopting similar measures in other parts of the world is a question of cost and scale.\nIn Israel, about 16.3 million passengers flew into and out of Ben Gurion last year, according to Airports Council International, the global trade representative of airports.\nIn contrast, the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris handled more than 65 million passengers last year, making it the ninth-busiest airport in the world, ACI figures show.\nOn an even larger scale, some 800 million revenue-paying passengers flew on U.S. carriers last year, according to U.S. government data.\nThe United States has 485 commercial service airports, says ACI, which represents more than half of them.\nThat's why bringing Israel's system to the United States would be cost-prohibitive, says aviation security consultant Jeff Price of Leading Edge Strategies. \n\"If we want to do (in the United States) what Israel does, the cost would be extraordinary,\" Price says. \"Budgets would be as least 10 times higher.\"\nAre there drawbacks to tighter security?\nFinancial hurdles aren't the only barriers to a more stringent airport security system.\nCritics have accused both Israel and the United States of racial profiling in aviation security procedures.  \nLast year, Israel's High Court of Justice refused to ban racial profiling in a case brought by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. The court did leave the door open for the group to file a case in the future.\nThe U.S. Transportation Security Administration, established after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, touts its evolution from a \"one-size-fits-all security screening approach to a risk-based, intelligence-driven strategy.\"\nYet that strategy, which includes a behavior detection and analysis program that the agency says is scientifically substantiated, has long been criticized by passengers, security analysts and civil liberties advocates as flawed and discriminatory. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union \nsued for records related to the program in 2015 to gauge its effectiveness.\nThat's in addition to the more recent complaints about hours-long TSA security lines at many U.S. airports\n, a combination of increased passenger volume and decreased front-line security personnel. \nIn Europe, each nation administers its own aviation security \nwith European Union member states and a handful of closely aligned countries operating under overarching rules established by the European Commission in 2002. \nImplementation of those standards varies, even within European countries, from airport to airport, says Price, declining to name specific airports. \nCan you even see tighter security?\nIn the meantime, experts predict tighter security measures at airports worldwide. \nOrdinary travelers likely won't notice most of them, such as increased intelligence-gathering, more explosives detection devices and random security screenings of flight crews and airport personnel.\nBrendan Koerner, a contributing editor at Wired and the author of \"\nThe Skies Belong to Us\n,\" which details the hijackings of the 1960s and 1970s that led to increased security at U.S. airports, expects \"a wholesale reconsideration of where the security curtain, so to speak, begins in airports.\"\n\"As of right now, of course, you can pull your car right up to the curb at any major airport, just feet away from the doors that lead to the ticketing areas,\" Koerner says. \nHe expects more barriers between the drop-off areas and main doors to reduce the chances of improvised explosive device attacks via vehicles. \nBut there's just no way to prevent all attacks, experts say. \n\"I'm not sure how much more we can ramp up security without seriously infringing on the freedoms that are so integral to our lives,\" Koerner says. \n\"An armed guard at every door throughout the world? That seems unworkable and, to be frank, precisely the sort of overreaction that the Islamic State wants to invite.\"\nAnd even that might not prove 100% effective. \n\"Even when you do everything right, bad things still can happen,\" Bloom says.

Kyrgyzstan was behind us.\nTo the south lay Afghanistan and the fabled Wakhan Corridor. \nWe were heading south, along the Pamir Highway, officially known as the M41.\nCelebrated as one of the planet's most intrepid road trips, this 2,038-kilometer-long road navigates through the sands of Central Asia into the heart of isolated ranges.\nFirst stop: Sary Moghul\nThe appeal of staying in local homestays and immersing in the Muslim culture is what brought us to this semi-paved, high-altitude trail, home to about 120,000 Pamiri minority people. \nSetting out from Osh, Kyrgyzstan, my fiance and I hired a 4x4 and a gregarious driver named Mohammed from the Osh Guesthouse.\nUnder the hotel owner's guidance we drew up a rough, seven-day itinerary that would lead us along the Pamir Highway and into the Wakhan Valley, on the Afghan border.\nWe began our drive through the plateaus outside Osh on a bright Saturday morning, bound for the village of Sary Moghul.\nNear the base of the 7,143-meter tall Peak Lenin, Sary Moghul is a charming town that attracts hikers and mountaineers from around the globe.\nThe town has just enough appeal to warrant a day's exploration. \nWe spent the afternoon wandering the dirt roads and playing a game of football with a group of young boys.\nEntering Central Asia's no-man's-land\nAfter a comfortable night in the bustling \nCommunity Based Tourism\n guesthouse, we set off for the 25-kilometer stretch of no-man's-land that separates Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\nAt the border Mohammed took care of the necessary \"paperwork\" to allow us to cross.\nApparently our official visas weren't enough.\nLater we asked Mohammed how much he had to pay the guards.\n\"Too much,\" he replied soberly.\nCraggy and desolate mountains converted the landscape as we continued to gain altitude.\nThe scenery would stay that way until we reached the lush Wakhan Valley.\nKarakul Lake appeared like a shimmering mirage on the horizon as we pulled into its waterside village for the evening.\nWe dropped our bags off at Sadat's Homestay and immediately set about exploring the concrete town. \nThe shell of a Soviet tank lay buried on the edge of an abandoned prison and soldiers played volleyball with the villagers.\nLife in Karakul is unhurried, and we took this relaxed atmosphere back with us to Sadat's as night fell.\nFor $12 a head, the family offered a bed and three delicious home-cooked meals.\nTraditional Pamiri houses are built with strong symbolism to their Ismaili faith, which is a secretive branch of Islam.\nThey have five supporting pillars, representing each member of their prophet Ali's family, and four square layers in the ceiling, expressive of the Zoroastrian elements of fire, air, water and earth.\nWe slept on blankets on a colorful, carpeted floor; a wood fire stove heated the room throughout the night.\nTravel restrictions\nWith the Taliban threat still present in Afghanistan, Tajikistan has placed travel restrictions on foreigners.\nThe Pamir Highway runs through the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) and special permits are required to travel in the region.\nThese are easily attained at Tajik embassies. We collected ours in one day in Bishkek. \nOur permits allowed passage through the various military checkpoints as we made our way from Karakul to the small town of Murghab, which sits inside the GBAO. \nWe spent the next few days hiking around the vast Bulunkul Lake, drinking tea with local shepherds and stocking up on supplies in Murghab's markets.\nWhere the M41 Pamir Highway veers inland to Khorog, we turned towards the border of Afghanistan, leaving the paved road and committing to two days of sand, dust and captivating scenes of the Hindu Kush.\nThe Panj River flowed into sight, carving out the valley and forming the official border between the two nations.\nWhere old empires collide\nThe Wakhan Corridor -- a narrow, finger-like stretch of Afghanistan high in the Hindu Kush mountains -- is the result of border divisions during the Great Game, a 19th century political battle between Russia and Britain.\nThe curious lines on a map are only one indication of the years of turmoil that have plagued this area.\nMore telling are the 2,200-year-old ruined fortresses that remain perched on the hillsides in Langar, Yamchun and Ishkashim -- important and fertile villages along the Panj River. \nToday they're spectacular sites to explore, offering commanding views over Afghanistan's snow-capped mountains and gorges.\nA Buddhist shrine,10,000-year-old petroglyphs and a fascinating museum in Yamg village broke up our road trip through the region, educating us on the diverse range of ethnic cultures that have inhabited the Wakhan.\nEvery village we drove through had kids running alongside the 4x4, waving and calling out \"hello\" in genuine excitement.\nEach host in our superb homestays asked us to encourage other travelers to visit.\nA heated conversation\nIn Yamchun, the Bibi Fatima hot springs attract locals and travelers alike, seeking to improve their fertility by soaking in the mineral waters.\nMen and women are separated, keeping with the modest customs of the Islamic faith.\nStripping completely, I stepped into the grotto-like bath and was greeted by three Tajik men. \nThey were talking in the local Pamiri language.\n\"As-Salaam-Alaikum,\" they addressed me. \nPeace be upon you.\n\"Wa-Alaikum-us-Salaam,\" I replied. \nAnd peace be upon you.\nThe men switched to broken English, asking me about my time in their country.\nMany Pamiris are learning English to work in the growing tourism industry. \n\"You and your friends are always welcome in Tajikistan,\" they said proudly, before leaving me in the hot springs.\n\"They can't wait to meet you\"\nThe twists and turns in the road continued as our final day led us to Khorog, and the end of our journey.\nMohammed bid farewell to us at the Pamir Lodge, hurriedly returning to Osh in the hope of picking up more customers before winter arrived.\nA handful of eager travelers were waiting in the lodge to start their own adventure, reversing the route we had just taken.\nWe traded tips and stories beneath a crisp and clear autumn evening.\n\"What are the people like?\" one young man asked me.\nI smiled, and thought about the shepherds, hosts and kids we had encountered along the way.\n\"Very welcoming,\" I answered. \"They can't wait to meet you.\"\nLocal info\nWith no hotels outside of the larger towns of Murghab and Khorog, local homestays and camping are the only accommodation options on the Pamir Highway.\nThis lack of amenities ensures only dedicated travelers visit Tajikistan.\nToday, the Pamir Highway has become a pilgrimage of sorts for cyclists, motorcyclists and four-wheel-drive enthusiasts, who frequent the region in the summer months.\nSome visitors book expeditions through travel agencies and tour companies abroad.\nBut it's easy to organize logistics on arrival -- often for cheaper -- with funds going directly to local operators.", "How this land of 'sorrow' got happy": "When the program featured a segment in 1993 called \"\nTango Finlandia\n,\" (watch it below) it brought to the attention of millions of Americans a certain Nordic nation about which they knew little. \nAnd what did the United States of America discover?\nCorrespondent Morley Safer and his team revealed Finland to be a place where \"melancholy, sorrow and shyness abound.\"\nThey also revealed \"no one looks anyone in the eye\" because \"to be noticed is an embarrassment, to take notice an affront.\" \nFinns themselves were \"grimly in touch with no one but themselves,\" they added, concluding: \"It's no surprise that Finland has one of the lowest birthrates and one of the highest suicide rates.\"\nOn a lighter note, the Finns loved to tango, hence the segment name.\nSkip forward two decades.\nNow Finland -- grimly-in-touch-with-no-one-but-themselves Finland -- finds itself atop the \nHappiness Equality Index\n Europe 2015 report.\nSimilar surveys\n also identify it as the happiest nation on the continent.\nThis leads to questions.\nWere Finns really that miserable back then? \nAnd are Finns really that happy right now?  \nKrista Huhtala-jenks, a senior officer from Finland's Ministry of Transport and Communications, is perfectly qualified to view Finland as both a Finn (she's a native) and an outsider (she moved abroad at 18 before returning at 29). \nA different world\nIf the Finns featured in \"Tango Finlandia\" seemed grim, Huhtala-jenks says they had reason to be that way. \nThe Finland of the 1990s was \"quite a different world,\" she says. \n\"Finland was under Soviet 'influence' for a very long time and the collapse of the Soviet Union had only happened a few years back.\" \nThrow in high alcohol consumption, troubling suicide rates and a \nnational economic depression\n and it was \"no wonder people weren't too happy.\"\nBut does the Land of a Thousand Lakes (despite the nickname, it's closer to a land of nearly 200,000 lakes) remain a place where sorrow abounds? \n\"I don't think it's true.\" \nConceding, \"we're still not great in small talk,\" Huhtala-jenks insists that doesn't mean \"we're extremely shy, overtly depressed or melancholic.\" \nShe acknowledges Finns can seem despondent to outsiders, which she blames largely on a few missing words.\nHuhtala-jenks's husband is Irish. \nWhen they first started dating, she would \"drive him nuts as I wouldn't use the words 'please' or 'excuse me'. He'd find it extremely rude.\" \nLuckily, she has an excellent excuse: Finns don't have those words.\n\"Those words simply don't exist in our language and hence using them does not come naturally.\" \nSunshine and darkness\nHer husband also committed a cultural faux pas. \nHuhtala-jenks was annoyed when he started talking before she finished.\n\"For Finns, it is extremely rude to interrupt someone. This leads to us making pauses or taking our time to talk.\" \nThus foreigners may interpret this basic display of Finnish silence/politeness as being \"shy or rude or even depressed.\" \nTo summarize: for many nationalities a conversation where no one says \"please\" and there are long pauses is troubling; in Finland it's par for the course.\nWhich isn't to say everything's sunshine.\n\"We're currently in one of our worst recessions,\" Huhtala-jenks says, noting the \nsuicide rate remains high \nand the heavy drinking can still be worrying.\nBeyond this, there are aspects of Finnish life in general that can be described as bleak. \nA recent Finnish National Gallery's exhibition \"\nThe Magic North\n\" on late 19th/early 20th century Finnish/Norwegian art had a heavy emphasis on the dark (parts of Finland experience 24 hours of it daily in the winter), the cold (temperatures can drop as low as -50 degrees Celsius/-58 Fahrenheit) and artists like Hugo Simberg, responsible for such cheerful masterworks as \"The Wounded Angel\" and \"The Garden of Death.\"\nBeyond this, Huhtala-jenks acknowledges some Finns still \"will never say 'hi' or look you in the eye,\" though she contends many others are \"overtly chatty, friendly and open.\" \nHeavy metal happiness\nOf course, the most important question still needs to be answered: What about the tango?\nThankfully, that's correct, both then and now.\n\"It is still popular in Finland: every year a tango king and queen are chosen.\" \nIt has, however, been surpassed by another form of music outsiders might not expect. \nRecent visitors to Helsinki would've spotted scores of posters for a appearance by the legendary English rock band Motorhead. \nIt's no surprise the city offers a warm welcome to Lemmy Kilmister.\n\"Finland is the heavy metal capital of the world,\" Huhtala-jenks declares, which is true by her definition of \"\nmost metal bands per inhabitant\n.\" \nShe credits this for some of the nation's improved spirits.\n\"You'd think this makes us depressed and gloomy, but the latest studies show that metal heads are some of the calmest and happiest people.\" \nHuhtala-jenks should know -- she proudly describes herself as \"a complete metal head.\"  \nBrush up on your Black Sabbath albums and return for an update ASAP, Mr. Safer.", "Busiest airport couldn't give biggest airliner a gate": "Here at the world's busiest airport -- with seven concourses and more than 200 gates -- a gate for the Super Jumbo Airbus A380 could not be provided. That forced Qatar Airways passengers to deplane Wednesday via mobile stairs and shuttle buses. \nAtlanta's airport has only one gate that can accommodate the A380 -- the world's largest airliner. The airport and resident hub carrier Delta Air Lines said they could not make that gate available. \nThe very public battle between Delta Air Lines, the world's second largest airline, and competitor Qatar Airways represents a microcosm of the national debate over whether the amount of alleged government subsidies foreign airlines receive violates international Open Skies agreements. \nHundreds of Qatar passengers were inconvenienced in Atlanta. Some wanted to know who to blame for not having a jetway where they could deplane. The airport and Delta blamed the airline for not giving enough notice that it was sending a Super Jumbo to an airport with only one gate that could handle such a big plane. \n\"It is a part of the common use lease agreement that we have,\" said airport spokesman Reese McCranie. \"We have to be given a certain amount of time when there is an equipment swap.\"\nFour to six Delta aircraft needed access to the A380 gate at the time the Qatar Airways plane requested access. \n\"... there wasn't anywhere Delta could put them,\" McCranie added.\nDelta offered as a \"solution\" a scenario that included parking the A380 on a remote stand near the international terminal. \"Despite limited time to solve for the request, Delta offered solutions to allow Qatar to use the gates while ensuring our own schedule remained accommodated during a heavy traffic period at the international terminal,\" Delta said in a written statement. \n\"Delta applies for accommodations months in advance,\" a Delta spokeswoman said. \"Qatar did not do that when asking for the A380.\" The A380 was scheduled for the flight at least a month in advance, according to several widely published reports. \nWhen asked if the airline gave enough notice to schedule access to the gate, Gunter Saurwein, Qatar Airways' vice president for the Americas, smiled and said, \"In general yes, we gave some lead time that we would be here.\" \nWhen asked if Delta may have deliberately prevented Qatar from using the gate, Sawrwein said, \"I do not want to comment on that. We as an airline don't finger point.\" \nThe crew deplaned the double-decker jet's 517 passengers in 45 minutes, including some disabled travelers. Although that's much longer than it usually takes to deplane via a jetway, Sawrwein described it as a success under the circumstances. \nLater, the outbound A380 flight experienced a two hour delay due to the same gate situation. \nUsing the Super Jumbo for this flight was a one-off for Qatar Airways' inaugural, making the gate dilemma unlikely to occur again on this route. Future Qatar Airways flights between Doha and Atlanta are scheduled to use Boeing 777-200LRs, which will have access to an airport gate and jetway. \nU.S. carriers claim that Qatar Airways and other Persian Gulf airlines receive billions of dollars in subsidies and have done so for many years, if not decades. They also allege that government handouts to Gulf carriers have enabled the funding of new routes and new aircraft.\nWhile Delta accuses Qatar of improperly using subsidies to fund new routes, many argue that Qatar offers passengers a higher quality experience at a more competitive price.\nThe feud between the two carriers escalated last March when Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said he'd launched the Atlanta route \"to rub salt into the wounds of Delta.\"", "Finding beauty in contentious Georgia": "My flight was stuck in Istanbul and we'd had only a small window to shoot in the off season resort city of Batumi, so a last minute substitute was called in. \nLike John Shaft, he's a complicated man. \nLike Wolf Blitzer, he's got the credentials and experience to tackle any subject. \nLike Bambi, a struggling medical student, he WILL pole dance if no other employment options exist. \nI'm talking, of course, about Zamir.\nIt's likely and unfortunate that you are probably only dimly aware of Georgia--the country, not the state. \nIt's tucked away beneath Russia, next to Turkey, a contentious, strategic piece of real estate under constant pressure.\nYou should know Georgia because it's nice.

Read the last story in this book.\n2. Write a response to the question.\n3. Ask a new question or use the same question again.\n4. Pass the book to the person next to you.\n5. If you don't want to write, please pass it on.\n6. Return to Eva in seat 42E when done.\nIn total, 33 people wrote in the book with stories of honeymoons, babies and a marriage proposal among the tales that emerged. \n\"I guess the loveliest thing is that if you receive the book from somebody and you read the last story, you basically get the other person's context, so the stories acted as a natural icebreaker,\" says Liparova.\nRevealing words \nSome entries were more personal than others. \n\"I think what surprised me most was just the level of how open people were about their personal life,\" she says.\n\"There was one story in which a woman mentioned visiting her elderly parents in Yorkshire [in northern England] and she essentially said, 'I think that was the last time I saw my dad.' That's a very intimate thing to share with strangers.\n\"Then there was a guy flying to San Francisco to ask his girlfriend to marry him -- and then you got this chain of cheering in the following stories. \n\"It was strange how incredibly quickly you can establish a sense of friendship and community if you go into a situation with complete curiosity.\"\n'Special moment'\nOne of the honeymooners on the plane was newlywed Kelly Barfoot, who was traveling with her husband following their wedding.\nHer entry read:\n\"2 days after getting married, I am sat on this plane for our honeymoon (a 3 week West Coast adventure!). To seat 59A, good luck with the proposal, I hope she says yes!\n\"It's good to see what a book like this can do to a bunch of random people, how it brings people together to share stories and adventures.\n\"My question for you is ... If you could only teach a child one thing, what would it be and why? 60A & 60B.\"\nBarfoot thought the book was a great idea.\n\"It certainly made you think more about what the other passengers' stories were and why they may have been on the flight,\" she says.\nAnd the launch of the project on their honeymoon flight made it seem all the more fitting. \n\"It kind of made the flight feel a bit more special, I'd say. Because it felt like we had something more to say than just 'we're going on holiday.'\"\nShe said her idea for the question she asked the next passenger was inspired by the knowledge that she and her husband were hoping to start a family soon.\n'Crazy excited'\nLiparova's favorite story?\nThat honor was bestowed on Flossie Williamson, who was on her way to starting a new life on the other side of the world with a man she had met just six weeks earlier.\n\"I am traveling to San Francisco en route to New Zealand,\" Williamson wrote. \"The reason for my trip which I have now done twice in a month is because when I visited last time I fell in love. \n\"All very cheesy but I am now moving to the other side of the world to start my life with a very funny Kiwi.\n\"I am crazy excited for the move and the adventures I will have.\n\"If I could click my fingers I would hope that everyone finds that special person and has the guts and courage to drop everything to be happy.\n\"Wish me luck.\n\"Written by a slightly crazy, happy girl in 62G.\"\nWilliamson remembers the book well. \n\"I had been watching this book being passed around and people's reactions for hours,\" she says. \"I was at the back of the plane so it took forever to get to me, and I was worried I was going to be asleep and miss out on it. \n\"I read lots of the other [stories], so many anniversaries, honeymoons. I especially liked the guy on his way to propose -- it seemed that love was most definitely in the air,\" she said.\nAs for her offering: \"I felt like a bit of a dork when I wrote it because at the time I was sat in my seat looking smug, nervous and grinning from ear to ear, and by telling my story, my neighbors would then know why! \n\"It couldn't have been a better flight to have written in it.\"\nIn response to this article, Virgin Atlantic sent out a tweet to help summon the co-authors who briefly crossed paths two years ago.\nLiparova's next project is to find the other 31 contributors. \n\"As a thank you for writing in the book, it would be great to connect with them and simply just hand over all the stories to them because at the end of the day, they are the co-writers of the whole project, so I think it's only fair.\"\n\u2022 For more plane tales, read \nEva's blog\n ", "Colorado River: 'Death from a thousand cuts'?": "", "How authentic is Hong Kong's bamboo pop-up bar?": "In fact, more than 4.5-million pieces of bamboo are used in construction each year, adding a unique twist to the city's already famous skyline. \nIn an attempt to give those of us on the ground a look at what Hong Kong's high life is all about, Tiger Beer has erected a Labor Day weekend bamboo pop-up bar from April 28-May 2.\nThe bar is located outside Excelsior Plaza in Causeway Bay. \nResidents and tourists can ascend its two Tiger-branded bamboo structures, which are 1.7 and 3.1 meters high. Each piece of bamboo bears  a one-line pep talk to help climbers conquer those heights.\nSince it typically takes two to three years of apprenticing until one can qualify for a license to experience the poles, participants at the Tiger Beer event use rock-climbing gear to clamber up the bamboo under the guidance of a professional climber.\nAfter it's all over?

We have educated diners.\" \n Nelson also says restaurants and the enjoyment that comes with dining out is a result of people looking for an outlet during the cold winters. Plus, the city's affordability and strong quality of life are inviting to chefs and restaurateurs looking for a cheaper alternative to cities like Chicago and New York.  \n\"Entrepreneurs can come here and get a good start, and that's one of the reasons we have a great food truck scene,\" Nelson said.  \n One restaurant that may exemplify the spirit of the city's gastronomic identity as well as any is \nGyst Fermentation Bar \nin the Whittier neighborhood. Sisters and owners Ki and Mel Guse opened Gyst in 2015 just off a vibrant stretch of ethnically diverse eateries referred to by locals as \"Eat Street.\" \nAlong a two-block stretch alone, you're able to choose from such wildly different cuisines including Greek, Vietnamese, Caribbean and Mexican, all within steps of German mainstay Black Forest Inn, which has been serving up classics like schnitzel and Hungarian goulash for over half a century.\n The sisters settled on this spot as the place to introduce eaters to a selection of foods and wines that provide an education on fermentation as much as they offer dynamic flavors. Owner Mel Guse says the fermentation process helps create many of the foods we eat every day, something that may surprise people.\n \"My background is coming from wine and cheese and those are two of my favorite everyday fermented foods,\" she says. \"When you wake up and have a cup of coffee, the beans have to go through the process of fermentation before they are ever roasted.\" \nShe says other fermented foods include bread, cured salamis, chocolate, yogurt, beer, pickles and a wide range of vegetables from yellow beets to purple daikon radishes.\n Guse says that the Gyst menu, which includes dozens of beers and wines from local breweries as well as small wineries the sisters discovered in many countries including France, Lebanon and the Baltic Sea Republic of Georgia, also represents \"an adventure of thinking\" with foods produced locally and from small farms in other states and abroad. \nTrying new things to see what works and what doesn't is an attitude that helped create one of the restaurant's signature dishes. \n\"I was opening my fridge one day and all I had was an English muffin, some peanut butter and some (Korean) Kimchi from the Farmer's market. And I said I'll give it a try. And lo and behold it kind of works and it's kind of addicting,\" Guse says. The menu's current version of the sandwich uses a toasted focaccia roll and green scallion. \n Another eye-catcher is the Gyst \"Motherboard,\" which includes French brie, cow's milk blue cheese from Vermont, a type of wild onion called a ramp, a scarlet turnip that has been fermented with juniper berry, a young pecorino sheep's milk cheese, spicy Spanish chorizo sausage and lonza, a dry cured pork loin from a meat company in Northeast Minneapolis. \nThe array of vibrant food colors and their thoughtful placement on a large wood cutting board almost force you to take a picture of the dish before you begin eating it. \n And if you needed another reason to incorporate into your diet more fermented foods and the probiotics they include, Guse says it could help you with weight loss and improve overall health. \"More than anything eating fermented foods really helps with digestion and helps to give you that good belly, that gut.\"", "Bourdain on how he picks 'Parts Unknown' destinations": "", "Best amusement park rides for summer": "Get ready to ride.\nVirtual reality roller coasters, 3-D and 4-D attractions and immersive \"dark\" rides that bring visitors into the storyline -- and sometimes even influence it -- will be heating up theme parks across the United States this summer. \n\"The virtual reality roller coaster experience is a new hot trend that hit the market this year and has the potential to be game changing,\" says Colleen Mangone, spokeswoman for the \nInternational Association of Amusement Parks & Attractions.\n \n\"The physical sensations of the roller coaster remain the same, but now they're immersed in the story,\" Mangone says.\"Guests see the superhero they're flying next to and their bodies are experiencing the flight through the sensation of the roller coaster.\"\nWorld's most popular amusement parks\nThe 3-D and 4-D attractions put riders in a make-believe world with the use of headsets, sounds, movable seats, sound, 3-D glasses and the 4-D effects of real wind, water and heat. \nMany are \"dark\" rides and not really coasters at all, located entirely inside a structure, where the riders can only see the ride elements.\nInteractive rides allow guests to fight for justice or another cause using specially designed laser guns or even just their hands -- and their experiences can change every time they get on board. \nKeeping customers engaged is big business. \nThis year, theme parks in the United States and Canada are expected to attract more than 390 million people and generate $22 billion in revenue, according to the IAAPA Global Theme and Amusement Park Outlook 2015-2019 report.\nTop 20 museums around the world\nThe competition to keep fans coming back is intense. \nSix Flags is opening more than 30 new rides across the country this year, a company spokeswoman confirmed.

Harvard Graduate School of Design students design the houses.\nThe spare, wooden tiny homes are situated in quiet, rural settings complete with fire pits outside ready for s'mores.\nThe Getaway houses rent for an average of $99 per night. The cabins are stocked with food and supplies that guests can purchase.\nStumbling into the 'tiny house movement'\nSome Americans who live in average-size homes are making the most of their properties by adding or converting existing buildings on their lots into tiny rentals.\nErin Gentry and her family built a lofted guest house on their property in Austin, Texas, because renovation plans for their 1928 bungalow involved losing their third bedroom.\nThey hadn't planned to rent it out, but the little house has been a huge hit with guests.\n\"We put it up on Airbnb, and people love it! We were booked solid for a year and a half, almost every day we had it available was booked,\" Gentry wrote in an email.\nGuests have had great things to say: \"The space itself is delightful, I felt like I was at camp climbing up the ladder for bed,\" wrote one Airbnb reviewer.\n\"It had everything that a hotel would have (but way more unique),\" another said.\nGentry and her wife and daughter learned about the tiny house movement after the fact, from guests who have considered building their own tiny homes. \nAt the moment, the three are living in the guest house until renovations on their primary home are completed this month. Then it's back to the rental market for their tiny dwelling.\nWee considerations\nIf you're traveling with a must-do checklist, staying in residential neighborhoods where local landlord/hosts can steer you toward new and overlooked spots can be an asset.  \nWhile private rentals in sought-after cities are also pretty economical -- nightly rates on many of these little homes are in the $100 to $150 range -- staying in a tiny house is really all about soaking up unique design details. \nUnusual angles, amazing ideas for optimizing space, reclaimed wood and retro appliances: These are tiny house charms.\nBut tiny does have its trade-offs. \nIf you're set on cooking a four-course meal, the appliances in some of these diminutive dwellings may not match your ambitions. Gentry's home in Austin has a sink, a microwave, a refrigerator and coffee and tea gear, but no stove or oven.\nThese houses are often in neighborhoods a few miles from city centers.

Oliver, \"The vibe of our hotel is summed up in one word: playful.\"\nOpal Sands Resort (Clearwater Beach, Florida)\nStanding 15 stories tall, the curved architecture of this 230-room resort is meant to give every guest fabulous views of the Gulf of Mexico, which are especially stunning at sunset. \n\"There's never a guest concern about what their view will be or a doubt that it will be phenomenal and exactly what they want to see on a beach vacation -- the sand and sea,\" says general manager Jeff Castner.  \nInside, the resort celebrates its coastal setting with many art pieces exclusively commissioned for the property, including mammoth fish sculptures, paintings of local wild and marine life and a wave-shaped installation made of 400 pieces of glass and metal. \nThe new Opal Sands Resort is a one-stop shop for sun worshipers: the sea is right outside the doors, there's a beachfront pool with a hot tub and the resort has four dining venues, including a beachside tiki bar. \nAmerican Beech (Greenport, New York)\nPreviously a carriage house, this months-old bed and breakfast in trendy North Fork is about a mile from the beach. \nBut its location around the corner from the harbor makes ferry jaunts to nearby Shelter Island easy. \nThe interior's simple design is topped with plenty of nautical flourishes, including rope details in the restaurant, anchor paraphernalia on the walls and stripes everywhere. \nIt's modern beach chic at its finest. \nIt's an intimate setting with only five suites, but the seasonal restaurant downstairs is a popular hangout for locals and visitors.\nGuests of the B&B get priority reservations. ", "10 dishes every visitor to Argentina needs to try": "While beef is the backbone of Argentina's daily diet, there are plenty of other tasty treats awaiting the Obamas in the world's eighth-largest country.\nBesides taking inspiration from Italian and Spanish migrants, Argentina's dishes also feature ingredients from the Andean northwest as well as Patagonia in the south.\nReady to start eating? \nHere are 10 of the top dishes every visitor to Argentina should try. \nEmpanadas\nArgentina's favorite street food, these stuffed dough pockets are similar to Puerto Rico's empanadilla or a Cornish pasty. \nTranslating as \"wrapped in bread,\" empanadas come baked or fried and can be veggie or carnivorous.\nCommon fillings include chicken, cheese and ham, sweetcorn, caprese or blue cheese. \nBeef -- either chopped or sliced by hand -- is always a popular option, though seasoning such as cumin, spring onion, boiled egg or potato depends on the province of origin. \nLook out for regional specialties, too: quinoa and goat's cheese in the northwest province of Jujuy, or lamb in Patagonia. \nSo how to tell the difference between flavors? \nMost empanader\u00edas provide a handy repulgue (a term used to describe the method used to fold the edges of the dough) map as a guide through the different crimped edges, which denote flavors.\nChoripan \nAnother cheap and cheerful street food hit, choripan is usually served as an entree at an asado (barbecue). \nBut thanks to its hands-on shape, this sausage sandwich (where chorizo or sausage teams up with pan or bread) is an ideal snack for travelers on the go. \nYou can slather it in chimichurri, a spicy sauce made from oregano, parsley, garlic, chili flakes and red wine vinegar -- or salsa criolla, a tomato, onion and red bell pepper variant. \nWhile chorizo is usually made from pork, boar sausages can also be found in some restaurants.\nPizza\nWhile Argentinian pies might share some physical resemblances with their Neapolitan cousins -- they have a circular form and dough base.\nThat's where the similarities end. \nInch-high crusts tend to go light on tomato sauce while overcompensating with so much Argentinian-style mozzarella cheese, it drips down the side.\nGarnishes include green olives, oregano, or dried chili flakes. \nAn entire cheese-and-tomato pizza is often simply referred to as una muzza. \nSome traditional pizzerias in Buenos Aires sell by the slice, designed to be eaten standing at the bar. \nCustomers can also order faina, a filling slice of chickpea pancake, to soak up the gooey cheese.\nMilanesa\nAnother Argentinian dish with Italian influence is milanesa, known as escalope in the rest of the world. \nUsually made from silverside -- a round of beef from the outside of the leg -- or chicken breast, the meat is hammered down to a thin cut before being bathed in breadcrumbs, then either fried or baked. \nToppings, however, raise this dish's excitement levels. \nA caballo (on horseback) means topped with a fried egg, a la napolitana ups the ante with cheese and tomato sauce, while a la suiza uses gruyere. \nLarger appetites should order completa, with ham, cheese and tomato sauce. Best accompanied with French fries and a token salad.\nProvoleta\nThis soft, round, provolone cheese is a fairly bland eating experience -- until it's slapped on the grill. \nProvoleta, made from cow's milk, then turns into gooey goodness and is a classic starter to an Argentinian asado, or barbecue. \nGrilled in a specially sized skillet or a simple foil dish, provoleta is often topped with oregano and should be slightly crisp on the outside yet melted on the inside. \nFor a creamy yet acidic taste, try the goat's milk provoleta. \nAsado\nBeef's so tempting in Argentina that even vegetarians have been known to succumb to its wiles. \nThe best way to sample it is at an asado, which refers to both a barbecue as well as a traditional way of grilling beef. \nIt's the most important social event in Argentina, bringing together friends and families every weekend. \nA multi-step meal that can last several hours, entrees include choripan, morcilla (blood sausage) and provoleta before moving onto organ meats such as mollejas (beef sweetbreads), chinchulines (chitterlings) and rinones (kidneys). \nBuilding up to the main game, we recommend trying matambrito de cerdo (pork flank steak) drizzled in lemon juice before tucking into one of several cuts such as tender ojo de bife (ribeye); bife de chorizo (sirloin), which comes with a strip of fat; tasty asado de tira (short ribs); and full-flavored entrana (skirt steak).\nWhile an asado at an Argentinan's home is the most legitimate experience, some restaurants serve the next best thing -- a parrillada, which is a small portable grill complete with glowing coals that keeps cuts warm.\nLlama\nEating llama steak is the norm in Argentina's northwest, given that the camelid is well adapted to the Jujuy province's 2,000-plus meters above sea level altitude. \nWhile its flavor is more rustic and earthy than beef, fat levels are lower, which makes it a healthy alternative. \nIt can be sampled in empanadas, a stew or as a standalone steak. Some swankier restaurants even use it in carpaccio or tartare.\nHumita\nEaten as a savory snack or a main course, humita is the ultimate corn tribute. Leaf packages are untied to reveal the corn mash inside. \nThe whole package is either steamed or boiled. \nDating back to pre-Columbian times, humita is eaten around the Andean region, including Chile, Bolivia and Peru. \nMade with fresh corn and milk, onion, spices and sometimes goat cheese are added to pep it up.\nLocro\nA hearty stew, locro is a national dish traditionally served on May 25, the date marking Argentina's May Revolution. \nMade from white corn, beef or pork, tripe and red chorizo, as well as other vegetables including white beans, squash and pumpkin, and seasoned with cumin and bay leaf, this tasty meal in a bowl is an ideal winter warmer. \nIt can be ramped up with a dash of quiquirimichi, a hot salsa made from paprika, spring onion and chili.\nAlso worth a trying, carbonada is a similar dish that includes sweetcorn that's served inside a baked, seasoned pumpkin.\nDulce de leche\nSome Argentinians would argue that licking dulce de leche (caramelized milk and sugar sauce) from a spoon is a meal in itself. \nHowever, this sweet and sticky salsa usually accompanies desserts such as flan.\nA better invention is dulce de leche-flavor helado. \nAny ice-cream parlor that didn't stock it would soon go out of business; the bonus is that Argentinian ice-cream is thick and creamy, giving Italian gelato a decent run for its money. \nFor the ultimate sugar rush, DDL cones can be topped up with a little (or a lot of) DDL sauce.", "Dramatic first look at world's highest, longest glass-bottom bridge": "Travelers will soon be able to walk across the world's \nlongest and highest glass-bottom bridge\n, which spans two cliffs in China's Hunan province.  \nThis week, workers were photographed installing the bridge's first piece of glass.  \nSet against dramatic landscapes in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, the bridge is 430 meters long, six meters wide and hovers over a 300-meter vertical drop.\nConstruction on the bridge was originally expected to be finished at the end of 2015.\nIt's now set to open in May this year.\nWorld's highest catwalk?\nDesigned by Israeli architect Haim Dotan, the glass-bottom bridge will also feature the world's highest bungee jump and serve as a runway for fashion shows.\nHanging above Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon, it will be able to hold up to 800 people at once.\nDigital renderings of the bridge highlight the architectural firm's vision -- to build a glass structure that fades into the clouds.\nStunning as the view is, tourists will likely tread carefully.\nIn October last year, \ncracks appeared\n in a mountainside glass walkway in Yuntaishan Scenic Park, in China's central Henan province, just two weeks after opening.\nThe incident sent visitors running and screaming in panic, according to witnesses.\nPark officials said the damage was superficial and posed no threat to safety.\nRead next: The end of 'weird buildings' in China?

I just don't think that they care.\"\nIn a perhaps bold move, the TSA has opened its experimental lines just days before Memorial Day -- one of the busiest travel holidays of the year in the United States. \nAtlanta's airport is projected to handle a record 90,000 passengers per day this holiday weekend (including Thursday), the TSA said. \nHere's what you need to know about the experimental screening lines: \nThey seem faster and more convenient\nAll baggage is placed inside bins that are tracked by a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. \nThese bins automatically move along conveyor rollers. \nThe bins are moved out of the way if the bags inside them need to be further inspected by a TSA officer. \nThis way the line can continue moving.\n\"I was able to go around a few people who were waiting for their bins to go through,\" said businessman Ashish Thomas. \"I thought it was great. It keeps things moving.\" \nBins automatically recirculate to the front of the lanes after passengers collect their bags. \nA special area apart from but near the front of the line is designated for passengers to take off shoes, belts and other articles of clothing.\nThis allows others to keep moving through the line. \nTSA spokesman Mark Howell said the agency is looking for a 25-35% improvement on efficiency per lane in a best case scenario.\nThey probably don't add security\nFormer TSA assistant administrator Chad Wolf is familiar with the new system. \nHe said the TSA has been considering these ideas for years. \nIn fact, similar systems are already in use at airports in London and Amsterdam. \nThey don't necessarily provide any additional security for screening passengers, he said. \n\"I would recommend them looking at other technologies for the checkpoint that not only speed up time but that also increase security,\" Wolf said. \nHe suggested the TSA use the same technology that it uses for checked baggage for screening carry-on bags. \n\"It's not simple and it's not cheap but that's the solution,\" he said. \n\"It allows travelers to leave laptops in their bag, leave liquids in their bag, which speeds up the through-put,\" Wolf said. \n\"It increases security because you have computer algorithms looking for those prohibited items like liquid explosives and you remove that human element \u2014 like the screeners staring at that screen, stopping that conveyor belt.\"\nAn airline is helping to pay for them\nDelta Air Lines has paid $1 million to research, develop and build the lanes in Atlanta. \nThe carrier said that comes out to less than $200,000 per lane. \nAlso, Delta is providing staff at no-cost to help the TSA with non-screening duties. \nAt other airports, American Airlines said it has set aside $4 million to hire contract workers for non-screening TSA tasks, in addition to $17 million American says it already shells out each year on resources to help shorten lines. \nTSA experts are testing the new lanes side-by-side against traditional TSA lanes. \nDon't expect to see them anytime soon\nThe lines are being tested only at the Atlanta airport, nowhere else in the country.\nThey'll remain there indefinitely according to the TSA, until the agency has collected and analyzed enough data to make an informed decision about next steps. \nIf successful, the TSA says the new lanes could be adjusted and copied at other airports. \nIf that happens, it could lead to faster, more efficient security lanes in as soon as five years, said one TSA official.\n\"Five years is way too long to scale this,\" said Gil West, Delta Air LInes' chief operating officer. \"We will help enable the acceleration of the deployment.\" \nIn the meantime, fliers can keep an eye on TSA's phone app called My TSA, beginning in mid-June. \nIt's expected to start posting more accurate wait times at TSA checkpoints.\nAs always, airlines recommend arriving at airports two hours before scheduled departure times for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.

And should the tourists be staying away?\n\"We feel very safe here but it's sad to see tavernas we love completely empty,\" says Gill Greenhall from the UK.\nGreenhall is a regular visitor each spring to Lesbos, which is home to 330 bird species and is the number one birdwatching site in Europe.\nBut this year, she's an exception.\nEmpty flights\n\"The flight was half-empty on the way here --  first time we saw that,\" says Greenhall. \"We know the situation has put off people from coming but it shouldn't.\"\nIt's not just the birdwatchers.\nAccording to the \nRegional Authority of the North Aegean Islands\n, 75% of international flights and 35% of domestic flights have been canceled so far in 2016.\nMORE: Naxos: Lush Greek island delivers the good life\nMost cruise ships have diverted from the island and some travel companies have stopped offering vacation packages altogether.\nThe \nLesvos Hoteliers Association\n says room bookings are down 90%.\nThe arrival of the migrants came as Greece was still reeling from a painful financial crisis that nearly saw it go crashing out of Europe's single currency eurozone.\n\"People fleeing from war met people suffering from a socio-economic crisis,\" says Maria Kaplanelli, who manages the Pagotelli ice cream shop and the \nNatura Guesthouse\n in the village of Skala Kallonis with her husband Yiorgos Eleftheriou.  \nWhat could've been a year-long disaster, however, seems to have brought out a sense of resilience, hospitality and understanding among islanders, she says.\n\"There could've been a conflict, but there was no conflict. That was the magic of it.\n\"It was shocking, a situation above us all. As an island we helped, we evolved and we overcame. We can't be anything but positive to move on.\"\nSense of pride\n\"Last year refugees walked for hours in the heat,\" says Eleftheriou as he drives on an empty country road lined with lush olive trees and a sweeping seaside view.\n\"Islanders tried to assist before there was help from abroad by offering water, giving rides, shelter and food.\n\"I am proud that our hands were outstretched to welcome them.\"\nKaplanelli says that since the island now has the infrastructure it needs to help the migrants, locals are now figuring out how they can win back tourists.\n\"Now, for us as business owners, it's a matter of getting organized,\" she adds.\nShe and other members of the \nMolyvos Tourism Association\n, a private business group formed in the face of the economic crisis to promote Lesbos as a tourist destination, organized a group of Greece-based writers from \nTravel Bloggers Greece\n to tour Lesbos.\nMORE: Which Greek island should you go to? \n\"I was curious to see the situation with my own eyes, because the idea out there is that tourists don't want to be here,\" says Chrysoula Manika, one of the bloggers, from Greece.\n\"I find the shores sparkling, no boats or life jackets,\" she adds.\n\"Now that I'm here, I can say Lesbos is one of my favorite Greek islands because of the incredible landscapes. So, it's even more disappointing to know travel companies are still pulling out.\"\nCelebrity visitors\nFollowing a recent deal between Turkey and the EU that restricted migration routes, refugee arrivals dropped dramatically.\nNow, Lesbos's 90,000 residents, tipped to be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for their humanitarian efforts, are settling into a new normalcy.  \nMany public buses now carry bilingual Greek and Arabic signage.\nThey're surrounded by NGO workers from around the world instead of international tourists.\nRecently, headliners like Angelina Jolie, the Pope and Queen Rania of Jordan paid short visits to the capital's refugee camp, a guarded property in the port of Mytilene lined with small trailer homes.\nMORE: And the world's best island is ... \nDespite Lesbos's achievements, Anastasios M. Perimenis, general manager for local development company \nETAL\n, says it's too late for this summer's tourism season.\n\"People may say it's sad that Lesbos is in a sense being punished because we are losing tourists in the aftermath of our humanitarian efforts.\n\"The reality is that people go on holiday to avoid hardships and everyday life.\"\nPerimenis says this Lesbos needs to come up with a new tourism plan.\n\"What we've been through as an island has shown we can work together to do more,\" he says.\n'Beautiful destination'\nThrough increased collaboration he says the goal is to attract \"visitors\" rather than \"tourists.\"\nVisitors, he says, seek authentic cultural and gastronomic experiences rather than low-cost flights and cheap hotel stays.\n\"With 30 charter flights per month it's enough to offer a room, the sea, the bars and sun.\n\"Without those flights Lesbos must think beyond, offering options to attract those who want to hike through the chestnut forest, learn about the petrified forest, discover local gastronomy and ouzo culture, walk the castle walls of our island and explore the villages.\n\"This is the opportunity for Lesbos.\"\nKaplanelli and Eleftheriou realize there aren't any short-term solutions to bring tourists back, a dilemma which continues to hit at their own livelihoods and for so many more on the island.\n\"All we can say is that Lesbos is completely different from one year ago, on many levels.  But it's always been a beautiful destination and always will be.  \n\"We understand the perception out there, so for every traveler that decides to be with us this summer, it will be appreciated greatly,\" says Kaplanelli.\n\"To him or her I would simply say thank you. I know you'd have a great time.\"\nMORE: Migrant drownings rise by a third this year on Mediterranean, U.N. says ", "World's best outdoor photography winners are ...": "Not only does he have a girlfriend who joins him when he goes freediving with jellyfish, a shot he took of her swimming with the creatures has scooped him one of the top prizes in a leading photo contest.\nKarbus' image was named winner in the Under Exposed category of 2015's \nOutdoor Photographer of the Year\n competition. \nSeven other stunning photographs from 12,000 entrants were named as finalists.\nThe overall winner will be announced on February 13 at the Telegraph Outdoor Adventure & Travel Show in London.\nThe contest is sponsored by UK-based \"Outdoor Photography\" magazine and Swedish outdoor equipment company Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven.\nThe prize for the overall winner from the adult categories is a place on a dog sled expedition to the Arctic in spring 2016. \nNow in its fifth year, the competition honors what organizers say is photography showcasing the magnificent diversity of our planet, with the 2015 category winners covering everything from a remote Pakistan schoolroom to a spectacular Australian thunderstorm. \nThe winning photographers come from the UK, Australia, Austria and the Czech Republic, with 15-year-old Anastasia Ziavra from Greece taking the Young Photographer of the Year prize for her moonlit picture of a beach. \nThis year, 150 of the best entries have been gathered into a book by Ammonite Press, with descriptions written by the photographers and details of the cameras used. \n\"Outdoor Photographer of the Year: Portfolio One\" will be published in March and is available to pre-order from the \nOutdoor Photographer of the Year\n website.

they're protected by the gods they're channeling. \nWith so many sights blinding the eyes, it's easy to forget that the whole place goes veggie for nine days.\nIt might seem as though it's the same

Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\"I'm one of those nerds of the history of the United States,\" Burns said. \"I may be American history's biggest fan.\"\nDecades later, Burns' oldest daughter, Sarah, is 33 and a mother herself. At last, Burns' first children's book, \"Grover Cleveland, again!\" is coming out in July. \nSince we know Burns loves both the U.S. presidents and national parks, CNN asked him to help us commemorate the National Park Service turning 100 this year. \nBurns picked the presidents who did the most to create and protect the nature and history cared for by the National Park Service. \nYosemite's presidential protector\nFor the very idea that some or part of our natural resources should be set aside for present and future generations, Burns thanks President Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865). \nIn the middle of the Civil War, with casualties mounting, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation to set aside part of what is now Yosemite National Park, even though Lincoln had never seen it. \n\"The land was set aside not for kings or noblemen but for everybody else,\" said Burns.\n\"Americans love their manifest destiny,\" said Burns, referring to the 19th century belief that justified the United States' expansion across the continent. The congressional bill signed into law by Lincoln says,\n \n\" 'but save a few places for everybody,' \" Burns said. \nCNN's National Park Service centennial coverage\nCreator of the world's first national park\nBefore any member of Congress proposed creating the nation's first official national park at Yellowstone, the plan had been to set aside the land and give it to a state to protect, as had been done with Yosemite. \nThere was just one problem: Yellowstone was in three territories -- Wyoming, Idaho and Montana -- and none of them were states yet. \nThat's why President Ulysses S. Grant (1869 -1877) signed legislation that \"created the world's first national park,\" said Burns. \nGrand Canyon's ardent advocate\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt\n, who was known as the \"conservation president,\" signed the 1906 Antiquities Act into law.  \nThe act establishes that archeological sites on public lands are important public resources and authorizes the President to designate landmarks, structures and objects of historic or scientific interest as national monuments. \nRoosevelt (1901-1909) used his authority to protect about 230 million acres of public land, including five national parks, through Congress, and eight national monuments, under the Antiquities Act. \nCongress fought him on turning the Grand Canyon into a national park, so he named it a national monument under the Antiquities Act. (It became a national park in 1919.)\nAmerica's first national parks\n\"Roosevelt was given one of greatest legislative gifts ever -- the Antiquities Act, which permitted him to set aside small parcels of public land for their scientific or historic value, \" said Burns. \"Being a naturalist, he was saving these places for all people for all time.\"\nLaunching the National Park Service \nPresident Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921) is better known for helping create the Federal Reserve, signing the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote (reversing his position), attempting to keep the United States out of World War I and trying to create a United Nations-like League of Nations. \nBut he also made a contribution to preservation. \nOn August 25, 1916, Wilson signed the Organic Act, the result of a decadeslong effort that created the National Park Service. \nAt the time of his signing the legislation, the new bureau took over the protection of the existing 14 national parks, 21 monuments, two reservations and those yet to be established. \nExpanding protections\nIn some ways, our modern national park service is based on Franklin D. Roosevelt, Burns said. \n\"What Roosevelt began to understand is that it's not just about protecting natural wonders or magnificent falls of Yosemite or the Grand Canyon or the diversity of the Everglades,\" he said. \"It's also about social history.\"\nUnder Roosevelt (1933-1945), the park service took over the responsibility of the War Department's parks and monuments, the U.S. Forest Service's national monuments (and most monuments going forward) and the national capital parks. \nRoosevelt also created the Civilian Conservation Corps, which during the heart of the Depression provided work  developing national parks, forests, historic sites and other natural sites. \n\"As freedom evolves, so does the idea of the park service,\" said Burns. \nIncreasing access for the middle class\nWith the development of the national highway system under President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961), National Park Service sites were overwhelmed by visitors. \nIn 1956, National Park Service Director Conrad L. Wirth launched the \"Mission 66\" program to upgrade facilities and management by the park service's 50th anniversary in 1966. (By 1966, Lyndon Johnson was President.) \nThat's why many park service sites have visitor centers, hundreds of employee residences and employee training centers.\n'We had grown up'\nWhen Ken Burns starts talking about the national parks, he finds much to love about the presidents and the park sites they protected. \nThere are the bison that still exist because Yellowstone's protections saved them, said Burns, and the Everglades, which is one of the most diverse environments anywhere. \n\"It's the only place where alligators and crocodiles both exist, and there's such a diversity of plant and bird life,\" he said. \nBurns also appreciates the National Park Service sites that remind us of our difficult and painful past.\nManzanar National Historic Site\n, where many Japanese-Americans were interned during World War II, protected in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush is one of those sites. \nSo is the \nLittle Rock Central High School Historic Site\n, which was protected in 1998 under President Bill Clinton, and is still a working high school.\n\"I know of no country that has copied (that decision) to the extent we have, acknowledging all aspects of our complicated place in history,\" Burns said. ", "Wonder walls: Inside India's exquisitely decorated Haveli mansions": "Havelis, mostly built more than a century ago by India's Marwari community, are mansions adorned with frescoes so exquisite that they've become a tourist attraction. \nThe Marwari amassed great fortunes in cotton, indigo and opium trading. \nThey then hired artists to decorate their huge homes to boast their wealth.\nThe colorful wall murals are often visual diaries of the owners.\nDaily life and travel memoirs are depicted, as well as popular imagery, folk mythology and even erotica.\nDisappearing havelis\nOver the years, most of these heritage havelis crumbled away to be replaced by modern structures or had their artworks painted over. \nToday, the best chance of seeing them in their glory is by visiting northeastern Rajasthan state's Shekhawati region, where there's a cluster of more than 2,000 painted havelis.\nA haveli is usually multi-story, organized around two courtyards.\nTraditionally, the opulent outer courtyard is strictly reserved for meetings and trade while the inner courtyard is home to a large extended family. \nSome havelis have been converted into hotels or museums.\nMost remain privately owned but caretakers will sometimes show visitors around for a small fee (Rs50-100, or $0.8-1.5).\nLived-in artworks\nThe best place to see century-old frescoes up-close is at\n \nVivaana Culture Hotel \n(\nChuri-Ajitgarh, Mandawa; +91 98 1127 6231\n). \nThe 23-room hotel is composed of two 19th century havelis, restored by hotelier Atul Khanna.\nA heritage lover and an entrepreneur, Khanna traveled more than 2,000 kilometers before chancing upon these aging buildings. \n\"It took us more than five years of negotiation with multiple owners to buy these havelis,\" Khanna tells CNN. \"Then restoration took us another three good years.\"\n\"The biggest challenge was to get the plumbing done for each private bathroom.\" \nIt's easy to spend days admiring the intricate walls with their illustrations of religious stories, portraits and floral patterns. \nAlongside original features, new luxury elements have been added -- private baths, minimalist chic furnishing and a swimming pool.\nRooms 103, 104 and 106 are the most impressive with detailed wall art, painted floors and grand baths. \nAdding to the atmosphere, local bards gather each evening to sing their high pitch tunes. \nThe hotel is a great starting point for exploring neighboring towns and guided day trips of other havelis can be organized. \nNawalgarh \nLocated 22 kilometers from the Vivaana Culture Hotel, the town of Nawalgarh has one of the region's highest concentration of painted havelis -- close to 200. \nKamal Morarka Haveli Museum\n (\nNaya Bazar, Nawalgarh; contact: Dr Hotchand, conservation director, +91 93 5176 7266\n) was built in the 1900s by the prominent Morarka family. \nThe outer and inner courtyards are decorated with mythology-themed murals and the entrance has a carved wooden door surrounded by mirror work. \nKamal M Morarka, a descendent of the family, decided to turn his \"treasure house of frescoes\" into a museum in 1995.\nConservator Dr. Hotchand has been working for years to preserve close to 700 original artworks. \n\"The most interesting part of these frescoes are the indigenous techniques and materials,\" Hotchand tells CNN. \n\"Earth color was derived from minerals, blue from indigo, white from lime, red from vermilion and black from kohl.\"  \nNot far from Kamal Morarka sits the grand \nDr Ramnath A Podar Haveli Museum\n (\nRambilas Podar Road, Nawalgarh; +91 15 9422 5446\n).\nConstructed in 1902, the museum has more than 750 restored frescoes that cover more than 11,200 square meters. \nReligious deities, folklore and portraits of British men and women are all depicted.   \nThe 19th-century \nBhagton ki Choti Haveli \n(\nNear Podar Gate\n)\n \nhas some of the most eclectic wall imagery. \nThe entrance is adorned with interesting murals of a locomotive and a ship. \nThe facade of the outer courtyard is covered with a scene composed of a royal procession, a portrait of Queen Victoria, English memsahibs and some religious imagery. \nAmong favorites is a room on the upper floor with a uniformed pipe smoker with a small dog on his shoulder. \nA caretaker at Bhagton ki Haveli walks visitors through the murals for a small fee. \nMandawa, Dundlod and Fatehpur \nCompleted in 1875, the \nSeth Arjundas Goenka Haveli \n(\nDundlod; contact:\n \nMohan Goenka; +91 98 8405 3841\n) sits between Mandawa and Nawalgarh.\nIn addition to the colorful murals, the mansion once occupied by the Goenka family includes a display depicting life in a traditional haveli. \nA booklet of cotton samples from Kettelwell Bullen & Co. highlights the family's trade in textiles. \nMandawa town is home to more than 175 havelis. \nMost of them are either closed or occupied by families of caretakers, but many allow visitors to take a look for a fee. \nThe best place to start is at \nChokhani Double Haveli\n (\nWard 5, Mandawa\n). \nVisitors can only get as far as the outer courtyard, but the artworks there are worth the visit, especially the paintings of Hindu deity Krishna. \nThe 140-year-old \nSnehi Ram Ladia Haveli \n(\nMandawa\n) is also open to visitors.  \nMeanwhile, interesting frescoes can be seen just by strolling through the local market, which is lined with havelis. \nLe Prince Nadine Cultural Centre\n (\nPulia, Fatehpur\n) in the village of Fatehpur is a gem. \nBuilt in 1802 by the Devras family, this haveli has been restored and turned into an artists' residency and gallery by French painter Nadine Le Prince. \nLe Prince manages and guides tours at the building with some volunteers. \nA heritage walk around the city is also offered.\nHow to get there\n: Shekhawati can be easily reached by road via Delhi (260 kilometers) and from Jaipur (175 kilometers).", "Rest stops: A dying slice of Americana": "This was a state- and county-road world of two-lane blacktop ribbons stretching to the horizon, of epic Jack Kerouac road trips, of small towns in the middle of nowhere.\nAnd of rest stops -- lovingly crafted pauses that act as showcases of regional history or natural wonders as well as places to picnic or take a break.\nIt's a world that's largely been lost to progress and faster living.\nBut away from the major highways, some of the old rest stops survive -- although they're vanishing fast.\nPhotographer \nRyann Ford\n has been documenting this dying slice of Americana since a 2007 move to Austin, Texas, rekindled memories of family road trips as a kid.\n\"Shortly after I moved here I would get sent on commercial assignments for magazines around Texas, and so I was driving a lot of the back roads and highways,\" she says. \"And that's when I started noticing these little roadside rest stops and tables. \n\"We had them in California, but they weren't quite as historic and photogenic.\"\nFord was immediately struck by the \"mid-century architecture\" of these structures -- many built as part of an interstate road-building program initiated by President Eisenhower in the 1950s.\n\"I've always been a minimalist, and when you see these little tables set down on the landscape, they're so photogenic,\" Ford says. \"The more I saw of them, the more I thought this would be a really, really good photo series.\"\nFord realized she'd have to move fast. \nHer research revealed that in many states, rest stops were being torn down as recession cutbacks meant no cash to pay for their upkeep.\n\"When I Googled it back in 2009, all these articles started popping up about how, all over the country, the rest stops were being closed and demolished,\" she says. \n\"After seeing how cool they were and finding out about their history, it was really disheartening to see what was happening. \n\"That really motivated me to make this a project rather than just shoot it for fun.\"\nHer new book, \n\"The Last Stop: \nVanishing Rest Stops of the American Roadside\n,\" includes many of the 400 rest stops she's photographed across 19 states.\nIt's a loving tribute to these modest monuments to travel. \nHer images show picnic tables, toilets and shelters -- clearly built to last -- dwarfed by the majestic panoramas of the American landscapes they've served for decades.\n\"They really give the traveler a sense of a bygone era,\" Ford says. \n\"We don't travel like this anymore. Now we're just trying to get from point A to point B as quick as possible, whether it's a direct flight or the fastest highway. \n\"And even when we do need to make stops, they're just drive through, quick and easy. \n\"Back in the day it was more about the journey than the destination, and families would really stop to take their time, make a meal and enjoy where they were traveling through.\"\nMany of the rest stops, she points out, were also built to show off what a state had to offer and were decorated with paraphernalia such as wagon wheels, teepees and even rockets.\n\"They really gave something you don't see any more,\" she says.\nFord clearly isn't alone in her appreciation.\nShe funded her book via the Kickstarter website and was \"blown away\" when it easily clocked up pledges of more than $35,000 in a matter of weeks. \n\"I think the project has a lot of broad appeal,\" she says of the orders that have come in from across the States as well as Europe, Asia and Australia.\n\"There are the baby boomers who remember them, the millennials who don't remember visiting them as a kid but are drawn to the vintage look and the modern architecture.\"\nFord says she's encountered plenty of backlash against the demolition of rest stops.\n\"A lot of states, Texas specifically, have actually built some new rest stops,\" she says. \"They're nice, with great modern features, and Wi-Fi and tornado shelters.\n\"But it's kind of bittersweet because they don't have that historical charm. And with all that new technology, they're just not as much fun.\"", "Is this the world's most adventurous man?": "\"I was simply doing a safari thing and thought Kilimanjaro would be a fun challenge,\" says the 56-year-old from Utah. \"It was just an add-on to the trip.\"\nFour years later, after he successfully scaled Alaska's \nDenali\n, he got the idea of tackling the highest summits in every continent. \nIn the years that followed, he tackled these \"seven summits\" one by one: South America's Mount Aconcagua, Asia's Mount Everest, Europe's Mount Elbrus and Oceania's Carstensz Pyramid.\nHe completed the mission in 2012 when he made it to the top of Antarctica's Mount Vinson. \nTwo months later, he decided to tackle the \nseven seas\n. \nHe started by sailing across the North Atlantic -- from Gibraltar to Saint Martin -- in 2013 on his Lagoon 560 catamaran, AMARA. \nNo need to go it alone\nAfter conquering his last mountain, Frey sought out an activity that would allow him to include his wife and seven-year-old daughter, Lily. \n\"We were looking for something that still met my need for adventure but was still a family activity,\" he says. \nHis wife and daughter joined him on the second leg of his second journey -- across the South Pacific -- and continued to join him at various points throughout. \n\"We made it a true family adventure as we circumnavigated along the way,\" he says.\nHe later crewed on a square rigger -- the Bank Europa -- on a journey through the Southern Ocean, then boarded the Aventura III for his trip through the Arctic Ocean (the boat was specifically designed with large, heavy steel hulls that are able to cut through the ice).\nHe just sailed his final leg on the North Pacific Ocean in the Clipper Round the World race as a crew member on Visit Seattle. \nHe finished the race on April 17.\nThis makes him, he says, the first person to have ever climbed the world's seven summits and sailed the seven seas (Guinness World Records is in the process of corroborating). \nMORE: Denali summit: Amazing images from North America's highest mountain \n'Just an ordinary guy'\nBefore he became an adventurer, Frey had several other careers, first as a senior director for technology company Cisco, then as a senior official in the Utah Governor's Office. \nToday, Frey also works as a motivational speaker on the topics of success and achievement.\nWhat he isn't, he maintains, is an athlete. \n\"I'm not a sailing or mountaineering expert; I'm just an ordinary guy, a guy who happened to choose these challenges in order to reach my own potential,\" he says. \nThe passage, he notes, has not been without its challenges. \nHe recalls that when he was 17,000 feet up Denali, he encountered a storm that completely blanketed him.\n\"We were stuck in the tent for six days -- six long days -- waiting for the storm to abate. It was a complete whiteout.\"\nPart of what made it easy to keep going was the knowledge that he could always turn back. \nWith his wife, he gave himself permission to do that if his journey ever got dangerous.\n\"I made a deal with my wife that none of these risks were worth it if I had to go beyond the comfort zone of where I felt I couldn't retreat,\" he says.\n\"I always had the opportunity to go try again another time without feeling like it was the end of the world.\"\nWhat do you do with a seasick sailor?\nThere have been few challenges Frey hasn't been able to overcome. \nOne trial, however, has proved too formidable to conquer, even for him: seasickness.\n\"It never gets better,\" he says. \"The first three days whenever I leave port are miserable. \n\"I continually battle it whenever I go below deck.\"\nWhat's important, says Frey -- and it's a point he emphasizes on the lecture circuit -- isn't the obstacles one faces but how one works with those obstacles.\n\"I know storms come and go. Our attitude is more important than the severity of those storms,\" he says. \nThe main lesson he's learned from his journey, however, is to not put limits on one's own potential.\n\"Sometimes we predefine our comfort zone, or put boxes around what we think we're capable of. \n\"I think I have a much stronger inherent sense of what I'm capable of achieving as an individual.\"", "Dip into Colombia's messiest attraction": "\"Don't take anything into the volcano,\" she said. \"Anything you bring will be destroyed.\"\nBelow me loomed the Cartagena Mud Volcano -- or Volc\u00e1n de Lodo El Totumo in Spanish -- a 50-foot-tall mud bath renowned for its therapeutic qualities. \nLocal legend says the site, about 45 minutes outside Cartagena, was once a real, active volcano until a quick-thinking priest intervened. \nArmed with holy water, the cleric tamed the fiery mount and transformed the molten lava into a soupy concoction of body-benefiting minerals.\nToday, a sign at the base of the volcano prominently lists the mud's all-natural ingredients: calcium, magnesium and aluminum, among others. \nThe implication is clear -- this isn't just regular dirt; this stuff is good for you. \nFloating in mud\nAs I sized up the crater before me, a man stained slate gray\n \nfrom his volcano attendant duties motioned for me to join him in the murky pool.\nI initially thought the mud would be thick and dense. \nInstead of being sucked into a vat of thick slop, however, I was surprised to find myself floating effortlessly, somehow buoyed by the thin, silk-like sediment. \nOnce inside the volcano, the attendants slathered mud on every inch of our bodies. \nCautiously leaning me back, a guide dipped my head into the mud as if baptizing me into some clay-worshipping cult. \nThis was followed with a quick \"massage\" -- a one-minute or so prodding that was generally relaxing despite its inelegant execution.\nAs more people entered the pool, the attendants repositioned our floating bodies, arranging us like competing oil tankers waiting to pass through a canal. \nAt about 15 feet in diameter, however, the volcano soon reached capacity. \nAs I moved to climb the slippery ladder leading out of the pit, a girl let out a massive scream and frantically paddled away from my direction.\n\"Frog!\" she yelled, waving her arms as if dodging a cobra. \nThe crowd followed her panicked lead, pushing toward the corner farthest from the amphibian.\nWatch your shorts!\nOutside the volcano, the guide told us that we'd rinse off in the nearby river and, if needed, a group of local women would be there to help.\nWalking with two female travelers I'd met on the morning bus ride, I made my way down the path to the river.\n At the end of the trail, a trio of women greeted us and guided the group into the water. \nAfter a few minutes of furious scrubbing, the woman paused and looked down at me. \n\"Take off your shorts,\" she said to me in practiced English. \n\"What?\" I asked.\n\"Shorts. Take them off.\"  \nConscious of my newfound neighbors and the few feet of clear water that separated us, I politely refused, shaking my bottom half in the water to somehow convey that I was as clean as could be.  \nConfident in my physical communication skills, I stood and thanked the woman. \nAs I began to step away though, she grabbed the top of my swim trunks and pulled them out and down. \nI stood frozen as the woman smiled and dished water onto my nether regions. \nLuckily, I was facing toward the riverbank and away from the two bathers I'd met an hour or so earlier. \nAfter seeing for herself that no mud remained, the woman released my shorts, and the elastic band snapped back into place. \nThankfully, I didn't lose anything in the volcano, as the guide had initially warned. \nThe river was another story. \nThere, on a sandy beach in northern Colombia, a little bit of my modesty disappeared into the currents of the crystal clear water.\nIf you go ... \nEl Totumo is a relatively quick 45-minute bus ride from Cartagena's Old City. \nThe entrance fee and transportation to/from should run around $20 per person. \nYour best bet is to arrange your visit through a local hotel or hostel such as El Viajero Hostel. \nYou don't need to be a guest to take advantage of its budget-friendly prices. \nExpect to tip the locals $1 each for their services while visiting the volcano.   ", "8 dazzling reasons to visit Senegal": "And that's a shame for the tourists, who are missing out on vibrant and welcoming Senegal, where rich traditions and natural beauty combine to great effect.\nFrench travelers have been enjoying Senegal's sandy beaches and textured landscapes since the 1970s. \nWhile basic French will come in handy, there are English-speaking guides in most places.\nThe country is seen as a model for democracy and stability in the region, and with its peaceful and hospitable culture, it's an ideal choice for a first-time visitor to Africa. \nHere are eight great reasons to visit.\nBeautiful beaches\nWith 330 miles (531 kilometers) of dazzling Atlantic coastline, Senegal has plenty of opportunities for uninterrupted sun lounging within easy distance of the capital. \nStretching south from Dakar, the Petite Cote is a sweep of buzzing coastal towns, dozing fishing villages and idyllic beaches. \nSaly is Senegal's beach-vacation hub, but its crowds are best avoided by heading to \nTama Lodge\n, a boutique hotel on the edge of neighboring Mbour.  \nThe lodge's restaurant serves a fresh menu of local produce and its cabins are just feet away from a superb curve of palm-studded beach. \nFrom the comfort of its sun loungers, visitors can sip from a fresh coconut and spy muscled Senegalese wrestlers practicing \"la lutte\" -- the country's national sport.\nThe bohemian village of Toubab Dialaw, just an hour south of Dakar, has a pristine beach and a lively arts scene. \nThe mosaicked \nSobo Bade \nhotel offers traditional art, dance and percussion classes to shake up vacation languor.\nTranquillity\nJust south of the Petite Cote, a journey into Sine Saloum's labyrinth of mangrove creeks and lost-in-time fishing villages offers a stress-banishing taste of the simple life. \nOne of the best places to feel the region's calm is Mar Lodj, a small, car-free island in the Saloum delta where the electricity cuts at 11 p.m. to expose an unfettered explosion of stars. \nThese winding creeks are home to an abundance of flora and fauna, protected by 76,000 hectares of national park and UNESCO world heritage status. \nWooden canoe trips glide past flamingos, pelicans and oystercatchers, while the Isle de Oiseaux is home to the largest breeding colony of royal terns in the world. \nHotels can arrange day trips into the delta, starting from about $40 per boat. \nTranquility seekers will love the remoteness of \nHakuna Matata\n, a laid back camp overlooking a glorious stretch of river. \nThis is an angler's paradise -- just seconds after casting off, hungry carp and grouper tug the line.\nFrench host Olivier Guerin helms the camp, plying his guests with fresh seafood at his convivial table d'hote. \n\"We've sort of fallen in love with the place,\" said Daphne, a Belgian expat traveling with her husband and son from Dakar. \"We can't stop coming back.\" \nA vibrant capital\nIn stark contrast to Saloum, bustling Dakar shakes your senses with a warm, salty blast of humidity as soon as you get off the plane. \nDakar is home to the trendy and traditional, Senegal's old and new. It's a fascinating city for dancing, bargain-hunting and authentic culture. \nIn the relaxed neighborhood of Mamelles, La Calebasse is a good spot to sample traditional African cuisine on an elegant covered rooftop. \nFor a buzzier (and smokier) vibe, Le Viking hosts a nightly live band that plays a mix of local \"mbalax\" dance music, Western rock and reggae.\nShoppers at the HLM market can find technicolor prints from $1.50 a meter, and tailored outfits are sewn up in hours. \nMeanwhile the historic Marche Kermel is a literal and visual feast -- the circular wrought-iron building is a kaleidoscope of okra, tamarind and fish.\nEasy-to-reach islands \nJust a 20-minute ferry ride from Dakar, the quiet, picturesque streets of\n Ile de Gor\u00e9e\n hide its horrific past -- it was the last glimpse of Africa for thousands forced from the region as slaves. \nStill standing, the 18th century prison's \"door of no return\" bears witness to this chilling chapter of history.\nThen there's the jagged, uninhabited Isles de la Madeleine national park, which can be reached with a $9 boat ride from Dakar's southwestern bay. \nIt's a find, says Senegalese artist Mamadou Wane. \"Not one percent of the population has been there. \n\"It has crazy beautiful beaches, with rocky cliffs and clear water. Many people here have no idea how beautiful their own country is.\"\nWarm hospitality\nA deep source of pride for its people and a treat for visitors, Senegal's \"teranga,\" or hospitality, is part of its identity.\nFriendly locals are quick to invite visitors for Senegalese tea -- a strong infusion of green tea leaves with mint and sugar brewed over glowing coals. \nIn an elaborate ritual known as \n\"attaya,\" \nthe tea is always brewed in three rounds; the first strong and bitter, the second weaker and the third, very sugary. \nThere are all sorts of different folkloric explanations as to why, with one musician explaining, \"The first is bitter like death, the second is soft like love and the third is sweet like friendship.\"\nMany locals will double as guides within markets or cities, sharing priceless insider knowledge. \nWhile offered freely, a tip is expected, and as with all prices, bartering is the norm.\nA colonial capital\nDripping in history and charm, Saint-Louis was the colonial capital of the whole of French West Africa until Dakar usurped it in 1902, largely thanks to its superior port and growing peanut trade.  \nEasily explored on foot, the city's bougainvillea-laced streets offer the perfect antidote to Dakar in size, pace and atmosphere. \nA stay at the nostalgic \nHotel de la Poste \nevokes the glamorous story of Aeropostale, the French aviation company that pioneered first air-mail, and then in the 1920s, some of the first long-haul passenger flights to Africa and South America. \nGuests can stay in the (modernized) room of legendary pilot Jean Mermoz, a hero in the city.\nA 20-minute drive and boat ride to the Langue de Barbarie peninsula is rewarded with a sandy beach shared only with some rapidly retreating crabs. \nEn route, local women can be seen sifting white salt mounds from tidal ponds, deftly balancing baskets on their heads.\nAmazing sound \nWhether it's the rattling rhythms of mbalax, gentle kora or deep djembe, there's live music to be found every night in and beyond Senegal's capital. \nRenowned Senegalese musician Baaba Maal hosts a world music festival in December, while Saint-Louis welcomes five days of jazz artists in May. \nJust4U is one of the best-known venues for stumbling across top African artists in Dakar, and on Saturdays night-owls should try Thiossane (\nRue 10, Dakar\n), the club of home-grown superstar Youssou N'Dour. \nFish, fish and fish\nSenegal is a treat for seafood lovers -- fish is the country's staple and most menus are peppered with oysters, prawns and squid. \nThe national dish, thieboudienne, marries freshly grilled fish with spicy tomato rice, cassava and carrots. \nIt's served up at Dakar's Chez Loutcha, a favorite for locals.\nAt Mbour, it's well worth heading to the docks at 5 p.m. to spot the arrival of the fishing boats -- dozens of ornately painted vessels bringing in the daily catch. \nAs fishing is one of the country's major industries, hundreds of Senegalese gather to play their part in the riot of color, sounds and of course, smells, central to the whole operation. \n ", "Architectural wonders made entirely from Lego": "Chicago's

", "A happy kingdom at risk of change": "", "Air rage triggered by walking past first-class, study says": "A new study suggests an unexpected trigger for these rare cases of air rage. It found that passengers in economy seating were 3.84 times more likely to have an incident of air rage if they were on a plane that had a first-class section. They were 2.18 times more likely to have an outburst if they had to walk through first class to board the plane, as opposed to boarding in the middle of the plane, directly into the economy section.\n\"Psychology (research) tells us that when people feel a sense of deprivation and inequality, they are more likely to act out,\" said Katherine A. DeCelles, associate professor of organizational behavior at the University of Toronto. DeCelles is the lead author of the study, which was \npublished on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n.\nPassengers are probably not even consciously aware of the deprivation and inequality, and how much it is stressing them out, DeCelles said. However, she and her colleague were not able to talk with the enraged passengers to get a better idea what set them off.\nThere was also a nearly 12-fold increase in the rate of air rage among first-class passengers on flights where all passengers boarded through the first-class section, compared with flights that had separate entrances for first class and economy.\n\"When people from higher social class backgrounds are more aware of their higher status, they are more likely to be antisocial, to have entitled attitudes and to be less compassionate,\" DeCelles said.\nThe researchers looked at a database from a large international airline that collected information on air rage during several recent years. DeCelles and her colleague could not reveal the identity of the airline or specify the years or exact number of air rage cases because it could be used to identify the airline.  \nOverall, cases of air rage were rare. For every 1,000 flights on planes with a first-class section, there were 1.58 incidents of air rage in economy and 0.31 in first class, adding up to a total of a few thousand cases of air rage during the several-year period. However, flight crews might not have reported every case of air rage, so the real number could be higher, DeCelles said.\nFlight crews categorize air rage in one of several types: belligerent behavior, emotional outburst, noncompliant behavior, and incidents involving drugs, alcohol, smoking or sex. The researchers found that belligerent behavior, such as an expression of anger, and intoxication were more common in first class, whereas emotional outbursts, such as a panic attack, were more common among economy passengers. \nIs air rage on the rise?\nAccording to news reports, \nthe rate of air rage has been on the rise\n in recent years. But confirming the rise, and putting numbers on it, is tricky because the Federal Aviation Administration, which tracks this information, \ndoes not require\n flight crew to report air rage. The airline DeCelles studied did show a significant increase in reports of air rage over the years they investigated.\nOf all the indignities of air travel, the crowds and tiny seats in coach take \nmost of the blame\n for inciting air rage among travelers. Yet in the current study, DeCelles said, the presence of first-class seating was a better predictor of air rage than the more notorious hassles of flight delays or having scant room between you and the seat in front of you. And the researchers found the nearly fourfold increase in air rage cases after controlling for other factors such as small seats, flight delays and longer flights.\n\"It could be a ceiling effect (with the small seats),\" DeCelles said. \"You are already feeling super cramped and that extra half-inch is not going to make that much of a difference.\"\nIs first class really to blame?\nAlthough the presence of first-class seating could predict air rage, it is not clear from this study if it is actually contributing to this behavior, said Michael McCullough, professor of psychology at University of Miami. \n\"There could be another thousand things associated with the presence of first-class seating\" that are piquing air rage, said McCullough, who was not involved in the study. For example, even though the researchers took into account the size of the economy cabin, there could be features of planes that do not have a first-class section that make people feel less pressure and less like they are being treated like cattle, he added.\n\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. (This study) is provocative, but it does not strike me as an open and shut case,\" McCullough said. If the researchers are actually right that the presence of first class, or having passengers walk through first class, contributes to the risk of air rage, \"someone ought to insist we change the way we structure planes ... some of these incidents really are public hazards,\" he said. \nIn extreme cases, flights have to be diverted or law enforcement has to be called onto the aircraft to handle an unruly passenger.\nIt could be possible to have more planes load passengers in both the middle and front of the aircraft so travelers do not see passengers in the other section, DeCelles said. \"Most aircraft do have doors in the middle, from what I am told from airline executives,\" she said. The bigger issue is whether the airport has the capability of attaching two jetways to the plane.\nIn addition to reducing the incidence of air rage, boarding at the front and middle of the plane could probably also make the entire process of boarding go faster, DeCelles said.", "This is the world's fastest growing tourism market": "Island sojourns are in high demand, hotels in the region are getting deluxe upgrades and airlines are opening more routes connecting the world to the Caribbean -- all of which has made for tourism growth that's outshining the rest of the world's. \nThe Caribbean opened its arms to 7% more tourists last year, growth that was higher than every other region, and nearly double the 4.4% global average tourism growth in 2015, according to the World Tourism Organization.\nSo why are more folks flocking to the tropics?\nMostly because more people have more money to play with now that the global economy is getting itself in order. \nAnd because air capacity hit a well-timed growth spurt.\nJet Blue was the Caribbean's biggest fan, adding flights from the U.S. to Curacao, Grenada and Barbados, with plans to open up flights from Fort Lauderdale to the Bahamas in August. \nDelta increased air capacity to Belize and St. Croix, and Alitalia added flights from Milan to Antigua & Barbuda.\nThe super dollar helped encourage Americans to pack their flip-flops and sarongs for island getaways, with visits growing 6.3% to 14.3 million, or roughly half of all trips to the Caribbean last year. \nEurope saw seven-year high growth with 4.2% more people taking their euros to the islands. Intra-Caribbean travel hit a high, too, as 11.4% more Caribbean travelers spent the year checking out neighboring countries.\nStats aside, Caribbean tourism is up because people just want to escape the general global disquietude.\n\"The Caribbean is considered a zone of tranquility; that is particularly appealing when there are issues overseas,\" Hugh Riley, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, offered. \nThe region has also tapped into its air of romance. \n\"We suspect that declaring 2016 'The Year of Romance in the Caribbean' has attracted some very favorable response,\" Riley added.\nRomance or otherwise, a sunny set of Caribbean countries is courting the world's jetsetters. \nBarbados, Cuba, Cura\u00e7ao, Haiti, Suriname and Trinidad & Tobago saw some of the greatest tourism growth in 2015, and Belize is coming into its own as a hotspot.\nThese seven isles are 2016's \"it\" destinations, and where many will want to be next time they swap their desk for the beach.\nFor all-to-yourself beaches: Tobago\nWhen basking in the beauty of beaches, the biggest problem, after choosing which swimwear to sport, might be where to find secluded shores. \nIn Tobago, the 25-mile-long sister island of Trinidad, beaches are unspoilt and still unencumbered by crowds. \nAt Englishman's Bay, visitors will have a half-mile of palm-lined sand to themselves, and at Pirate's Bay a 157-step descent leads to crystal-clear waters many don't know are there. \nJemma's Seaview Kitchen, built into a tree on the beach in Speyside, serves up homegrown favorites like king fish and callaloo. \nFor adventure: Cura\u00e7ao\nFor visitors ready to go from the water's edge to its depths, Curacao offers up some of the Caribbean's best below-the-sea exploits. \nThanks to a bubble-like mini submarine, non-divers can get close with the Dutch island's coral reefs and the colorful inhabitants 500-feet below shore. \nSubstation Curacao\n mans the cute submersible, called Curasub, taking regular people wearing regular clothes under the sea, and even on night \"dives\" for those feeling extra intrepid. The sub departs near the Curacao Sea Aquarium in Willemstad.\nFor swimming and sunning: Barbados\nBarbados rarely gets left off of best beach lists -- the island's Crane Beach has regularly been ranked among the 10 best beaches in the world. \nBut there are 59 others if that one somehow doesn't suit. \nThen there's the flying fish.\nThey're not hard to find since the flying fish is a national symbol of Barbados. \nThe one to try comes in a sandwich, called a cutter, from Cuz's Fish Stand in Bridgetown, an unassuming beach shack with rave reviews and a perpetual line.\nFor going beyond the beach: Belize's jungle\nBelize is more than beaches, it's got mountains and jungles and waterfalls too. \nUp in the Maya Mountains at the edge of the island's Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve, there's a 16-cabana ecotourism gem, \nGaia Riverlodge\n, that peeks over a waterfall and a river that powers it. \nInside, indigenous Belizean hardwood adorns private, thatched-roof rooms where names like \"Sun\" and \"Cascade\" sub for numbers and the chef makes staples like fish serre with organic ingredients from Gaia's garden. \nBeyond the lodge, at Barton Creek Caves, visitors can kayak into an archaeological wonder where ancient Maya called on rain gods as early as 200 A.D.\nFor being at one with nature: Suriname\nSuriname is on an upswing as a tourist destination, meaning going now puts travelers ahead of the influx and makes for a dialed-back break. \nThere's hopping a mini plane to plunge into the interior of virgin rainforest.\nOr scaling the Voltzberg dome accompanied by eight species of monkeys for panoramic tropical vistas.\nAnd looking for giant leatherback turtles at Galibi Nature Reserve.\nEither way, visitors are unlikely to see much of their hotel room.\nFor colonial relics: Cuba\nIt's possible to land in Cuba without any plans and still have the most memorable trip of your life. \nNow that travel restrictions are easing for many, dreams of strolling the storied cobblestone streets of Trinidad on the island's southern coast can come true. \nThe town's Spanish Colonial architecture has remained startlingly unchanged since the 19th-century sugar boom, with its pastel hues and ornate ironwork. \nWhen night falls, the salsa rhythms heat up at Casa de la Musica, a live music street dance under the stars.\nFor private grottos: Haiti\nHaiti has emerged as a big-time travel destination and the island's best lure is Bassins Bleu near Jacmel in southern Haiti. \nAs with most gems, the hidden Haitian trio of blue water basins can be tricky to find, but once travelers have hiked the hike, dropped a straw into a refreshing hacked-open coconut  and descended the rope to get to the pools, they might have the grotto all to themselves. \nAdventurers have been known to jump from the waterfalls that fill the pools, but Bassins Bleu has a daily visitor limit to protect its perfection, so it's best to plan ahead.", "World's best chefs descend on Manila": "Sharing space with passengers, raw materials, porcelain and silk were an array of never-before-seen ingredients to surprise -- and doubtless bewilder -- foreign palates on both sides of the Pacific.\nTo mark the 450th anniversary of this early culinary globalization, the Philippines capital recently played host to the second installment of Madrid Fusion Manila. \nThis year's edition of the annual culinary congress, held in mid-April, united some of the world's most celebrated chefs, unexpected ingredients and passionate food fans for three days of meeting and eating, presentations and demonstrations. \nHere are eight of the biggest highlights and takeaways from this year's event. \n1. Chef Joan Roca? Still the king \nBy pretty much every barometer, there's currently no better or more important chef on the face of the planet than Catalan genius Joan Roca. \nOne third of the brothers behind \nEl Celler de Can Roca\n, located in a working-class suburb of Girona, north of Barcelona, the affable eldest son in the family brought serious culinary star power to Manila. \nWith three Michelin stars to his name and holder of the top spot in the \"\nWorld's 50 Best Restaurants\n\" list, accolades don't come higher. \nOne highlight of his Manila demonstration was an extraordinary creation of cotton candy, made to look like wool by using techniques including centrifuges and a rotary evaporator. \nHe completes the dish with extract of sheep's wool essence, before carefully placing it atop ice cream made from Catalan sheep's milk. \nBizarre and brilliant.\n2. Lechon is highly underrated\nFilipinos love to discuss food almost as much as eating it -- and that includes debate over the country's national dish. \nWhile many would say it's adobo -- slow-cooked braised pork and chicken in a mix of vinegar, spices and soy sauce -- others, especially outside the capital, would suggest roast suckling pig, otherwise known as lechon. \nBack in 2008 Anthony Bourdain famously declared it the \"best pig ever\" and, after one taste, it's clear why. \nAt Madrid Fusion Manila, the humble pig on a spit was taken to new heights by\n \"Lechon Diva'\" Dedet de la Fuente\n. \nThe chef behind Manila restaurant Pepita's Kitchen stuffs the pig with multiple ingredients including truffle rice and the brilliantly decadent paella of chorizo and crab fat, known locally as aligue.\nPepita's Kitchen, Magallanes Ave, Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines; +63 2 425 4605\n3. Narisawa deserves every bit of hype \nJapanese superstar Yoshihiro Narisawa was another legendary chef on hand at Madrid Fusion Manila. \nOwner of eponymous restaurant Narisawa, the sublimely talented Aichi native has helped to pioneer sustainable gastronomy, emphasizing the critical connection between cuisine and preservation of the natural environment. \nDishes such as \"essence of the forest\" and \"soil soup\" support his kitchen philosophy, while he wowed Manila audiences by preparing multiple dishes featuring spring cherry blossoms -- sakura. \nHis dessert \"sakura and rice\" featured sakura honey, flowers and jelly under fresh sakura leaves. \n4. Chef collaborations are here to stay\nLucky diners had an array of world-class dining options to choose from during the congress thanks to Gallery Vask. \nHelmed by Spanish chef Jose \"Chele\" Gonzalez, the chic restaurant hosted a number of collaboration dinners throughout the week, highlighting a continuing global trend. \nMost notable amongst them was a \"\nsix-hands dinner\n\" of three chefs, featuring Narisawa, Gonzalez and Peruvian super chef Virgilio Martinez. \nStandout dishes included Narisawa's breathtaking \"Tokyo ceviche\" of local Filipino fish with yuzu and kombu, while Martinez imported ingredients from Peru including edible clay and lucuma fruit, making for a remarkable, unusual and beautiful dessert. \n5. The chef we all want to work for? Leah Cohen\nWith a Filipina mother and Russian-Romanian father, Leah Cohen's background bridges the world in tandem with her unique plates. \nA graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, the New York-based chef has won critical and public acclaim for the bold Southeast Asian street food flavors served at her restaurant \nPig and Khao\n. \nVoted best Asian restaurant in New York by Zagat, it features a number of Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino dishes on the menu, including her unique take on adobo. \nShe demonstrated it to the Congress crowd, using fried quail in place of the traditional chicken or pork, with the unusual addition of Szechuan peppercorns. \nBy the end of the session she had a line of people wanting to work for her.\n6. Souring agents \nWhile last year's Madrid Manila Fusion was all about the \ndubious appeal of tuna sperm\n, this year it was souring agents at the fore. \nA constant and critical component of Filipino cuisine, they have continued to grow in appeal and now appear on menus at some of the world's top restaurants.\nA favorite Filipino dish, sinigang is a sour and tangy soup known for incorporating souring agents such as green unripe mango, batwan fruit, tamarind or calamansi, all of which were praised and mentioned by international chefs throughout the congress. \nThe prize for the ultimate sour Filipino ingredient goes to\n kamias\n, a soft yellow-green fruit that will have you puckering up in no time. \n7. Reinterpreted Mexican\nFollowing star names from Spain and Japan came a Mexico City-based chef who's swiftly become the global face of contemporary Mexican cuisine. \nChef Jorge Vallejo dropped out of high school and took a job as a dishwasher, little knowing the culinary future that would lie ahead. \nHe won plenty of fans in the room by expressing his affection for the Philippines after working alongside Filipinos in kitchens on global cruise lines. \nThereafter he worked for Enrique Olvera in Mexico City before opening \nQuintonil\n alongside his wife in 2012, now famed for its reinterpreted Mexican home cooking. \nThis was his first visit to the Philippines.\n\"I arrived very early and the city was already full of life at 5 a.m. -- I realized that this is Mexico! This is Acapulco! You see the faces of the people are for sure Asian, but there's still a similarity with the Mexican people,\" he said. \n\"I realized that even now, the idea of the Manila Galleon still has an impact, there is still a lot in common here with Mexico. We're also both crazy about chicharron pork crackling!\"  \n8. Global dishes, Filipino ingredients \nBritish chef Nurdin Topham, from Hong Kong restaurant \nNur\n, was among several chefs to hype Filipino produce. \nHis take on the English classic of strawberries and cream used only locally sourced ingredients. \nFour-week-old fermented buffalo yoghurt with cultured cream was mixed with essential oil from roses and geraniums, before joining rare, end-of-season Filipino strawberries. \nAcross numerous presentations during the congress, multiple ingredients that seem staples of one culture's cooking were revealed as originally coming from another. \nSo next time you're chowing down on Mexican mole, remember that it wouldn't be the same without cinnamon, a plant that didn't exist in Mexico until it was imported via galleons all those centuries ago.", "Heavy drinking in Tbilisi, Georgia": "", "Chinese park turns abandoned buses into Hello Kitty, Mickey Mouse hotels": "Owners of the Tai Tai Mountain Park in the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, have converted more than 30 old buses into mini-hotels featuring private kitchens, bathrooms and colorful interior and exterior designs.\nEach bus hotel has its own theme, mainly popular cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse, Hello Kitty and Doraemon.\nCartoon murals adorn the exteriors, while bright bedspreads, novelty dishware and big stuffed animals help bring the insides to life.\nGuolin Han, president of the Tai Tai Mountain Park, explained why he decided the buses were the way to go.\n\"These abandoned buses are cheap to buy and it's great reuse of waste,\" said Han.\nHe said they spent more than $9,000 to transform each bus.\nMore buses coming, says owner\nThe resort charges customers $43 a night to stay in the mini-hotels and is targeting couples and families.\nSince opening in May business has been steady, especially on weekends.

Eventually the water meets in a perfect circle, back where you began. Everything is as it should be. You're a resident of a Bernal Sphere, floating on the far side of the Moon -- you're used to the artificial gravity by now.\nAs retrofuturist artwork goes, few reach the outlandish heights of Rick Guidice and Don Davis, commissioned by NASA in 1975 to illustrate potential space colonies. \nThe designs sprang from the mind of a team at the NASA Ames Research Center, spearheaded by Gerard O'Neill, a Princeton professor given grants by the American space program to conduct a \nten week study\n into off-world structures. \nWorking with architects, researchers, engineers and scientists in Mountain View, California, O'Neill assessed whether his ideas were feasible, eventually drawing up three concepts to present to NASA: the Bernal Sphere, the Toroidal Colony and the Cylindrical Colony.\nEach used centrifugal force to generate artificial gravity, reflected in their circular designs and vast solar arrays to power their rotation. Inside verdant landscapes offered comfortable living in Modernist homes. \nBauhaus structures popped up among lakes and forests; elsewhere whitewashed villas and terracotta patios brought Ionian charm to the cold vacuum of space.\nThe largest concept, the Cylindrical Colony, had the potential to hold a million people at a time. For all intents and purposes, they were like Earth -- only turned inside out. O'Neill speculated that with the right technological developments, construction could begin as soon as 1990.\nTo view the designs with skepticism is to forget the milieu in which they were created: the last manned mission to the Moon was three years previous and Skylab, the United States' first space station, was orbiting Earth. The space shuttle program, a giant leap which promised so much, was only around the corner. \nThe progress of mankind's space programs must have been a crushing disappointment for O'Neill, who died in 1992. He aimed for lush vistas, but in truth we've only just learned \nhow to cultivate lettuce\n.

Instead, it makes the clever device which can be attached to drones to scan barcodes. \nThe device uses lasers and details of the warehouse's dimensions to navigate the drone. By measuring its distance from the ground and walls, it calculates the drone's position. \nEvery time it scans a barcode, it automatically updates the central log with the exact location of that product.\nThe Drone Scan is attached to a DJI Matrice, which -- as opposed to more \"easy on the eyes\" consumer products -- is designed for commercial use and can be customized and controlled externally.\nJasper Pons, co-founder of Drone Scan, says this technology will save large companies millions of dollars every month by cutting man hours during stock-takes. \nThe drone can also fly up to the harder-to-reach higher shelves.\n\"We think the workers are going to love them,\" says Pons. \"They are going to say: 'Give us the drones and give us back our weekends.'\"\nFishing for gold \nThe idea for Drone Scan came after co-founder Jasper Pons started using a homemade drone to map fishing sites and film a canoe race on the Msunduzi river near Pietermaritzburg, in South Africa    \n\"I thought, if this thing can lift a camera it can lift a barcode scanner up in a warehouse,\" says Pons.\nHaving worked with warehouse software in the past, the drone was a logical step towards speeding up data collection for Pons.\nThe company, which was founded in 2013, has since landed a pilot project in Europe.\nCo-founder Craig Leppan cannot disclose the client's name, but says it is a large multinational company. \n\"They've indicated they have over 400 warehouses worldwide in need of this solution.\"\nCould change warehouse design \n\"Continuous inventory is almost a dream within warehouse logistics,\" says Leppan. \"Eventually you will have the drones working away in the warehouses at night when everybody is asleep.\"\nThe technology has potential to improve efficiency for large delivery giants such as Amazon. \"The drone will help make their system more accurate which means less time spent looking for stuff when it's needed,\" says Pons.\nWhile these drones may be the ideal workers -- they don't complain or need weekends off -- they do need their batteries recharging, a limitation to the technology the team is currently working on.

In 2015, 40 players on the PGA Tour recorded an average of more than 300 yards, with the leader Dustin Johnson at 317.7 yards.\n\"The clubs are indisputably better,\" former Golf.com managing editor Eamon Lynch told CNN. \n\"But no one is more willing to believe in the promise of a technologically advanced, store-bought solution than a golfer with a crappy swing.\"\nIncremental\nSo what's next? Manufacturers have differing views on where their focus should be, with moveable weights, face technology, head shape and weight all key battlegrounds.\nMost seem to agree that a club's center of gravity -- which affects launch, spin, feel and ultimately distance -- is the priority in the next few years.\n\"Some companies spend a lot of time talking about aerodynamics but we see that as a very small gain because club heads are already pretty aerodynamic,\" Cobra Puma's Olsavsky says.\nREAD: Musical golfer on Brazil's party people\n\"We believe the trend is low and further-back center gravity (CG). Better use of materials, investing in carbon fiber crowns and improved CG is where the industry is headed.\"\nWhether the gains will be incremental, or whether there will be another big leap forward, depends on your time frame.\n\"If you buy a driver every year, yes, you would see more incremental changes than innovative,\" Olsavsky adds.\n\"If you don't buy a driver very often -- say every four, five or six years -- the change will be pretty revolutionary and you will notice a big difference.\"\nFor the pros used to switching in and out of the best equipment, marginal gains are important.\n\"Callaway only bring products to me when they know it's going to perform better than what I've got at the minute,\" Willett told a Callaway prodcast. \n\"I did  a lot of testing with the XR driver at home over the winter and put it in the bag right away. It did exactly what they said it would for my game. It gave me more ball speed and control of my ball flight and it was a win-win.\"  \n \nREAD: Is the Players Championship really the fifth major?\nNot all amateur golfers are convinced.\n\"If they kept adding an extra five yards every time, we'd all be hitting it 350 yards by now,\" says Ed Light, an eight-handicap golfer from Cranleigh in Surrey, England. \"For the price of a new one these days, I tend to think the money's better invested in good quality lessons.\"\nNick Russell, a member at Surrey's Walton Heath club, added: \"I think technology has helped, but it's not distance I'm looking for as modern clubs and balls all go a long way; it's forgiveness, with a club that sits well and is pleasing to the eye.\n\"I am maybe 10 yards longer now than 10 years ago, probably due to technology, but I arguably swing it a bit better too so it's hard to judge.\"\nREAD: Jordan Spieth's Masters disaster -- the ultimate choke?\nThe elephant in the room in terms of distance is ball technology.\nSimilar amounts of R&D time and money have taken the ball from a hair or feather-filled leather orb to a sleek, dimpled urethane-covered missile.\nBut many, including Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, believe ball development should be reined back to ensure courses are not made obsolete by players hitting longer.\nThe club makers, however, will continue pushing the envelope.

As Will Oremus \npointed out\n in Slate, that would be bad for business: people think much more favorably of technology companies than they do of the Fourth Estate. So it should come as no surprise that in reacting to the scandal Facebook seems desperate to avoid looking like a news agency. It stands, according to VP Justin Osofsky, for \"a free flow of ideas and culture across nations.\" \nThis is a lovely sentiment, and I'm sure many people who work at Facebook and use the platform believe in it. But it's not what Facebook does. We know this for two reasons. First, imagine if the company took that credo at face value. \nA truly democratic network where the most popular content wins would be filled with cute pet videos, ice bucket challenges and, one presumes, vast troves of porn. The company got a wake-up call about this problem during the Ferguson tragedy in 2014, when \nits algorithms did a poor job\n of sharing news coverage of that story.\nIts response? Hire a bunch of contractors, most of them just starting out in journalism, and stick them in a temporary conference room that might as well have been labeled \"Black Box.\" \nThe\n recently leaked guidelines\n (published by The Guardian) those contractors followed suggest just how deeply the company's algorithmic logic permeated even this effort to put humans back in the loop: the detailed instructions read like they began life as a flowchart that someone translated into memo form.\nIronically, those guidelines reveal just how circular the online news business has become. The memo instructed contractors to track just 10 news sites, including CNN, the BBC, Fox News and The Guardian, in evaluating whether a story merits \"national\" importance. Meanwhile, editors at all of those places closely monitor Facebook (which, remember, is not a news organization) to see what news is getting traction with the digital public. News directors trying to decipher the Trending Topics algorithm were really peering into an editorial funhouse mirror.\nThis brings us to the second reason the free-flow dream is not happening anytime soon. Facebook really is a company built around a set of algorithms, just like Google, Amazon and many others. The news feed algorithm decides what posts and news items Facebook's 1.6 billion daily users see -- and then there are the algorithms serving up $17 billion worth of ads. \nWhat's really interesting about the Facebook controversy is how it highlights the quiet sea change that algorithms have caused in all sorts of digital contexts. I like to think of this as the fa\u00e7ade of computation: we're all so desperate to believe in the magic of the algorithm that we bend over backward to make it seem real.  \nSometimes it seems like people are more patient with their smartphones than they are with their children. We all use a special voice talking to the airline reservation system. And when the magic works, we're delighted even if we had to cheat a little to make it happen. \nSo when the fa\u00e7ade crumbles and we awkwardly confront the humans toiling away inside the machine, everyone is disappointed and sometimes even angry. But what we need to realize that algorithms are always implemented in the world -- there are engineers, workarounds, bugs and a thousand other course corrections that have to happen before an elegant piece of code can really start doing work in the messy, ambiguous space of culture. \nThe interesting question becomes why we're so desperate to outsource fairness and objectivity to our algorithms -- why it could possibly be easier to program it deep inside some black box when we so rarely achieve it in full sunlight.\n \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n ", "Rare flight for the biggest plane in the world": "The Ukrainian cargo jet named \"Mriya\" is one of a kind. There is no other. \nThat's why the gawkers showed up Tuesday in Prague. They watched in awe as this big boy defied gravity before it touched down at Vaclav Havel Airport in the Czech Republic. \nOfficially designated as the Antonov An-225, the plane was developed in the 1980s to carry the Soviet version of the space shuttle on its back. \nMORE: The cruise ship that flies at 30,000 feet\nWhen the shuttle program ended, the plane morphed into the world's coolest flying moving van. \nWhile in Prague, workers will load Mriya with a generator weighing 130 tons for delivery to Australia. \nHere's a little perspective on what makes this thing so special. \nWe live in an age when most airliners are powered by two or four jet engines. \nThis monster has six. \nIts wingspan measures 290 feet (88 meters). \nThat's longer than five 53-foot semi-truck trailers set end-to-end. \nMriya's cargo hold is actually longer than the Wright Brothers' historic flight in 1903.  \nIts maximum total weight at takeoff: 640 tons. \nThat's more than twice as heavy as the Statue of Liberty. \nMORE: The world's strangest looking airplane\nRare sight\nTo carry all that weight Mriya has 32 wheels spread across its oversized landing gear. \nThis beauty has other nice features ... like the way its nose opens to allow cargo loading through the front end.

Some people love to be used and abused!\n \n@I_the_Prattler: @secupp <she is the EPITOME of everything that's wrong with the CORRUPT @GOP edifice These #scumbags help to keep in power the corrupt! @CNN\n \nTo be clear, I am a conservative, and these tweets are from other self-described conservatives (or, at the very least, Donald Trump supporters).\n \nAs has become boringly predictable these days, conservatives are mad at other conservatives for being fake conservatives.\n \nIn case you have a life, and haven't cared to invest in the soap-operatic, teenage dramas between certain factions of the conservative movement (in which case, I'm envious), let me give you the basic synopsis:\n \nTrump is the only true conservative, and everyone who opposes him is the \"establishment.\"\n \nQuestioning the Trump orthodoxy (which, incidentally, is rarely intelligible if ever at all conservative) is the thing that now makes a conservative a \"cuckservative,\" a pejorative term to describe a weak, emasculated \"sell out\" to the establishment wing of the party. This now includes conservatives like me, with previously pristine records of right-wing fanaticism, at least as classified by the mainstream press, and ranging from Glenn Beck to the National Review, Ted Cruz to Paul Ryan.\n \nWhat's this got to do with Facebook? A lot, it would seem.\n \nIn this kind of climate, where a lifelong Democrat and former Hillary Clinton donor is now the standard-bearer of authentic conservatism and everyone else a loser and a traitor, creating tribal lines of division is nothing short of a fetish, and one that has spilled over into the Facebook debate.\n \nAfter allegations surfaced that former Facebook contractors suppressed conservative trending topics, the company launched an investigation, promised transparency, and then reached out to several conservative thought leaders and personalities, including myself, to sit down and address these and other concerns with founder Mark Zuckerberg and top members of his executive team.\n \nPresumably, there would be two kinds of responses to this invitation:\n \n\"I accept. This is a disturbing issue and I want to be part of solving the problem.\"\n \nOr, \"I regretfully decline. That's the day of my grandmother's funeral.\"\n \nI'll get back to the importance of attending this meeting in a minute. But first...\n \nI was surprised to learn there is apparently another option, which was to refuse to go, complain that no Trump representatives were invited (they were, one attended), slam Facebook's overture as a \"pat conservatives on the head\" session, blast the people who do attend as \"cucks\" and sit in the corner and sulk.\n \nWhich is what a number of invitees decided, disappointingly.\n \nBreitbart, long in the tank for Trump, said it had no interest in participating in a \"Facebook photo op.\" One headline blared: \"Cucked by Zuck: Establishment Conservatives Rock Up for Pointless Meeting with Facebook,\" already deciding the outcome.\n \nThe American Conservative Union, which oversees the popular CPAC convention every year, issued a statement saying it would not attend, and then listed all of its grievances with Facebook's alleged anti-conservative bias, which included rejecting \"ACU's overtures for Facebook to play a meaningful role at CPAC.\"\n \nOther outlets jumped on the people who did decide to attend, calling them \"conservatives\" in quotes.\n \nDrudge Report: \"Facebook: Anti-Trump 'Conservatives' to Meet with Zuckerberg.\"\n \nFox News' Charles Payne tweeted, \"Mark Zuckerberg to meet w/ 'conservative' leaders.\"\n \nIs the important story that Facebook is meeting with conservatives? Or that it's meeting with \"conservatives\"?\nDistrust predates Trump \nThis is not to suggest all of this is just about Trump. The distrust of Facebook and Silicon Valley among conservatives is real and hardly new. Most of the faces of the tech companies are outspoken liberals. Facebook has in the past had to defend against allegations that conservatives and conservative stories don't get as much reach as liberal stories, or as they do on other social platforms. I understand skepticism. Skepticism is my job.\nI'm also not naive. Of course this was part of a PR strategy for Facebook. You don't publicly invite a group of aggrieved people with large platforms to come to your fabled, sprawling campus and meet with the head honcho if you don't hope they will then go back to their large platforms and spread the good word.\nBut isn't the fact that Facebook considers this a PR problem (as well as an actual problem, I believe) proof that it does not want to be perceived as a liberal organization? If it really didn't care about attracting and retaining conservative users, why would it need damage control? \nAnd if you have genuine concerns about bias and bad actors, don't you take an opportunity to help correct a problem?\nThe bottom line is, staying home solves zero problems. And in fact, it creates one.\nMy reason for attending the meeting was two-fold. One, I am deeply concerned about the effect of bias -- whether intentional or subconscious -- in alienating any group of people based on their beliefs, in this case mine.\nZuckerberg and his team assured us they were investigating that issue, take it very seriously, and do not have any evidence it is systemic. The mission of Facebook is to provide as big a platform to as many people as possible. Subverting voices is anathema to that mission (as well as its business model, more to the point).\nThis is a problem. I hope it is addressed. But I am frankly more concerned about conservatives' long-term relationship with Silicon Valley.\nThe perception that Silicon Valley is liberal exists for a reason. It largely is, but only to the extent that anyone in tech ever gives politics a thought. The tech world's most vocal political voices lean left on social issues, but your average programmer and developer are probably more libertarian than liberal. And when pressed, even your average executive would align more closely with the right on issues that are crucial to their own industry.\nWhy Facebook needs conservatives\nOn issues like security, privacy, regulation and free markets, Silicon Valley has allies in conservative policies, not liberal ones. When I mentioned this in our meeting, there was broad agreement from the Facebook side that liberals have at times been more than just a pain on these issues, they've been a threat to their best interests.\nSilicon Valley, and in particular the share economy leaders, need conservatives on the Hill, on K Street, and in the media to keep their markets free and their products innovative. Tech leaders ignored this simple fact for years, but are finally realizing Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton may share their attitudes on gay marriage, but not regulation. Which matters more to their bottom line?\nBut the questions the Facebook-objectors seem to be asking is, Does conservatism need Facebook and Silicon Valley? Well, only if wants to survive.\nForgetting the fact that Facebook has 1.7 billion users and no one reads books or newspapers on paper anymore, conservatives have been combating the image that they are stuck in the past for, well, as long as there's been a past to be stuck in. Conservatives should be leading the way on innovation, instead of constantly ceding that ground to the \"hipster progressives with their gadgets and watch-phones.\"\nWhy we need Facebook\nInstead of insisting conservatism and Silicon Valley are East and West Berlin, ideologically exclusive and wholly uninterested in one another, both need to acknowledge each other's necessity. I went to this meeting because I want lifelong partnerships in Silicon Valley to connect conservative values and policies with as many people as possible, to make the world work more efficiently, to innovate around government bureaucracy and to empower the private sector.\nAnd I was pleasantly surprised to hear that Facebook wants partnerships with conservatives as well. For that, they will need our trust. And to earn our trust, we will need their respect.\nThis is all a work in progress, and it will take time, open lines of communication and transparency. But progress is impossible when parties decide to stay home.\nI was glad Facebook reached out to us, and would have been just as happy had I not been included. This meeting was a necessary step in the right direction -- toward an alliance between two communities whose shared obsession with free markets could do a lot of good for a lot of people.\n \n  \nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\n ", "Dr. robot could conduct your next surgery": "One step up the technological spectrum is \nartificial intelligence\n, where robots are now making informed decisions based on the tasks they're presented with, highlighted by the burgeoning field of \ndriverless cars\n.\nAs we get used to the idea of machines producing our goods, we're slowly coming around to them making decisions for us, but would you put your life in their hands? More specifically, would you let a robot perform surgery on you? \nChina restaurant debuts robot waiters\nBetter than a human surgeon\nThe idea might scare you, but scientists are making it happen -- and doing it safely -- as shown in a \nrecent study\n by surgeons at \nChildren's National Medical Center\n in Washington.\nThe team showed for the first time that a supervised autonomous robot could perform soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel during open surgery -- and doing so better than a human surgeon.\n\"This smart, intelligent technology will tell you how to (conduct surgery) optimally,\" said Peter Kim, \nassociate surgeon in chief\n at the hospital and project lead on the Smart-Tissue Autonomous Robot, or STAR. \"This is not to replace surgeons tomorrow but provide collective experiences of how things should be done.\" \nKim argues that developing robots in this way can ensure all patients receive the best care, regardless of which surgeon is available when they are in need of it. \"Wouldn't it be nice that whenever or wherever you need surgery, it's done by the best surgeon?\" \nRobot vs. human\nThe use of robots to aid with surgeries is nothing new. Surgeons regularly use devices such as the \nda Vinci Surgical System\n to perform complex procedures, and the robots can help access hard-to-reach tumors or visualize the inside of a patient with minimal invasion. \nStep into operating room from wherever you are\nBut the use of robots purely as aids is what Kim is trying to move beyond. He wants them to outdo the surgeons.\n\"(Current) tools are simple extensions of a human. Unless you make them better, there's no point,\" said Kim, who believes that his robot can be developed to conduct routine parts of a procedure, freeing up surgeons to focus on more challenging aspects. \"The tool will come in at a time and place for maximal function.\"\nHow does it work?\nIn the study, STAR sutured and reconnected bowel segments in a selection of pigs. Results were compared to those of manual surgery, the use of laparoscopes and use of robot assistance with the da Vinci system. On all counts, such as quality and accuracy, STAR came out shining bright.\nThe machine is made up of a robotic arm and surgical tools that use imaging technologies and markers to navigate along  tissue. The visuals further help the robot decide where stitches should be made. \n\"The robot makes the decision of where sutures should go, based on vision and pressure,\" Kim said. \"The precision is within a sub-millimeter range.\"\nRobots are already used to work on hard tissues, such as bone, but the solid structure offers an easier, more stable target for the robot to cut into. Soft tissues are more challenging. \n\"Soft tissue constantly moves, so one major finding (of this) is that we can model soft tissue and follow it,\" Kim said.\nThe team hopes that using robots autonomously will remove human error from the operating room for the 45,000 soft-tissue surgeries estimated to take place in the United States each year. A \nrecent study \nsuggested that medical mistakes might be the \nthird leading cause of death\n in the country.\n\"With other robot technologies, complication rates haven't changed at all,\" Kim said. \niPhone photography is cool, eyeball photography is cooler\nAn ethical challenge\nOne critical question that remains is whether it would be acceptable for robots to be used autonomously in procedures where human life is at stake. \n\"There are ethical issues, such as where lies the responsibility if it is completely automated,\" said \nShafi Ahmed\n, a consultant cancer surgeon at the Royal London Hospital. \nWhen a surgeon should just say 'I'm sorry'\nAhmed is a proponent of the use of technology in surgery, exemplified through his recent \nlive stream of an operation\n in virtual reality, but acknowledges the risks involved in automating procedures.\n\"A surgeon can deal with a complication,\" he said, adding that the ability to adjust when a complication arises is one of the hardest parts of the job. \"Will a robot be able to deal with it?\"\nFor now, Ahmed believes that the use of autonomous robots in only part of an operation, with the surgeon present at all times, alleviates this dilemma. But he also questions why a robot is needed if a surgeon has to be in the room. \"These are the first steps,\" he said.\nThe study was a intended to show that STAR could be an option for surgery. Kim's team now hopes to take the robot into clinical trials and make it more intelligent, with the goal of automating an entire procedure.\n\"It's not a perfect technology. It does make mistakes,\" Kim said. \"But fundamentally, it (will be) safer and accessible to everybody.\"", "Habitat inflated on side of space station": "Scientists fully inflated the experimental habitat called BEAM, which is attached to the International Space Station. The pressurization process began at 4:34 p.m. ET and 10 minutes later, all eight tanks reached full pressurization, \naccording to NASA.\n \nNASA TV called it a \"very successful day.\"\nDuring the next week, NASA will conduct leak checks throughout the BEAM, which stands for Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. If all goes well, astronaut Jeff Williams is expected to make his first entry into the module in about a week.\nBEAM looks like a bulbous, onion-like tent protruding from the space station. \nBut NASA has pinned hopes on expandable equipment such as BEAM because it is lighter and more compact than the metal structures that have been traditionally sent to orbit. Also, the space agency hopes such smaller loads can mean deeper exploration into space. \nAs NASA prepares for its journey to Mars in the 2030s, it's looking for new technology that will help humans go to places they've never traveled to before.\nWhat went wrong during first test\nAstronauts had to retest the module after the\n initial attempt to inflate the module hit a snag Thursday morning. \nThe habitat was supposed to expand to the size of a small bedroom with breathable air, starting its two-year stint in space.\nBut on Thursday, something had gone wrong. Scientists noticed a problem with BEAM when the pressure to volume ratio wasn't adding up.\nAfter analyzing data from the first attempt, the space agency and Bigelow Aerospace believed they identified the problem. \nThe answer was fabric friction, Bigelow engineer Lisa Kauke said.\nWhen BEAM was added to the \nSpaceX Falcon 9 rocket payload\n, it may have been packed up longer than expected, according to Bigelow engineers. \nThe fabric-like material that BEAM is made from was compressed, changing the way the material behaved in space temporarily, making it more rigid during the expansion process during that first test.\n \n\"The impact of the compression affected the layers,\" Kauke said during a teleconference from Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"Layers have a memory to them. The longer they are packed the longer it takes for the materials to relax.\"\nSo NASA and Bigelow Aerospace had decided to stop inflating the habitat on Thursday, just to make sure there was no damage to the space station during the process.\nTheir latest retest on Saturday fully expanded and pressurized BEAM. \nBigelow Aerospace tweeted: \"A significant milestone has been accomplished.\"\nRight now, NASA plans to have astronauts enter BEAM three to four times a year to see how the habitat is faring. They'll have to see how the structure fares against solar radiation and extreme fluctuations in temperature. \nAfter its two-year stint in space, BEAM will jettison back down to Earth, and burn up in our atmosphere.", "Meet the largest unnamed world in our solar system": "A handful have been identified in the last decade thanks to new technology, but many remain a mystery, undiscovered by astronomers. \nHowever, scientists believe they have stumbled upon the largest unnamed world in our solar system after analyzing data from two space observatories, \naccording to a new report by NASA\n.\nThe world, 2007 OR10, is much larger than astronomers previously thought, making it the third largest dwarf planet on a list of half a dozen worlds. Scientists believe there may be thousands of worlds like this in our solar system.\nMany dwarf planets are hard to detect because they look like tiny points of light. It is hard to tell if that light is coming from a small world or a large world. That was one of the challenges of finding 2007 OR10. Although its elliptical orbit brings it as close to our sun as Neptune, the eighth planet in our solar system, 2007 OR10 is twice as far away as Pluto.\nUsing Kepler, NASA's planet-hunting space telescope, and archival data from European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory mission, astronomers were able to revise the size of 2007 OR10. \nThe world has a diameter of 955 miles, making it about one-third Pluto's size, according to findings published in the \nAstronomical Journal in April\n.\n\"Our revised larger size for 2007 OR10 makes it increasingly likely the planet is covered in volatile ices of methane, carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would be easily lost to space by a smaller object,\" said Andr\u00e1s P\u00e1l at Konkoly Observatory in Budapest, Hungary, who led the research. \"It's thrilling to tease out details like this about a distant, new world -- especially since it has such an exceptionally dark and reddish surface for its size.\"\nOne observation scientists have made is that 2007 OR10 is a very dark world, which could give us clues about the early history of our solar system\n\"We think this object is left over from when our sun and solar system first formed,\" NASA scientist Geert Barentsen said. \"It's almost as old as the sun itself.\"\nThe reason 2007 OR10 is so dark is because it's likely frozen material that reflects very little sunlight. Scientists are interested in studying the world in order to learn more about how Earth formed.\n\"It may be one of the darkest dwarf planets in our solar system,\" Barentsen said.\nIt's up to the team of astronomers who discovered 2007 OR10 to give the world a name. Usually dwarf planets are named after a certain characteristic, but astronomers didn't know enough about  2007 OR10 to officially name it until now, according to Meg Schwamb, who was one of the astronomers to identify the world  in 2007 during a survey.\nWith the exception of Ceres, which is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between Mars and Jupiter, almost all other minor planets are floating beyond Neptune.\nThe chances of us reaching 2007 OR10 in our lifetime are slim, especially because it has taken \nscientists about a decade to reach Pluto\n. But we can still learn a lot about this world with our current satellite technology, Barentsen said. ", "The bionic skin that can feel a tumor": "Imagine then a scene where skin could communicate what's going on inside a human body. It could inform surgeons, provide alerts when our body is about to fall ill, or even diagnose diseases inside another human being, simply through the sense of touch.\nUniversity of Tokyo scientist Takao Someya is making that scene a reality.\nSomeya has invented a bionic, or electronic, skin (e-skin) with the potential to bestow amazing new powers of sensitivity upon humans. \nIt is as light as a feather, yet almost indestructible, and could one day change the field of medicine.\nThe future of healthcare?\nSomeya is striving for a future where doctors wearing a bespoke glove made from his technology could detect a tiny tumor hiding inside a woman's breast, simply by feeling it. This would reduce the need for referrals and scans and could potentially detect tumors earlier -- during routine checks. \nThe possibilities are vast.\nThese wearable e-skins, either tattooed onto our bodies or sewn into our clothes, could also be used to monitor our vital signs and even help medics predict future heart attacks, by monitoring our heart signals\n. \nSomeya plans to make this happen within the next few years. \nHowever, this vision of his began with robots -- not humans.\n\"I imagined this futuristic scene where a robot shaking hands with someone could detect their emotion -- like passion, or sorrow.\" Creating e-skins for robots, he thought, would be a new research trend outside the saturated area of more commercial electronics, which at the time either focused on miniaturization or making machines faster.\nThat was 15 years ago.\nToday that vision seems far less futuristic when compared to the technology he has since pioneered. \nGetting under his skin\n\"In the early 2000s, when I started out, flexible electronics were getting popular, but most people were trying to develop e-paper,\" says the professor of electrical engineering. \"I wanted to do something outside the mainstream.\"\nArtificial skins already existed, but they weren't very good. The ones capable of detecting temperature and pressure were not flexible and were instead only rigid electronic materials that had some level of function. They were also too expensive to be manufactured in large enough quantities to cover a robot\n.\n \nSomeya wanted to tackle all of these limitations, but it wouldn't be easy.\nThe human touch \nHuman skin is marvelously complicated -- it is not an easy thing to mimic. \nWhen \"unwrapped,\" the average adult contains roughly \ntwenty square feet of skin\n, with a mind-boggling\n two million pain receptors\n.\nSomeya knew that wiring two million sensors into a circuit driver would kill the flexibility of any e-skin.\nHis desire for flexible skin called for flexible thinking and what Someya did next established him firmly as a visionary in the world of artificial intelligence. \nIn 2003, he began swapping rigid electronic materials -- such as silicon -- with  flexible, organic materials such as dinaphtho thieno thiophene (DNTT), a material often used on the security foil strips found on banknotes.  \nFirstly, he opted to connect sensors, with the ability to detect pressure and temperatures between 30 degrees C to 80 degrees C (86 degrees F to 176 degrees F), with organic semi-conductors that were naturally soft and biocompatible -- the ideal material for e-skin.\nHe then laid these materials on the type of \"active matrix\" grid system traditionally used in LCD displays, enabling each sensor to have an address it could be located at on the grid. This would avoid the need for tangles of wires. \nHe then had one more stroke of genius up his sleeve.\nWhile Someya's peers were placing their sensors on rigid surfaces, such as ultrathin glass and steel foils, his team chose plastic films. Surprisingly rugged and cheap, the plastic would roll around a robot's narrow metal fingers without breaking\n.\nIt was the first ultrathin flexible e-skin in the world. \nA stretch of the imagination\nDespite these successes, there was still one major problem -- Someya's e-skin couldn't stretch.\nMeanwhile, at Princeton University in the United States, a team led by Professor Sigurd Wagner had begun\n \nmaking e-skins on rubber surfaces -- which could stretch.\nSomeya's team soon took note and began ink-jet printing their organic sensor grids onto plastic films, which were then laminated onto a pre-stretched rubber substrate.\nWhen the rubber was released, the plastic film shrunk and wrinkled -- just like skin -- and when the rubber was stretched again, the plastic could expand. The material was able to bend around the grooves of a robot's joint like clingfilm attached to its arm.\nHis electronic mesh could now be stretched by up to 250 per cent, yet crumple-up like paper, and be dropped from a height of 1 meter without breaking\n\"That was a truly big jump for us,\" says Someya. But another soon followed.\nIt may defy logic, but the thinner plastic e-skins get, the stronger they become. Between 2005 and 2013, Someya and his team worked endlessly to create e-skins on thinner and thinner plastic films, until they were just one micrometer thick -- one tenth the thickness of plastic wrap.\nIt has a sensitivity level comparable to that of a human.\n\"At this point we realized the e-skin shouldn't be limited to robots. We started placing the ultrathin film on the surface of human skin,\" he says.\nThe rise of super-sensitive humans\nIn 2014, the team laid an e-skin over the heart of a rat for three hours during surgery. By taking an electrocardiograph (the recording of electric activity of the heart) with good quality signals, the smart skin was able to detect the position of a heart defect in the rat.\n\"This kind of technique may be used for humans in the future,\" says Someya. Applying e-skins would put the heart under less pressure than typical electrodes. \nZhenan Bao, a professor of chemical engineering at Stanford University, is developing biodegradable materials that would mean e-skins implanted in the body would not need to be removed. \n\"Implantable medical devices could potentially measure the electrical current flow in the heart, the size of certain organs and how that changes with time. They could measure brain pressure,\" says Bao.\nIn 2015, Bao's team released \na paper\n suggesting that ultrasonic proximity sensors -- already trialled\n \non robots, to prevent them colliding with objects -- could be used to detect tiny tumors inside the body that human skin cannot feel. \"A doctor wearing an e-skin glove with such sensors could potentially detect a  tumor inside a patient's breast, as it is of a different density to the tissue,\" he says.\nEarlier this year, Someya's team then revealed an e-skin that can \nmonitor oxygen levels\n. The readings were brightly displayed through micro-electronic elements that lit up red, green or blue. A superthin e-skin on your hand could be turned into a digital display to view information on the move. It could even be adapted for more commercial purposes, like watching media.\nEventually, Someya hopes such skins will be used to monitor oxygen levels inside organs during surgery.\nYet another application for the e-skins could be to improve the abilities of modern-day prosthetics. If placed on a human's upper arm, the smart skin could detect signals from the brain and potentially transmit signals informing a prosthetic arm to move.\nThe opportunities are endless -- and not just in the field of medicine -- including  huge potential in the world of gaming and personal health tracking.\nBeyond medicine\nLast November, Someya invited Ichiro Amimori -- a member of his research team -- to launch a spin-off venture company for the work done at the Someya Lab. At the world's biggest tech fair \nCES\n 2016, Amimori unveiled motion capture suits for use with virtual reality gaming.\nMachine washable, the suits have sensors that monitor motion, breathing, and body temperature as they are built into a circuit-board design within the fabric. \n\"A player could control a boxing game just by their own movements,\" says Amimori.\nHis team has also developed motion sensor suits for infants, allowing parents to monitor their child's movements when they are not in the room.\n\"Right now these products are in prototype phase, they're still quite futuristic,\" says Amimori. \"But it's coming. We have a road map to take Someya's science into the actual world.\"\nSince his breakthrough, Someya says the field of e-skin has exploded, with teams around the globe working to eliminate the remaining barriers towards making them wearable.\n  \nBut his dreams for the technology stretch far and wide and are now returning to his original goal of uniting humans with their technology.\n\"The ultimate goal, our dream, is to harmonize humans and robots by making full use of soft electronics,\" he says. \"So humans get closer to robots and robots get closer to humans.\"", "Our bodies in space: Will you turn to mush?": "This research has ensured that astronauts could safely walk on the moon and live for more than a year on the International Space Station, 220 miles above the Earth's surface. But the Human Research Program, which aims to lessen the effects of the space environment on the health and performance of humans, is using the data to make sure they can send astronauts even deeper into the solar system.\nA six-month journey to Mars would only be the beginning of a challenging expedition to land people on the surface of the Red Planet, 140 million miles away. The crew members would then live and work there.\nIn preparation, NASA has been using six-month crew member rotations and Scott Kelly's groundbreaking one-year mission on the ISS to study the effects of space on the human body. So what happens when we have to transition from walking on solid ground to floating in zero gravity?\n\"I felt like I was falling,\" NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins told CNN's Rachel Crane. \"It was as if you're hanging off the rafters in a building and you let go, and that lasted for about 24 hours. My brain was taking a little while to get used to the fact that there was no up and down anymore. And that went away fairly quick. It takes a little while to get used to floating, too. It's almost like learning to walk all over again, a little bit.\"\nHopkins was on the ISS for 166 days, from September 2013 to March 2014. Though the adjustment to microgravity doesn't take long, other issues arise within the first few days due to a phenomenon in which the head tilts downward\n \nbetween 12 and 20 degrees, which causes disorientation.  \n\"As soon as you arrive in weightlessness, the fluids start shifting in your body from the lower part of your body into the upper part of your body,\" said  Dr. John Charles, Human Research Program associate manager for international science. \"Your organs of balance and your inner ear immediately sense there's no gravity pulling down on them anymore.\"\nThis causes something known among astronauts as Bird Leg Syndrome, because the fluid shift causes them to have puffy faces and thin legs. It also makes them less thirsty, dulls their sense of taste and causes a \"stuffy nose\" feeling similar to allergies. Space motion sickness also affects about 79% of astronauts who experience microgravity in the first 24 to 48 hours, creating a loss of appetite, dizziness and vomiting. \nLong-term risks\nHopkins also had to worry about the long-term effects on his body, such as the weakening and loss of bones and atrophying muscles. In space, without gravity, bones lose more than 1% of minerals and density per month. \nAstronauts also experience blood volume loss, weakened immune systems and cardiovascular deconditioning since floating takes little effort and the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood through your body, according to Human Research Program deputy chief scientist Jennifer A. Fogarty.  \nNASA has developed countermeasures to combat these known issues and how they might continue after landing back on Earth. Most involve making sure that astronauts stay healthy by consuming enough nutrients in their meals and supplements, in addition to using three\n \nspecially designed exercise machines on the ISS. \nAs soon as they overcome motion sickness, NASA wants its astronauts to start working out. It's also good for their sensory motor systems if their feet are striking the surface of something, like running on a treadmill, Fogarty said.\nThe three exercise machines\n \nmimic a treadmill, a stationary bike and a multipurpose weight machine. They're meant to stimulate the lower body, from running to squats and dead lifts, as the largest percent of bone loss occurs in the pelvis and femurs. Astronauts use the machines for two hours a day to compensate for the other 22 hours in which they aren't experiencing physical activity. \nIn addition to counteracting bone loss and atrophying muscles, the exercise provides a change of pace and mental release -- even if they have to bungee themselves to the treadmill to run in microgravity. \nBut one of the more recent effects of spaceflight noticed over the past five to seven years centers on eye health.  Kelly and other astronauts in their late 40s and 50s have complained about their vision being slightly altered. Some of them have required glasses in flight.\n\"It changes their visual acuity,\" Charles said. \"They're not able to see things up close. It's like advanced aging. That sort of thing happens at a sort of an accelerated rate.\"\nGiven the connection between the eye, optic nerve and brain, combined with the fluid shift astronauts experience, some research has suggested that the eyes act as a pressure release valve, Fogarty said. But her program has many studies in the works to get to the root of the cause and how to counteract it.\nEven though the ISS sits within Earth's protective magnetic field, astronauts are still exposed to 10 times the radiation that they would be on the ground. NASA monitors radiation exposure, given the fact that ISS crewmembers are considered radiation workers. \nThe agency has been able to limit radiation risks to 1%, but a mission to Mars would expose astronauts to harmful galactic cosmic rays. Without proper shielding, this can increase cancer risk, cause radiation sickness, alter cognitive and motor function, and even lead to cataracts and cardiac and circulatory diseases. \nThe reality of gravity\nAnd then there's landing on the ground again after experiencing zero gravity. Mars mission crew members would need to be able to get to work almost immediately after landing. Even though Mars has only a third of the gravity experienced on Earth, it would still be an adjustment for astronauts after floating for six months.\n\"[It] took a little bit longer to get used to life in gravity again,\" Hopkins said. \"I had some issues with, like, pitching moments. It just felt like if I bent [over], I would fall right on my face. And in microgravity, you lose references to how much things weigh. And so I remember when I first landed and I was laying in the Soyuz [the capsule used for landing] and I was just handing out our flight procedures. And that little book that maybe weighs a pound and a half felt like it weighed 25 or 30 pounds.\" \nBut even though our bodies weren't meant to live in space, the Human Research Program is always researching ways for us to thrive in the final frontier. The current countermeasures used on the ISS, the results of ongoing studies and recently funded proposals aiming to solve issues around human health, will aid astronauts as they push the limits of deep space in the 2020s and 2030s.\n\"Mother Nature always tells you the right answer, but you just have to ask the right question,\" Charles said. \"Our human bodies are up to the challenge of a trip to Mars and back.\"", "SpaceX does it again": "The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket sent a Thai communications satellite into orbit Friday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

No details related to cause of death were provided.\nFans across generations mourned his death, noting that it came just a month after the passing of his television daughter, \nPatty Duke\n. Schallert's role as patriarch Martin Lane on the popular 1960s show was among his most memorable, landing him on TV Guide's 2004 list of 50 Greatest TV Dads and setting the stage for a career playing authority figures.\nA recent recurring role on \"True Blood\" cast him as the mayor of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a testament to his enduring appeal and work ethic. \nSchallert was born on July 6, 1922. His father Edwin Schallert, was a reviewer and columnist for the Los Angeles Times. His mother, Elza, had her own radio show and wrote for movie fan magazines, according to \nHollywood Reporter\n. \nHe began his career with film roles in the 1940s and worked fairly consistently through 2014, appearing in recent shows including \"2 Broke Girls,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"How I Met Your Mother,\" and \"My Name is Earl.\"\nIn addition to \"The Patty Duke Show,\" earlier generations of television viewers might recognize him from parts in \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,\" \"Leave It to Beaver,\" \"The Waltons,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"The Wild Wild West,\" \"Get Smart\" and \"Hawaii Five-O.\"\nHe earned a spot in the \"\nStar Trek\n\" hall of fame for his role as Nilz Baris in the popular episode from the original series, \"The Trouble with Tribbles.\" Schallert later turned up as Baris in the \"Deep Space Nine\" hour \"Trials and Tribble-ations,\" and then in another guest star role as Varani in the DS9 episode \"Sanctuary.\" \nHe also appeared in movies, including the 1967 Oscar-winning best picture \"In the Heat of the Night\" as small-town Mississippi mayor Webb Schubert.\nHe served as as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1979 to 1981, overseeing a three-month strike that centered around rates and residuals for pay TV, videocassettes and videodiscs and included a successful boycott of the year's prime time Emmy Awards, according to \nVariety\n.

To wit, one of the first pop songs to deal openly with the danger posed by AIDS was\n \"Pretty Girls and Pretty Boys\" by Book of Love\n. \nRemember them? Maybe not. And that song didn't come out until 1988.\nA subject difficult to broach\nFew Hollywood films touched the topic. In fact, the most prominent box-office film about AIDS made in the 1980s -- \nNorman Rene's ''Longtime Companion'\n' -- didn't officially reach widespread movie theater distribution until 1990. It debuted the year before at the Mill Valley Film Festival in California, according to IMDb.com.\nOn American TV, there was a trickle of one-off episodes in the early '80s on several shows, typically medical dramas.\nIn 1983, NBC broadcast an episode of \"St. Elsewhere\" in which a politician checks into St. Eligius Hospital and learns he has AIDS. That episode is considered the first among prime time series to feature an AIDS patient, according to the Archive of American Television. Three years later, one of the show's most prominent characters, \nDr. Robert Caldwell, played by Mark Harmon\n, will learn he has been diagnosed with HIV. But that's three long years later.\nIn the meantime, another TV medical drama, \"Trapper John, M.D.\" would feature a minor character with AIDS in 1985. The same year, a TV movie called \"An Early Frost\" featured actor Aidan Quinn, whose character has AIDS. \nIt is widely considered the first film of any kind to deal with the AIDS epidemic.\nDavid Caplan, a celebrity journalist and former editor at People magazine, explained that popular culture considered the AIDS crisis a \"taboo\" topic. That's largely because an AIDS diagnosis back then was seen more or less as a death sentence -- and for many, it was just that.\nBecause of the taboo, early references to AIDS sometimes took unusual approaches, he said.\n\"It was always from afar and often involving a heterosexual character, which was good because it was trying to normalize it,\" Caplan said. \"But it was also questionable in terms of how realistic it was, because it was a disease that was ravaging the gay community.\" \nCaplan cites an episode of the NBC comedy \"Golden Girls\" in which Rose, Betty White's character, receives a letter from a hospital warning her about the epidemic after she received a blood transfusion.\n\"That was raising awareness of the disease, introducing it to other demographics,\" he said. \"Old white women would not perceive themselves as being involved in the AIDS epidemic.\"\nAnd yet, Caplan said, such treatments often strained credulity.\n\"It's like, I get it, but it's not realistic,\" he said.\nHe added, \"It was a disease a lot of people were not informed about. There were lots of misconceptions and obviously, TV and movies reflect the culture at large.\"\nThat \"Golden Girls\" episode aired in 1990 -- and yet it's one of the most cited examples of how 1980s Hollywood tried to deal with AIDS, unable to do so until the end of the decade.\nIn the music world\nThere were few songs that even hinted at the AIDS crisis until 1987 when \nAlex Chilton released \"No Sex,\"\n Prince made a quick reference to AIDS in a single line of the song \"Sign o' the Times,\" and the fourth single off Cyndi Lauper's \"True Colors\" album -- Boy Blue -- was dedicated to a friend who died of the disease.\nLou Reed, already an icon in the 1980s, \nreleased a song called \"Halloween Parade\" \nabout the effects of the AIDS crisis in New York. At the time, the song, released in 1989 on his well-received album \"New York,\" received little air time or critical notice. The content of the song was somewhat obscured by Reed's signature talk-like singing style.\nBook of Love's 1988 song \"Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls\" openly spelled out the danger of AIDS, with lyrics such as \"strangers in the night exchanging glances, but sex is dangerous, I don't take my chances ... safe sex, safe sex.\"\nNot surprisingly, one of the main venues to deal with the nascent AIDS crisis was Broadway, which has had a long history of employing gay playwrights, actors and others. One play in particular that reached a fairly broad audience broached the topic: Larry Kramer's \"The Normal Heart\" which opened on Broadway in 1985.\nIn Elton John's \n2014 CNN article, the legendary musician says \nthat Kramer's play \"tells a tale that many of us lived through, and many others did not survive.\"\nBased on Kramer's experiences in the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic, \"The Normal Heart\" was remade as an HBO movie in 2014. \n\"Back then,\" John wrote, \"The New York Times refused to print the word 'gay,' and New York Mayor Ed Koch was agonizingly slow to respond to the unfolding epidemic. Fear was everywhere.\"\nAIDs strikes Hollywood icon \nWhile Kramer's play opened on Broadway in 1985, Broadway's sister industry -- Hollywood -- was being forced to deal with the AIDS crisis. \nA leading man in dozens of popular, successful films in the 1950s and 1960s, Rock Hudson announced he was dying of AIDS. \nThe reaction, both public and private, was shock. The groundbreaking AIDS movie, \"Philadelphia,\" starring Tom Hanks, was still eight years away.\nHudson's illness was a wake-up call -- one heeded most prominently by one of his co-stars, actress Elizabeth Taylor.\nTaylor jump-started fundraising efforts for AIDs research with a 1985 benefit dinner for Hudson. He would soon collapse and die at age 59, becoming the \nfirst major celebrity to die of AIDS\n.\nThat dinner led to the establishment of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, amFAR, and Taylor became the face of the organization -- the face, in the artistic community, of the fight against AIDS.\nBy the end of the 1980s -- the decade that saw the dawn of HIV and AIDS -- the number of reported AIDS cases in the United States would reach 100,000, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. \nAs the deaths continued to pile up, many of the names would be drawn from the arts -- an industry that was still grappling with how to depict AIDS and HIV infection in movies, TV shows and music at the end of the 1980s.", "Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris reportedly split": "That's because Taylor Swift, who has been able to spin melodic gold out of heartbreak, is reportedly no longer an item with super producer Calvin Harris.\nPeople was the first to report \nthe split Wednesday.

She ain't faking it,\" in a tweet that included a video of the show's opening with a less-than-enthusiastic Braxton taking the stage with her co-hosts.\nSome who are unhappy with the decision have trolled the social media of the other co-hosts, including  Love. On Tuesday, Love posted a video on her official Facebook page saying she received a group text from Braxton saying she had heard she was being fired.\nThe comedian denied she had anything to do with Braxton being asked to leave the show or knew anything about it.\n \"When we wrapped our show for season 2 we had a photo shoot, Tamar was part of that,\" Love said. \"We were planning on going to Essence (Music Festival this summer in New Orleans), she was part of that so there was no indication that Tamar was going to be let go.\"\nFans have definitely been split into two camps: those who think Braxton was stabbed in the back and those who are happy to see her go.\nBraxton, who was forced to drop out of \"Dancing With the Stars\" in 2015 after she developed blood clots in her lungs, has an outspoken supporter in co-host Mowry-Housley.\n The former \"Sister, Sister\" star posted a photo of herself with Braxton on Instagram with a caption that read in part, \"Tay Tay. Words can not express how much I will miss working with you side by side.\"\n\"Thank you for understanding me always,\" Mowry-Housley wrote. \"In front of the camera but most importantly behind.

But  this season, the show seems to have pressed the fast-forward button, with crime bosses and stars rising and falling, and the city plummeting into a cesspool of corruption and violence.\nIn many ways, the show is grandiose and over the top. The staging helps add to that, as CNN saw firsthand with a tour of the show's Brooklyn set. \nWith so many TV series, things look much bigger than they actually are, but in the case of Gotham City's police station, that's not the case.\nThe workplace of Detectives Jim Gordon and Harvey Bullock is incredibly detailed, right down to never-shown documents on police officers' desks that say \"Gotham City.\" It's little touches like that, the producers said, that help bring a sense of realism to the larger-than-life proceedings.\nThe living room of Wayne Manor and the apartment belonging to Edward Nygma (a.k.a. the Riddler) have depth and feel lived-in. \nArkham Asylum, where the many criminals of Gotham pay their debt to society, has a grimy feel.\n\"It's part of the look that (pilot director) Danny Cannon wanted to establish,\" executive producer John Stephens said. \"We shoot with wide-angle lenses, and the wider the lenses, the more articulated you need to have your sets be, so we end up with a lot of sets like this.\n\"Some sets (for other series) have cardboard walls,\" Stephens added. \"These feel like they're real. It also helps the actors to don the characters they have to play and brings some reality to it. It pays off in multiple ways.\"\nThere's even a \"Batcave,\" though it's not called that yet.\n\"Gotham\" was the second in what has been a wave of TV series based on DC Comics (a Time Warner company, like CNN). It's since been joined by shows such as \"The Flash\" and \"Supergirl.\"\nBut this \"Gotham,\" being a prequel, stands on its own and works equally well for fans of the comics as it does for fans of mafia stories. \nStephens said it was a conscious decision by the producers to free themselves from a formula.\n\"Once we abandoned the classical police procedural framework, people started doing bad things to each other,\" he said, including the unexpected death of the character Jerome, who many fans expected to grow up to be the Joker.\n\"We developed more the idea of arch-villains this year,\" Stephens said. \"We designed this year as one full story but breaks into two halves very evenly.\n\"A bomb gets dropped on everybody,\" he added. \"It's going to be amazing.\"\nViewers can expect to see two major characters from the comics this season, as well: Hugo Strange (played by B.D. Wong) and Azrael.\n\"He's a proto-Batman. He wears a cowl and fights crime but also kills people,\" serving as a warning to Bruce, according to Stephens.\nAnd as this saga continues, viewers can look forward as much to the distinct \"Gotham\"-esque look of new locations, just as much as the new characters.", "Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna get reality show": "Rob Kardashian and his fiancee Blac Chyna have scored a reality series on E!.

Network execs had told her it was a man's job, citing Sid Caesar, Jackie Gleason and Dean Martin. But Burnett's contract said she could do a variety show if she wanted to -- and she wanted to.\nThanks to her talent -- along with that of Harvey Korman, Tim Conway, Vicki Lawrence, Lyle Waggoner and a tremendous staff -- the show lasted for 11 years.

Despite the drug use, she was still coherent enough to realize that Tupac would become a product of the streets if she didn't make different choices. \n\"I was running around with militants, trying to be badder than I was, trying to stay up later than I should,\" she said in the 2005 interview. \nShe decided to enroll Tupac in the 127th Street Ensemble, a Harlem theater group, something she called \"the best thing I could've done in my insanity.\" They later moved to Maryland, where she enrolled him in the Baltimore School for the Arts, and then to a small town outside Sausalito. \nIt was there that Tupac confronted her about her cocaine use.\n\"He asked me if I could handle it, and I said yeah because I'd been dipping and dabbing all my life,\" she said during the interview. \"What pissed him off is that I lied to him.\"\n'Pac told the local drug dealers not to sell to her, she said, and he told his mother to get clean or to forget about being involved in his life. \n'Arts can save children'\nShe got clean in 1991, she said, and when her son was gunned down in Las Vegas in 1996, she resisted the urges to delve back into her old bad habits. She instead founded Amaru Entertainment to keep her son's music alive. \nLater, she realized that her life -- mistake-ridden as it may have been -- might serve as a lesson to others. \n\"Arts can save children, no matter what's going on in their homes,\" she said. \"I wasn't available to do the right things for my son. If not for the arts, my child would've been lost.\"\nShe provided the majority of the money to begin the $4 million first phase of the arts center, while her Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation hosted poetry and theater camps for youngsters in the Atlanta area. The family said she established the foundation to \"instill a sense of freedom of expression and education through the arts.\"\n\"I learned that I can't save the world, but I can help a child at a time,\" she said, pointing out that her new life of philanthropy wouldn't have been possible without the influence of her legendary son. \"God created a miracle with his spirit. I'm all right with that.\"\nAnd as much as she credited Tupac with inspiring her to help others, the tribulations she endured in raising him weren't lost on the multiplatinum artist. He regularly invoked her in his music, perhaps never as directly as in his chart-topping song, \"Dear Mama.\"\nIn it, \nhe rapped\n, \"And even as a crack fiend, mama, you always was a black queen, mama/I finally understand, for a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man/You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it/There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan is to show you that I understand.\"\nShakur Davis is survived by a daughter, Sekyiwa Shakur.\nKendrick Lamar remembers Tupac", "'Nashville' has alternative ending": "The show ended after four seasons with a cliffhanger featuring Juliette Barnes (played by actress Hayden Panettiere) rushing off to reunite with her beloved ex-husband Avery Barkley (actor Jonathan Jackson) and their daughter when her plane goes missing.

When that failed, he did the next best thing: He posted a photo on her Instagram.\n\"Hey i found your phone/bag outside griffith,\" the caption read. \"I texted some contacts in ur phone with my number but nobody's responding. I gotta head out in 30 mins please hit me up. Lol you have a lot of followers.\"\nWagner then posted about his disappointment that Disturbed wasn't playing at the Coachella festival -- because who can resist having the attention of more than 7 million followers? \n\"Why isnt DISTURBED playing at coachella,\" he wrote on a photo he posted on Bellisario's Instagram account. \"My uncle tony told me they were headlining and i believed him until now. Apparently he lied to me! Every band at coachella is a joke compared to disturbed. Im extremely upset about this #coachella2016 guys never trust ur uncles especially if their name is tony.\"\nInstead of losing it, Bellisario borrowed a friend's phone (director Tommy Bertelsen), changed her passwords, got in touch with Wagner and apologized to her followers \"for the previous posts and if they weirded anyone out.\"\nThen she did the nicest thing. \nWhen Wagner informed her he was on his way to Coachella, she asked him to keep her phone safe and told him he could use all her access wristbands for the event. He just had to Snapchat his experiences. \nNaturally Wagner freaked out at the generosity of \"Trojan.\"\nHe also proceeded to have the best time, even meeting producer Zedd and hanging at Skrillex's party.\nEven Bellisario was a little envious, posting she was \"Hosting my own #Coachella2016 watching Jack have a blast on my snapchat.\" She then invited Wagner to her house for a watch party for the Season 6 premiere of \"Game of Thrones.\"\nWhen the pair finally met up for the phone exchange, the actress declared that Wagner had \"won #Coachella2016.\" \nNow here's hoping fans aren't following Bellisario around waiting for her to lose something else.

It's \n25 to 50 times more potent than heroin\n and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\nPrince, whose full name was Prince Rogers Nelson, died April 21 at age 57, after being found unresponsive in an elevator at Paisley Park, his home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota.\nOpioids and overdoses: 4 things to know\nThe report from the medical examiner's office, which was released on Twitter, didn't provide many details. \"How injury occurred: The decedent self-administered fentanyl,\" the report said. For manner of death, a box was marked for \"accident.\"\nThe report didn't specify how the drug was taken and if the fentanyl was prescribed or illegally made.\nThe music superstar weighed 112 pounds and was 63 inches tall when he died, the report said. He was wearing a black cap, shirt, pants, boxer briefs and socks and a gray undershirt, the report said. His occupation was listed as \"artist\" and his business as \"music.\"\nThe full autopsy and toxicology reports will not be released, the office told CNN. \nSince his death, information has emerged about the entertainer's alleged abuse of prescription drugs.\nA law enforcement source told CNN's Evan Perez in April that the entertainer was found with opioid medication at the time of his death. Investigators so far haven't found any indication that Prince had a valid prescription for the recovered opioid medications\nAn attorney for Prince's half-siblings said they revealed the singer had an addiction to Percocet decades before he died. One half-sibling said Prince started using the drug to help him deal with the rigors of performing, not for recreational use. \nOpioid history: From 'wonder drug' to abuse epidemic \nOn April 15, on his way home after performing in Atlanta, Prince's plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois. Prince was unresponsive and taken to a hospital. A law enforcement official told CNN he was treated for a potential overdose of pain medication.\nPrince's most iconic moments\nThe day before Prince died, his team called an eminent opioid addiction specialist in California seeking urgent help for the singer, an attorney working for the specialist and his son said.\nThe specialist, Dr. Howard Kornfeld, couldn't get there immediately so he sent his son, Andrew Kornfeld, on an overnight flight to Minnesota. The goal was for the younger Kornfeld to help evaluate Prince's health and encourage him to enter treatment for pain management and potential addiction issues, attorney William Mauzy told reporters.\nPrince's complicated history with painkillers\nBut by the time Andrew Kornfeld arrived at the singer's Paisley Park complex on the morning of April 21, it was too late. He and two Prince representatives found the 57-year-old entertainer unresponsive in an elevator. Andrew Kornfeld was the person who called 911, Mauzy said.\nAuthorities have also said the investigation into Prince's death is a criminal investigation. It was not immediately clear if Kornfeld is the subject of a separate investigation.\nFederal prosecutors and the Drug Enforcement Administration are investigating how Prince obtained prescription medications and from whom, the agencies said. ", "Singer-songwriter Guy Clark dies at 74": "The Texas native died Tuesday in Nashville after a long illness, according to a statement from his publicist. He was 74.\nAlthough he never found widespread fame, Clark recorded albums for almost 40 years, wrote hit songs for other artists and was revered by the Nashville music community for his songcraft and generosity of spirit. His best-known songs, such as \"L.A. Freeway\" and  \"Desperados Waiting For A Train,\" were evocative tales of ramblers and dreamers, inspired by his own life.\nClark's songs were recorded by a who's who of country and Americana music, including Johnny Cash, Ricky Skaggs, Emmylou Harris, Brad Paisley, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Jimmy Buffett, Kenny Chesney and many others.\n\"Oh Lord, just heard Guy Clark passed away. He was a huge influence on me, and an amazing writer. God bless his soul. What a life,\" Paisley said on Twitter.\n\"Travel safe, old friend. I would not be the songwriter I am if I hadn't sat at your table and learned from a master,\" added singer Roseanne Cash, also on Twitter.\nBorn in the dusty west Texas town of Monahans on November 6, 1941, Clark flirted with college and the Peace Corps before opening a guitar-repair shop in Houston. He spent his spare time playing coffee shops and nightclubs, where he  joined a bluegrass band and befriended such fellow songwriters as Townes Van Zandt and Jerry Jeff Walker.\nAs a young man, he moved to Los Angeles, seeking fame and fortune. But he didn't stay long, moving with his wife Susanna to Nashville in 1971. After he left California, he wrote the song \"L.A. Freeway\" -- later recorded by many other artists -- which included the line, \"If I can just get off of this L.A. freeway without getting killed or caught.\"\nHe later said it took him years after O.J. Simpson's famous slow-speed Bronco chase before he could sing that line without breaking into laughter.\nClark released his debut album, \"Old No. 1,\" for RCA Records in 1975 and scored a No. 1 country hit in 1982 with Ricky Skaggs's take on \"Heartbroke.\" He recorded 13 albums and toured consistently over the next three decades, sometimes with such fellow artists as Lyle Lovett and John Hiatt. \n\"It's what I enjoy,\" he \nonce said of songwriting\n. \"It gets harder, all the time. It doesn't fall out of the sky, you know. But I have joy doing the work, I enjoy the creative process. I write and build guitars in the same space, and I find that one is right brain and one is left brain, and they kind of feed off of one another. But, I don't know. It's just a way to while away the time until you die.\"\nDespite a gruff demeanor, Clark was considered one of country music's nicest men. He enjoyed helping young musicians and was perpetually looking for artists who might record a song written by one of his friends. \nClark was unpretentious in the extreme -- a blue jeans type of guy -- with down-home values summed up in songs like, \"Stuff That Works,\" with its opening line: \"I got an old blue shirt and it suits me just fine / I like the way it feels so I wear it all the time.\"\nClark won his first and only Grammy late in life in 2014, for a folk album called \"My Favorite Picture of You.\" The album title referred to a snapshot of his wife, Susanna, who had died two years earlier.

The film also won for Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer's original screenplay.\nBut until that moment, it looked like \"Revenant,\" about a vengeful trapper in the 1820s, was going to go all the way. \nFollow all the action with our Oscar blog\nAlejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu notched his second straight Oscar in the directing category; he's the first person to pull off that feat since Joseph L. Mankiewicz in 1949-50. The film's Emmanuel Lubezki also kept a streak going, winning his third straight Oscar for cinematography. \nBut the big story was DiCaprio, who finally won an Oscar with his fifth acting nomination.\nLeonardo DiCario finally gets his Oscar\nAfter taking some time to thank I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, co-star Tom Hardy and director Martin Scorsese, among others, DiCaprio put in a plug for environmentalism.\n\"Climate change is real. It is happening right now; we needed to go to the tip of South America to find snow. ... It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species,\" he said. \"We need to support leaders around the world who speak for indigenous people, for humanity, the voices who have been drowned out by the politics of greed. Do not take this planet for granted. ... I do not take this night for granted. Thank you.\"\nSome shockers\nThough most awards were expected, given the expertise of close-watching Oscar handicappers these days, the night wasn't without its shockers.\nMark Rylance won best supporting actor for his performance as a Soviet agent in \"Bridge of Spies.\"\nThe category included Sylvester Stallone, who was widely believed to be the front-runner for his performance as Rocky Balboa in \"Creed\" -- 39 years after he first played the role in \"Rocky.\"\n\"Writing's on the Wall,\" Sam Smith's song from the James Bond film \"Spectre,\" won best song -- an announcement that came not long after\n Lady Gaga brought the house down\n with a performance of her nominated song, \" 'Til It Happens to You.\" \nAfter a streak of technical awards to \"Mad Max,\" \"Ex Machina\" won for visual effects.\nEnnio Morricone, the legendary composer of such film scores as \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" and \"The Untouchables,\" finally won an Oscar, his first in six nominations. It was for Quentin Tarantino's \"The Hateful Eight.\"\nAnd, in perhaps the biggest shock of all, the show was rather brisk, lasting just over 3\u00bd hours. That's actually longer than some shows of recent years, including the 2011 show with James Franco and Anne Hathaway, but given the program's propensity for pushing four hours, it's not something to be taken for granted.\nRock comes out hard\nPerhaps that was at least partly due to the host, the no-holds-barred Chris Rock.\nRock wasted no time in taking on #OscarsSoWhite and diversity issues that had been in the news since the nominations were announced in mid-January.\nAfter the obligatory montage of the year's movies, Rock came out and said he'd counted at least 15 black people in the video -- and, just like that, he was off.\nChris Rock: 'You're damn right Hollywood is racist'\n\"If they nominated hosts, I wouldn't even get this job,\" he said. \"You'd be watching Neil Patrick Harris right now.\"\nNoting the lack of black nominees through most of Oscar history, he pointed out that in the '60s, \"black people did not protest because we had real things to protest at the time. We were too busy being raped and lynched to worry about best cinematography.\"\nAnd \"In Memoriam,\" the yearly segment of people who had passed away in the previous year, would get an addition, Rock said.\n\"In the In Memoriam package, it's just going to be black people shot by the cops on the way to the movies.\"\nSome of his lines earned gasps from the audience, and the New York Daily News believed he had gone too far. \nBut his stint appeared to have gone well overall. \nRock went back to the Magic Johnson Theaters in Compton to ask African-American moviegoers about the year's nominated films. Almost none of the patrons had seen them.\nAnd he even helped his daughter sell Girl Scout cookies.\nBeating the bear\n In the other major awards, Brie Larson won best actress for her performance in \"Room,\" and Alicia Vikander won best supporting actress for her work in \"The Danish Girl.\"\n\"Inside Out\" won best animated feature.\nIn recent weeks, it appeared that \"The Revenant\" would top them all. The film featured gripping photography and DiCaprio's intense performance and made a set piece of a vicious bear attack. It had won some major prizes, including the Directors Guild prize for I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, and the Motion Picture Academy rarely splits honors between director and picture.\nBut \"Spotlight,\" which had been quietly collecting honors of its own, came through on deadline.\nThe 88th Academy Awards aired from Hollywood's Dolby Theatre.

And so the repurposing goes, with the latest big-screen iteration a clunky composite of visual extravagance and Hollywood commonplaces about a life well lived.\nA sequel to Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" the James Bobin-directed feature is just as overstuffed a phantasmagoria of CGI and makeup as the 2010 film.\nIts imagery can be striking or merely distracting, yet rarely transporting. Bypassing child-friendly charm for backstory psychology, its dreamscape is weighted with yadda-yadda-yadda about being true to yourself, honoring family and being loyal to friends. But there's no question that the Johnny Depp-starring spectacle, going out in an assortment of 3D formats, will, like its billion-dollar-grossing predecessor, attract fans worldwide.\nRead more: Disney rules Hollywood's fairy-tale war as other studios bite the poisoned apple\nAs \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" kicks off its message-laden adventure, the title character (Mia Wasikowska) is a brave and capable ship's captain. Back in London but eager to return to the frothy fray, she learns she's facing foreclosure on her vessel thanks to a bit of desperate deal-making by her mother (Lindsay Duncan) with the spiteful upper-class twit (Leo Bill) whose marriage proposal Alice rejected.\nPutting aside the matter of her colonialist exploits, Wasikowska's Alice Kingsleigh is a convention-defying, self-actualized Victorian female. \nBut in case we haven't appreciated the depths of her fortitude and accomplishment, Linda Woolverton's screenplay informs us that the word \"impossible\" is anathema to Alice. Colleen Atwood's splendid jewel-bright outfits reflect her travels through China and emphasize her worldliness against the conformity of London society. But though Alice's beloved ship is rather pointedly named The Wonder, the movie offers only a paucity of the same.\nWoolverton, whose revisionist reading of a femme-centric fairy tale had a potent intensity in Maleficent, here puts her heroine on a time-traveling quest to rewrite history. At stake is the very survival of Alice's friend the Mad Hatter (Depp), who's dying of depression and regret over his missing family, the specifics of their fate a tormenting mystery for him.\nDepp is convincingly vulnerable and forlorn, all while maintaining the Hatter's otherworldly eccentricity, and Wasikowska has the requisite grit. But Alice's mission feels as manufactured as the story's whatsits and doodads, as Bobin struggles to infuse make-believe with emotion (something he managed winningly within the comic realm of The Muppets). \nThe story, which has nothing to do with Carroll's episodic 1871 book beyond its title and a clutch of key characters, plays out as a blenderized mix of standard fantasy action and Burtonesque Gothic-alia. Its other key ingredients: a Wicked-reminiscent look at the roots of sibling rivalry and unpersuasive reminders that there's no place like home.\nLeading Alice away from home and back to Underland is the film's fleeting glimpse of ethereal playfulness, the former caterpillar Absolem, now a blue butterfly voiced with plummy richness by the late Alan Rickman (to whom the picture is dedicated). Other returning Brits deliver fine voice work as well: Matt Lucas, as the rhyming Tweedles, Stephen Fry (Cheshire Cat), Michael Sheen (White Rabbit), Timothy Spall (Bayard the bloodhound), Barbara Windsor (Dormouse) and Paul Whitehouse (March Hare).\nBut center stage, or a good part of it, belongs to the psychodrama between the warring queens, played again by Anne Hathaway, in frosty pallor, and Helena Bonham Carter, a magnificent amalgam of digitally enhanced malevolence and wounded inner child. \nHer irascible Iracebeth, better known as the Red Queen, has a new ally this time around: Time himself, played by Sacha Baron Cohen (who worked with Bobin on Da Ali G Show). A sort of grim reaper with an Austrian accent \u2014 or is he channeling Christoph Waltz? \u2014 Time has ice-blue eyes, a man bun and a skull filled with clock workings. Besides his Transformer-ish goons, his underlings include a collection of anthropomorphized metal contraptions led by the mustachioed Wilkins (Matt Vogel).\nThat these small clanking employees are Time's \"seconds\" is a nice bit of wordplay, and, along with Time's thesaural speech, it's one of the movie's few nods to Carroll's inventive infatuation with language. But these conceits, like so much of the film's details, get lost in the exhausting race against, um, Time.\nRead more: Disney's 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' gets China release date\nAt the center of Time's gloomy castle is the Chronosphere, a thingamajig that will take Alice back to the Mad Hatter's childhood, where she hopes to undo the disastrous events that aggrieve him. The Red Queen has her own reasons for wanting the gadget \u2014 world control, naturally, but also a deep-seated need to right a primal wrong from her own childhood. The hopping across years reveals all-too-obvious parallels among the three narrative strands: the Red Queen's grudge, the conflict between Alice and her security-minded mother, and the Mad Hatter's despair over his father (Rhys Ifans), who didn't appreciate his singular sensibility.\nAmid the frenetic back-and-forth, there's plenty to admire, if not be truly wowed by, in the whiz-bang effects work and the robust production design by Dan Hennah (The Hobbit). Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography showcases the exuberance of the sets and costumes, with palettes that range from stygian to dazzling. If only the sensory overload were hallucinatory or simply less fettered and more fun.\nOne of the few affecting elements amid the would-be whimsy involves a child's handmade creation \u2014 the kind of imperfect, idiosyncratic beauty that the movie argues for but doesn't achieve. Like the Chronosphere that powers much of its action, Through the Looking Glass is the stuff of revved-up mechanics, not magic.\nSee the original story at The Hollywood Reporter's site. ", "Ronan Farrow writes about Woody Allen": "These were the objections from a producer at my network. It was September 2014 and I was preparing to interview a respected journalist about his new biography of Bill Cosby. The book omitted allegations of rape and sexual abuse against the entertainer, and I intended to focus on that omission. That producer was one of several industry veterans to warn me against it. At the time, there was little more than a stalled lawsuit and several women with stories, all publicly discredited by Cosby's PR team. There was no criminal conviction. It was old news. It wasn't news.\nSo we compromised: I would raise the allegations, but only in a single question late in the interview. And I called the author, reporter to reporter, to let him know what was coming. He seemed startled when I brought it up. I was the first to ask about it, he said. He paused for a long time, then asked if it was really necessary. On air, he said he'd looked into the allegations and they didn't check out.\nToday, the number of accusers has risen to 60. The author has apologized. And reporters covering Cosby have been forced to examine decades of omissions, of questions unasked, stories untold. I am one of those reporters \u2014 I'm ashamed of that interview.\nRead more: The Woody Allen interview (Which he won't read)\nSome reporters have \ndrawn connections\n between the press' grudging evolution on Cosby and a painful chapter in my own family's history. It was shortly before the Cosby story exploded anew that my sister Dylan Farrow wrote about her own experiences \u2014 alleging that our father, Woody Allen, had \"groomed\" her with inappropriate touching as a young girl and sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old.\nBeing in the media as my sister's story made headlines, and Woody Allen's PR engine revved into action, gave me a window into just how potent the pressure can be to take the easy way out. Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with another one of my siblings. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer \u2014 therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points \u2014 a self-perpetuating spin machine.\nThe open CC list on those emails revealed reporters at every major outlet with whom that publicist shared relationships \u2014 and mutual benefit, given her firm's starry client list, from Will Smith to Meryl Streep. Reporters on the receiving end of this kind of PR blitz have to wonder if deviating from the talking points might jeopardize their access to all the other A-list clients.\nIn fact, when my sister first decided to speak out, she had gone to multiple newspapers \u2014 most wouldn't touch her story. An editor at the Los Angeles Times sought to publish her letter with an accompanying, deeply fact-checked timeline of events, but his bosses killed it before it ran. The editor called me, distraught, since I'd written for them in the past. There were too many relationships at stake. It was too hot for them. He fought hard for it. (Reached by The Hollywood Reporter, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Times said the decision not to publish was made by the Opinion editors.)\nWhen The New York Times ultimately ran \nmy sister's story\n in 2014, it gave her 936 words online, embedded in an article with careful caveats. Nicholas Kristof, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and advocate for victims of sexual abuse, put it on \nhis blog.\nSoon afterward, the Times gave her alleged attacker twice the space \u2014 and prime position in the print edition, with no caveats or surrounding context. It was a stark reminder of how differently our press treats vulnerable accusers and powerful men who stand accused.\nRead more: Full coverage of Cannes Film Festival \nPerhaps I succumbed to that pressure myself. I had worked hard to distance myself from my painfully public family history and wanted my work to stand on its own. So I had avoided commenting on my sister's allegations for years and, when cornered, cultivated distance, limiting my response to the occasional line on Twitter. My sister's decision to step forward came shortly after I began work on a book and a television series. It was the last association I wanted. Initially, I begged my sister not to go public again and to avoid speaking to reporters about it. I'm ashamed of that, too. With sexual assault, anything's easier than facing it in full, saying all of it, facing all of the consequences. Even now, I hesitated before agreeing to The Hollywood Reporter's invitation to write this piece, knowing it could trigger another round of character assassination against my sister, my mother or me.\nBut when Dylan explained her agony in the wake of powerful voices sweeping aside her allegations, the press often willing to be taken along for the ride, and the fears she held for young girls potentially being exposed to a predator \u2014 I ultimately knew she was right. I began to speak about her more openly, particularly on social media. And I began to look carefully at my own decisions in covering sexual assault stories.\nI believe my sister. This was always true as a brother who trusted her, and, even at 5 years old, was troubled by our father's strange behavior around her: climbing into her bed in the middle of the night, forcing her to suck his thumb \u2014 behavior that had prompted him to enter into therapy focused on his inappropriate conduct with children prior to the allegations.\nBut more importantly, I've approached the case as an attorney and a reporter, and found her allegations to be credible. The facts are persuasive and well documented. I won't list them again here, but most have been meticulously \nreported by journalist Maureen Orth in Vanity Fair. \nThe only final legal disposition is\n a custody ruling\n that found Woody Allen's behavior \"grossly inappropriate\" and stressed that \"measures must be taken to protect [Dylan].\"\nOn May 4, The Hollywood Reporter published \na cover interview with Woody Allen\n, quirky auteur. To me it is a sterling example of how not to talk about sexual assault. Dylan's allegations are never raised in the interview and receive only a parenthetical mention \u2014 an inaccurate reference to charges being \"dropped.\" THR later issued a correction: \"not pursued.\"\nThe correction points to what makes Allen, Cosby and other powerful men so difficult to cover. The allegations were never backed by a criminal conviction. This is important. It should always be noted. But it is not an excuse for the press to silence victims, to never interrogate allegations. Indeed, it makes our role more important when the legal system so often fails the vulnerable as they face off against the powerful.\nHere is exactly what charges not being pursued looked like in my sister's case in 1993: The prosecutor met with my mother and sister. Dylan already was deeply traumatized \u2014 by the assault and the subsequent legal battle that forced her to repeat the story over and over again. (And she did tell her story repeatedly, without inconsistency, despite the emotional toll it took on her.) The longer that battle, the more grotesque the media circus surrounding my family grew. My mother and the prosecutor decided not to subject my sister to more years of mayhem. In a rare step, the prosecutor announced publicly that he had \"probable cause\" to prosecute Allen, and attributed the decision not to do so to \"the fragility of the child victim.\"\nMy mother still feels it was the only choice she could make to protect her daughter. But it is ironic: My mother's decision to place Dylan's well-being above all else became a means for Woody Allen to smear them both.\nVery often, women with allegations do not or cannot bring charges. Very often, those who do come forward pay dearly, facing off against a justice system and a culture designed to take them to pieces. A reporter's role isn't to carry water for those women. But it is our obligation to include the facts, and to take them seriously. Sometimes, we're the only ones who can play that role.\nConfronting a subject with allegations from women or children, not backed by a simple, dispositive legal ruling is hard. It means having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures. It means going up against angry fans and angry publicists.\nThere are more reporters than ever showing that courage, and more outlets supporting them. Many are of a new generation, freed from the years of access journalism that can accrete around older publications. BuzzFeed has done pioneering reporting on recent Hollywood sexual assault stories. It was Gawker that asked why allegations against Bill Cosby weren't taken more seriously. And it is heartening that The Hollywood Reporter asked me to write this response. Things are changing.\nBut the old-school media's slow evolution has helped to create a culture of impunity and silence. Amazon paid millions to work with Woody Allen, bankrolling a new series and film. Actors, including some I admire greatly, continue to line up to star in his movies. \"It's not personal,\" one once told me. But it hurts my sister every time one of her heroes like Louis C.K., or a star her age, like Miley Cyrus, works with Woody Allen. Personal is exactly what it is \u2014 for my sister, and for women everywhere with allegations of sexual assault that have never been vindicated by a conviction.\nTonight, the Cannes Film Festival kicks off with a new Woody Allen film. There will be press conferences and a red-carpet walk by my father and his wife (my sister). He'll have his stars at his side \u2014 Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg. They can trust that the press won't ask them the tough questions. It's not the time, it's not the place, it's just not done.\nThat kind of silence isn't just wrong. It's dangerous. It sends a message to victims that it's not worth the anguish of coming forward. It sends a message about who we are as a society, what we'll overlook, who we'll ignore, who matters and who doesn't.\nWe are witnessing a sea change in how we talk about sexual assault and abuse. But there is more work to do to build a culture where women like my sister are no longer treated as if they are invisible. It's time to ask some hard questions.\nFarrow's investigative reporting series, \"Undercovered With Ronan Farrow,\" airs on NBC's 'Today.'\nSee the original story at The Hollywood Reporter's website.

If you don't know where that reputation came from, all you have to do is eyeball some old Talking Heads videos. \nThe 1983 video for \"Burning Down the House\" featured Byrne's giant open-mouthed face sliding down a highway, a child version of himself and awkward synchronized shoulder dancing. \nThe title of the song is inspired by a \nParliament Funkadelic \naudience chant, which drummer Chris Frantz was yelling around the studio before Byrne decided to use a modified version for the name of the song.\nAnyhow, the video is a fully legal acid trip, and still a bit haunting to this day.\n\"Land of Confusion\" by Genesis\nIf you had to describe this 1986 \nGenesis \nvideo to someone who had never seen it, you might say that it was about the Reagans -- and that Ronald drowns, dresses like Superman and meets a Triceratops. Prince also turns his tongue into a hot dog. \nDid we mention the characters were all puppets from the British television show \n\"Spitting Image\"\n? They were certainly not Jim Henson's cute Muppets. In fact, they were all terrifying. \nGenesis frontman \nPhil Collins\n commissioned the show's creators for the video after seeing himself on \"Spitting Image\" as a caricature. \n\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" by Bonnie Tyler \nDid you know this karaoke favorite has a completely bewildering video that plays like a drowsy memory of a nightmare? \nThe dancing ninjas should give it away, but they're really just getting it started. Think wandering in a dark house, topless football players awkwardly gesticulating and a chorus of people with white zombie eyes. Terrifying! \nIt was filmed in 1983 at Holloway Sanatorium, a Victorian Gothic hospital in Surrey, which borders Greater London. We suppose Bonnie Tyler wanted it to be spooky -- and she succeeded.\n\"Loverboy\" by Billy Ocean\nThere seems to be a common theme in a lot of videos from the '80s: bizarre scenarios that have little to nothing to do with the song's lyrics.\nBilly Ocean \nsticks with that theme in his 1985 video for \"Loverboy,\" which is a rocking song all on its own. The video seems to want us to know that a hooded man on a similarly hooded horse is on a quest to meet aliens that have stumbled out of Mos Eisley Cantina from \"Star Wars.\" \nWhy was everyone so obsessed with puppets in the '80s? And more importantly, what do the men with TVs for heads have to do with the little guys bowing to the cube? \nSo confused.\n\"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel\nPeter Gabriel\n's \"Sledgehammer\" got major airplay both on radio and on MTV in 1986, and the video won nine awards at the \n1987 MTV Video Music Awards\n. \nIt used claymation, stop-motion animation and pixelation to create funky images of Gabriel as his face was covered with fruit, transformed into modern art and used as a train track. The singer also lay under a sheet of glass for 16 hours while filming it.\nThe folks behind it were none other than \nAardman Animations\n -- who would go on to create \n\"Wallace and Gromit\"\n -- and The Brothers Quay, highly influential stop-motion animators. \nWhile \"Sledgehammer\" was very weird (think dead dancing chickens weird), we must admit it was a major technical feat. It was also a hit, and holds the honor of being the most-played video ever.\n\"Self Control\" by Laura Branigan\nIt's probably a dead giveaway that this 1984 video will be odd as soon as you see that \nLaura Branigan\n apparently lives with a ballerina who wears full stage makeup at all times. (Does she even know that she's there? It's never clarified.) \nThen she catches a cab that's driven by the Phantom of the Opera, who apparently becomes obsessed with her at first sight. \nThere's an orgy later, too. If this is what the nightlife is like where you live, it's probably safer to stay in. \nThe video was actually directed by William Friedkin of \"The Exorcist\" fame, which may explain some of its creep factor. Friedkin described his vision for the video as \"edgy and dark\" in \na 2012 interview with The Austin Chronicle\n.\n\"Nothing Bad Ever Happens to Me\" by Oingo Boingo\nA bathtub catches on fire. Lead singer \nDanny Elfman\n shaves while women dressed as statues sing to him. Disembodied faces sing from the walls as Elfman spastically dances. \nWe'd love to have been in on the pitch meeting for this 1983 video: \"So, the main course served in the dinner scene will be THREE singing human heads!\" How does \nthat \nget greenlit?\n\"Sat in Your Lap\" by Kate Bush \nMuch like the Talking Heads video, \nKate Bush\n is wonderfully weird, so her videos fit the bill as well. \nIn the 1981 video for \"Sat in Your Lap,\" Bush flails along with red and yellow jesters and roller skates with people wearing dunce caps as they disappear into a faraway light. \nLater, guys with bull horns and ears show up and everyone dances together. It's also notable that Bush's expression in this video is equally as scary as all the characters! \nIn a 1981 interview on the English childrens' show \"Razzmatazz,\"\n Bush said that the song itself was direct inspiration for the video, and she drew the storyboards for \"Sat in Your Lap\" herself.", "Patti LaBelle's cakes and other moonlighting celebs": "", "'Hamilton' shatters Tonys nomination record": "The production was nominated for best musical and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda received nominations for best book of a musical, best performance by an actor in a leading role in a musical, and best original score written for the theater. \nThe best performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical category saw three out of the five spots nabbed by \"Hamilton\" actors: Daveed Digg, Jonathan Groff and Christopher Jackson.\nThe musical has taken off like few Broadway shows have, winning a Grammy Award, a Pulitzer and a spot on the Billboard 200 charts.\nWhy we love 'Hamilton' \nHaving already broke the 15-nomination record held by 2001's \"The Producers,\" \"Hamilton\" is now poised to break that show's record 12 wins.

It is a common procedure in the region known as female genital mutilation (FGM). The practice has been illegal in Egypt since 2008 but remains a strong tradition in Egyptian society where families see\n cutting as a way to \"calm\" or \"purify\" young girls.\nThe initial results of an autopsy performed on the girl cite blood clotting as the possible cause of death, according to Abdel-Samee. El Canal National Hospital, the facility that carried out the banned procedure, was shut down by authorities after Mousa's death and the case is currently under investigation by state prosecutors, Abdel-Samee said. \n\"We have been vigilant in monitoring for these cases and we have increased our focus. But we have not seen anything like this in recent months,\" Abdel-Samee said. \"This is a very dangerous and bad practice that must end.\"\nNinety-two percent of married Egyptian women aged 15 to 49 have been subjected to FGM, according to a recent government report. Even more alarmingly, 82% of female circumcisions in Egypt are performed by trained medical personnel, the United Nations reports. \nMousa's mother, who is a nurse at the same hospital, denied to authorities that her daughter underwent FGM and says she was at the hospital for a different operation, according to  Abdel-Samee. The incident was discovered by a health inspector who was called to check on the girl's death and found, after closer evaluation, that medical staff had illegally preformed FGM. \n\"This is part of the tragedy,\" Abdel-Samee said. \"May god give her the strength to overcome the passing of her daughter but this is another issue. Parents won't acknowledge or admit this is happening. But it did happen.\"\nThe \nUnited Nations in Egypt was saddened by Mousa's death and condemn the procedure.\n\"There is still a long way to go to eliminate this harmful practice that violates the rights of women and girls,\" the \nU.N. said in a statement. \n\"There is no moral, religious or health reason to cut or mutilate any girl or woman.\"\nFGM has no medical benefits, according to the U.N. and can cause lifelong physical and emotional trauma for the millions of women forced each year to undergo the procedure. But disseminating a clear message against the practice has proven a challenge for the Egyptian government.\nThe National Council of Women, a state body, said in a statement: \"All state institutions must be involved in erasing this hideous practice from the community's memory. The role of all institutions including religious institutions in raising awareness is important.\"\nEfforts to end FGM have resulted in some progress. The percentage of girls aged 15 to 17 who have had the procedure has dropped from 74.4% in 2008 to 61% in 2014,\n according to the Egyptian Ministry of Health.\nIn January of last year a doctor was sentenced on charges related to mutilating a girl -- the first conviction of its kind since the 2008 ban went into effect. But rights campaigners tell CNN that enforcement is difficult and does not address the often collective acceptance of FGM in some communities.\n\"Criminalization isn't enough,\" said Dalia Abdelhameed, the gender and women's rights officer at the Egypt-based Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \"The national campaigns have to confront the root causes that propel the families to circumcise their daughters in hopes of controlling their sexual desires.\"", "Baby born without skull in the back of his head defies odds": "Instead of clothes, they were picking out a casket.

He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2006 and retired from the football field in 2013. Ten years after his diagnosis, Horton died surrounded by his two daughters and his wife\n.\nDon Horton was a \ndad to hundreds of college football players\n. Though he wasn't a head coach, numerous players say Horton changed their lives. It's the time he spent with them and how he got to know them that have led some of them to his side as he faced the end of his illness.\nFormer players rally around football coach in final battle with Parkinson's\n\"With Coach Horton, it was the way he made us feel outside the meeting rooms and practice fields,\" said former Cleveland Browns offensive lineman Paul Zukauskas. \"He was a guy that could be tough as a coach, but he'd ask how your family was doing. He really took the time to get to know everybody.\"\nWhen Zukauskas, now a high school football coach in Massachusetts, learned of Horton's illness, he called the coach's wife, Maura Horton, to see how he could help.\nZukauskas, Ricky Brown and Al Washington, all former players from Boston College, set up a \nGoFundMe page\n in April to raise money for hospital expenses and an education fund for Horton's two daughters. As of Wednesday, the fund had raised more than $42,000 for the family.\nAtlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive lineman Gosder Cherilus and former New York Giants defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka are among Horton's former players who have donated to the cause.\n\"He would be very proud of these young men for helping take care of his girls,\" Maura Horton said.\nWhat worries Horton's wife most is whether Libby, 13, and Hadley, 8, will know who their father really was.\nHadley only knew him with this disease. It was his diagnosis that drove the Hortons to \"complete the vision\" of what their family was going to be, his wife said. They sought in vitro fertilization, and Hadley was born.\nTheir struggle with the disease also inspired Maura to make the lives of other Parkinson's patients better.\nOne day, after an NC State game, Horton's limited dexterity prevented him from being able to button his shirt. One of his players, Russell Wilson, now quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, quietly came over to help the coach.\nThe story left Horton embarrassed, but it inspired his wife to create \nMagnaReady\n, a line of shirts with magnetic buttons for people with disabilities.\nCoach with Parkinson's inspires on and off the field\nIn addition to her work as the MagnaReady CEO and fighting to raise Parkinson's awareness, Maura Horton is fighting to keep the memory of her husband alive for her girls.\n\"We keep saying over and over we're going to be all right. I'm not letting in, because it'll just be me single parenting. I'm not going to give in,\" the 46-year-old said between tears.\n\"They need to be who they are going to be but with the values that Don wanted them to have: education and perseverance.\"\nWhen Horton went into a hospice home on May 15, family friend Melanie Walker offered a way for the girls to remember their father forever. She asked friends, family and former players to write letters to Horton's daughters, sharing their favorite memories of the coach.\nA dozen or so former players sent the family letters describing what the coach meant to each of them.\n\"In a football world where players are treated as numbers, you treated us as people, and stood out,\" wrote Ryan Utzler, former running back at Boston College.\nOne of the most emotional letters came from former Boston College player DuJuan Daniels, a national scout for the New England Patriots.\nDaniels wrote about how Horton came to his high school in Indiana to meet him and how he later helped ease the player's cross-country move to North Carolina.\n\"When I sat down with your dad that day at my school, I knew he was the coach that I wanted to follow,\" he wrote to Horton's daughters.\nFootball wasn't the only thing Horton cared about, he added: \"He cared about school, he cared about your family, he cared about you, the kid he was welcoming into his family.\n\"I knew he would look after me, just like he promised my mom, sister and grandmother he would with me being hundreds and hundreds of miles away from the only place I had ever known,\" Daniels wrote.\nDaniels said he felt safe and cared for. Many of the letters noted the same thing and suggested why: Horton believed in his players, or his men, as he called them.\nWhen Daniels suffered a career-ending knee injury years later, Horton was there to support him, he said. The coach offered him career advice and treated him like \"part of his family.\"\nEven after they parted ways, Daniels wrote, Horton called him twice a month in the 14 years that passed since his last game at Boston College.\n\"I can assure you that your dad, Don Horton, had a heart of solid gold. You two, along with your mom, Maura, are forever entrenched in it,\" Daniels wrote.\n\"I am happy to call you two my 'little sisters.' \"\nHorton's wife hopes his legacy will be a lasting one, for their daughters and the world. \n\"People can make such a difference in such a short time in life,\" she said. \"I feel very protective of the girls, and I want them to know how loved they were and how special he was, to be able to be those kind of human beings that will change the world, too.\"\nIf you knew Horton or want to share a message, the family asks that you email walkermp@me.com.", "The 'know thyself' weight loss resolution": "The sales were meant to subsidize my cash-strapped school and fund basic supplies, books and the occasional field trip. But the sales incentive for myself and other students was not supporting education. It was the prizes.\nBrochures displaying shiny toys and games were handed out at an annual, \"Music Man\"-esque assembly led by a representative of the fundraising company. If you sold, say, 50 bars, you picked from the first tier of prizes, such as a simple bike lock. Sell 100 bars and you had a nicer set of prizes from which to choose. And so on, until the top layer with the big prizes, such as a bike.\nThe motivating interests of students, the school and our patrons were different, but aligned. The school got its money, the public got its chocolate, and we got our toys. \nThis scheme works with little kids too. Stickers and prizes for good behavior, potty training, what have you. They may be motivated by the reward, but they doubly benefit from establishing a new habit.\nI needed to start a new habit and thought I'd try to reward myself with prizes if I was successful. \nThe real incentive versus the virtuous wrong one\nAfter years of calorie counting, of exercise regimes, of flirting with diets and food restrictions, I had an epiphany three years ago that being more fit was simply not enough of a motivation for me to make a change.\nI thought I wanted to be trim so badly that I could stick to some diet and exercise plan to get there, but it turns out I want ice cream, bagels and movie popcorn more than I wanted to shed the extra 30 pounds I was carrying.\nThen I remembered the chocolate bar scheme. What do I want more than a general desire to lose weight (and also more than cheesecake)? Prizes! Gifts for me that I won't simply buy for myself, and that no one else even knows I want.\nThe next part was the most fun. In the days leading up to New Year's, I made a list of things I really want, ranging from a bottle of the Belgian beer Chimay to a Brompton folding bike, with a lot of nostalgic childhood toys and ski gear in between. I broke them down (by cost) into six levels that corresponded with weight ranges. I \nmade a PowerPoint brochure\n so I could see them all together. \nI decided that if I weighed between 212 and 208 pounds by the end of the year, I earned a Level 1 prize; between 207 and 203 pounds, I earned Level 2; and so on. Level 6 was the highest healthy weight loss I could sustain. There, along with the folding bike, awaited a fully kitted Millennium Falcon toy I had pined for as a child. \nUnlike the chocolate bar prizes of my youth, in which the organizers had to guess at a wide range of prizes to appeal to different tastes and desires, every item on my personal chart was something I really wanted. \nFinally, I marked up a piece of graph paper that labeled the levels across 52 columns for a weekly weigh-in over the year. The whole process was creative and fun.\nThe inverted New Year's resolution\nAfter enough times on the scale, I became very attuned to fluctuations of my weight. I understood exactly how a 3-mile run, or conversely, an almond croissant, would affect the number. Recent research has shown that \nwhen it comes to diets, one size does not fit all anyway.\nThere was no need to restrict any foods or track calories. I just had to hone this gestalt awareness of my actions. I never stopped consuming doughnuts, pizza and beer, I just got increasingly proficient at making it all come out in the wash.\nI also discovered, a few months in, that a year is a long time to wait, so I tweaked the system. I added another incentive layer to help week to week: earning trips to the movies and new books. If I found myself tempted to have a peanut butter-filled cupcake that someone nicely (cruelly?) brought into the office to share, I would turn my attention to the book or movie I could buy or see at the end of the week.\nThis phenomenon -- of incentivizing a good behavior with a reward -- is known as the \"Happy Meal effect\" by researchers who have studied how money can effectively incentivize people to quit smoking, lose weight and make other behavior changes. In one study, published in the \nJournal of Experimental Psychology: Applied\n, people were simply offered the chance to win gift cards in return for eating only half of their lunch (a \"high-end bacon-avocado sandwich\"). As many as 89% were happy to make the trade.\nThe main incentive for me was still the big, end-of-year Happy Meal prize. And this was another thing I realized about the effectiveness of this experiment: Unlike \nmost New Year's resolutions\n -- the majority of which are abandoned by summer, and almost all of which (92%) don't last through December -- my year-end goal kept me more committed as the year progressed, not less. I didn't starve myself at Christmastime for my final December 31 weigh-in, but I didn't binge on peppermint bark chocolate and eggnog either. \nAt the end of the first year, I weighed 25 pounds less than I did at the beginning, bringing me in at Level 4. I bought a beloved vintage toy from my youth on eBay: an 8-track cassette-fueled trivia \n\"robot\" called 2-XL\n. It was my \"Rosebud.\"\nIncentivizing maintenance \nHaving lost the majority of what I wanted to lose, I needed my system to reward keeping it off. By not making the goal the number of pounds shed, but rather weight range, I began the second year already at Level 4. Even if I just maintained this new, lower weight at the end of year two, I would earn a similar prize.\nAnd so, in my second year, I fluctuated a bit and ended the next December five pounds lighter at Level 5. I bought myself an iPad.\nTo help combat the fluctuations of the previous year, for this, my third, I decided to give myself two additional prizes: one mid-year, to keep me focused in the summer, and another that rewarded the number of weeks I remained below a new weight I'm trying to maintain. It worked. The number on the scale has been more consistent, thanks in part to my mid-year Level 4 prize of a high-end coffee grinder.\nAnd as I approach the end of the third year, I'm doing OK. Level 5 might be a stretch, but if I didn't have my incentive program in place, I'd be dunking a cruller in a mocha latte while writing about something else right now.\nThe point of sharing this system isn't for you to replicate my experiment. It may not work for you, especially if you simply buy things you want. The point is to get you to think about applying the general principle of incentivizing a behavior in which the intrinsic reward is not enough of a motivation. Find a motivator, and even if it's different from your intended goal, it can help you reach it.\nIf you hate to exercise, maybe you can find ways to make it so much fun you don't think of it as a workout, like taking a fitness class with friends or joining a sport so that socializing is the real incentive. If you're trying to quit a bad habit, maybe you reward yourself with other, less harmful or addicting indulgences after increasingly longer abstentions.\nThere's always something you want, right? Can you figure out how to give that to yourself to incentivize a behavior you can't otherwise master for its own sake? If so, you'll indubitably find the experience, uh, rewarding.", "Face transplant patient speaks out five years later": "\"I feel just as healthy as I did when I was 21, and I feel great,\" said Hunter in an interview with \nCNN Indianapolis affiliate WISH\n. \"It's a lot easier going out in public. I don't get the stares. I'm just another face in the crowd, and that's all I ever wanted.\"\nHunter suffered significant injuries in a 2001 car accident, in which he was zapped for about five minutes with 10,000 volts of electricity. The shock cost him his leg and face. Although a terrible accident, Hunter doesn't dwell on the negative effects. \n\"I look back on it as something that made me stronger,\" he said. \"I mean, yeah I would like to have my leg and my face back, but without that happening, I wouldn't be who I am today.\"\nHunter, now 35, is the second full-face transplant recipient in the United States.

The building is being excavated to make room for a conference center.\nTypically bodies from this period would be merely skeletons, but the hearts were well preserved in lead heart-shaped urns. The hearts were sometimes \nburied separate\n from the bodies in medieval Europe. Some scholars think this process started  to preserve corpses if they needed to be transported over a long distance. Separate burial of the heart and the intestines became more common for French and English aristocratic families from the 12th century onward. The Pope banned these burials in 1299 and 1300, causing the tradition to decline in England, but in France the difficulty of getting the Pope's special permission to divide a corpse made it an \n\"even more desirable practice\" \nfor wealthy families, according to a 2010 scholarly book on burial practices. \nThe lead urns containing the hearts in Rennes were labeled with names, so scholars may one day know more about who these people were. As of now, they only know more detail about one of the hearts, which belonged to the husband of a wealthy noblewoman whose exceptionally well preserved body was discovered and examined during the excavation. \nWhen the archaeologists found these hearts' urns, they called in modern-day radiologists to take a closer look.\nUsing a CT scan and an MRI the scientists were able to get decent images of the hearts, but the organs had been embalmed. The embalming process made it difficult to learn much about the health of the hearts.\nResearchers were allowed to clean the hearts and then carefully remove the embalming materials to see if they could get a better sense of the people's health condition at death. Once the hearts were rehydrated, the doctors were able to use an MRI to get better images of the tissue. They were also able to dissect the hearts and take samples.\nThey discovered the majority showed signs of disease. One heart was in bad shape and could not be examined further. Another was found to be healthy, but three others had plaque on the coronary arteries, one of the hearts \nwas enlarged\n, and another was heavy, meaning each of these three had heart disease.\n\"They were really pathological,\" said \nFatima-Zohra Mokrane\n a radiologist at the University Hospital of Toulouse who presented the research at the Radiological Society of North America conference. \nForensic scientist \nDr. Fabrice Dedouit\n, who also worked on the research and also helped do the examination of the preserved noblewoman's body, said the opportunity to work with tissue from this era is \"very rare.\" \n\"At the beginning it was a surprise when we opened the lead cases. We didn't know precisely what were inside the urns,\" Dedouit said. \"It was, in fact, really really exceptional material for us to study. You had a sensation of elasticity that was completely amazing. It is as if these people had recently died, rather than these being 500-year-old hearts.\"\nThis is not the first research to show that our ancestors had heart disease. \nA 2011 study \nfound atherosclerosis in ancient Egyptian mummies. Unlike the Rennes hearts, researchers were unable to rehydrate the organs.\n\"Museums don't take too kindly to that idea,\" said Dr. Gregory Thomas, co-author of the study. \nThomas \nis the medical director of the MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Long Beach Memorial in California. After examining 52 ancient Egyptian mummies and finding 20 of the 44  that had cardiovascular structures had atherosclerosis or signs of it, he said he came away with an important takeaway from this kind of work. \n\"I think the lesson learned is that humans are inherently at risk for heart disease whether they live in ancient Egypt or North or South America or Europe,\" Thomas said. \"I don't look at it as our fate is to die of heart disease, I look at this as a lesson that we humans have had this challenge from the beginning of time, but we can prevent or delay it. And we should use this as a reminder that we should do everything we currently know how to delay it: exercise, a lean diet, avoid smoking, taking medication that we need.\"\nIt's a lesson for the ages.", "NASA's Kepler discovers 1,284 planets": "\"Kepler is the first telescope for detecting small rocky planets in the habitable zone of their stars,\" said Paul Hertz, Astrophysics Division director at NASA. \"Thanks to Kepler, we know exoplanets are common, most stars in our galaxy have planetary systems and they are potentially habitable planets. Knowing this is the first step to addressing whether are we alone in the universe.\"\nSince launching in 2009, Kepler has been watching more than 150,000 stars in one part of the sky to determine exoplanet candidates, based on the slight dimming of stars as potential planets pass across them. \nThe goal has been to discover more Earth-like planets, or goldilocks, in the habitable zone, where water can pool on the surface of a planet. They are usually 1.6 times the size of Earth with rocky terrain. Of these newly discovered planets, nine orbit in the habitable zone of their star and nearly 550 are possibly rocky planets roughly around the same size as Earth. The discovery of these nine planets contributes to 21 exoplanets in the habitable zone \"hall of fame.\" \nTo verify whether a candidate could be confirmed as a planet, scientists used a time-consuming, in-depth process analyzing each one, often using ground-based telescopes or radial velocity to determine mass. This also required resource-intensive follow-up observation. Candidates are prone to creating astrophysical false positives, or imposter scenarios, creating hope for a planet when it was actually something else.\nMorton discovered he could use Kepler's current catalog of planets and statistical analysis to assign a planet-hood probability percentage to each candidate found by Kepler. This way, scientists could determine a way to quantify the probability that a signal is in fact a planet without follow-up observation. \nThe simulations create detailed shapes of transit signals attributed to planets and imposters and how common imposters are in the Milky Way galaxy. Combining the two simulations provides a reliability score between 0 and 1. Anything greater than 99% is a \"validated planet.\"\nCompared with previous techniques, this is fully automated and can be applied to all candidates at once, only taking a few minutes per candidate to do the calculation. \n\"Planet candidates can be thought of like bread crumbs,\" said Morton. \"If you drop a few large crumbs on the floor, you can pick them up one by one. But, if you spill a whole bag of tiny crumbs, you're going to need a broom. This statistical analysis is our broom.\"\nThe current Kepler catalog included 4,302 potential planets. In addition to the 1,284 confirmed planets, 1,327 are most likely planets but require further study and 707 are potential imposters. This analysis also validated 984 candidates previously verified using ground telescopes or other methods. \n\"When Kepler first started, we thought false positives were really common,\" Morton said. \"I came to studying this problem with a fresh perspective and clear vision. By applying a new method, we've created a paradigm shift.\"\nThe Kepler mission will end in October 2017. The team has until then to produce a final discovery catalog and quantify scaling for identifying exoplanets, as well as leaving data measurements for the scientific community as a way to pass the baton on to future missions, said Natalie Batalha, Kepler mission scientist. \nThese other missions -- like TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, in 2017 and the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018 -- will continue the search for life beyond Earth. \nCompared to Kepler, TESS will use a similar transit method for observing planets, when they pass in front of their parent stars. While Kepler looked at one portion of the sky for stars that were further away for a longer time, TESS will observe the entire sky and focus on the brightest and closest stars, each for 30 days. \nThe James Webb Space Telescope is capable of observing large exoplanets and detecting starlight filtered through their atmosphere, which will enable scientists to determine the atmospheric composition and analyze them for gases that can create a biological ecosystem. \nThe K2 mission, which launched in 2014, is extending Kepler's legacy to new parts of the sky and new fields of study, adding to NASA's \"arc of discovery.\" It has enough fuel to keep identifying candidates until summer 2018. It is helping  bridge the gap between Kepler and TESS as far as identifying targets for the James Webb Space Telescope to observe. \nSo, just how many exoplanets do we estimate are out there in the galaxy for NASA to study and discover? Tens of billions of Earth-sized habitable planets, Batalha said.  In the future, NASA wants to increase its understanding from the habitable zone to habitable environments and living worlds. \n\"With this discovery, we're going to change the way we see the universe,\" Batalha said. \"You'll  look up at the sky and see pinpoints of light and think of them as planetary systems, not just stars. We're going to know how life manifests itself in the galaxy.\"", "Pigeons, the next great cancer detector?": "It turns out pigeons may make great cancer detectives.\nIt's unlikely that you'll see a \"Pigeons at Work\" sign at the hospital radiology or pathology department anytime soon, but the authors of \na new study in the journal PLOS ONE\n think the birds offer great potential as testers of cancer detection technology and as a help in doctor training.\nRelated: Pigeon caught flying drug into prison\nEvolutionarily speaking, birds' and humans' last common ancestor lived \nabout 310 million years ago\n, but pigeons' vision is as effective as that of humans, if not better. The birds can see more wavelengths of light than we can, including ultraviolet light. And that's impressive when you know that their brains are about one-thousandth the size of ours. \nEarlier studies have shown pigeons can use visual cues to \nput objects into categories\n, they can \ndifferentiate between letters\n of the alphabet, and they can \nrecognize you\n even if you change clothes. (Maybe it really is personal if your car, or head, is a target for droppings.)\nHearing about this amazing visual recall on a radio segment, \nDr. Richard Levenson\n wondered, out of a kind of \"intellectual playfulness,\" if he could harness that pigeon power for good. Levenson is a professor and vice chair for strategic technologies in the department of medical pathology and laboratory medicine at University of California-Davis Medical Center. He wondered \"if they could actually do pathology, which is all about visual recall,\" Levenson said.\nIn other words, would the proverbial \"rat with wings\" make a good lab rat with wings? Did the birds have enough of an eagle -- er, pigeon eye to detect cancer in tissue samples?\nHe got in touch with \nDr. Ed Wasserman\n, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Iowa. He is also one of the guys scientists flock to when they want to play with pigeon vision.\nThe collaboration was a success. \"It worked spectacularly well,\" Levenson said. \"In fact, Ed (Wasserman) said that the pigeons responded to this visual challenge as well, or better than many other tests.\" \nFor the experiment, eight birds were placed in a high-tech box in which they were shown an image a scientist would see under the microscope, along with two boxes. The slides showed relatively straightforward images of cancer cells, and cells that are not cancerous, from actual breast tissue samples. The scientists trained the birds to peck at one box if the sample was malignant, the other if it was benign. The birds trained with 144 images at different magnifications and each got a pellet when it pecked at the box with the right answer.\n \nOver 15 training days the birds were able to tell the difference, even with images they hadn't seen before. The pigeons showed \"remarkable\" success, getting the right answer 85% of the time. The birds did better with color images than black and white, but when the birds did a little \"flocksourcing\" and worked together to identify the images, their accuracy rose significantly.\nThe birds didn't do as well classifying suspicious mammographic densities or masses. In that case birds mostly memorized and weren't as successful identifying the novel cases. Inexperienced human students may also struggle with these same images.\nRelated: Key to racing pigeons is motivation\nThe difficulty does not surprise \nDr. Debra Monticciolo,\n chairwoman of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Commission. \"Unlike looking at the heart or lungs, which look pretty much the same (in all patients), what makes this field incredibly difficult is that every woman's breast looks different based on different patterns of fat and density patterns,\" Monticciolo said. \"That's why it takes many years' experience to do this kind of work and why people get better at it the more images they study.\"\nRelated: UK spies unable to crack coded pigeon message\nWith medical school, four years of radiology training and residency on top of that, a radiologist will have seen hundreds of thousands of cases before he or she is licensed to make what may be a life-or-death cancer diagnosis. \nSo Monticciolo doesn't expect to share her lab with pigeons any time soon, \"although they would have an advantage since they work for peanuts,\" she joked. She said she appreciates this \"innovative study,\" not just because she recently came back from a birding trip in Brazil.\nLevenson and his co-authors are not proposing pigeons replace human experts. But the authors do wonder if pigeons may someday be used \nthe way computer algorithms are used today\n in testing new medical diagnostic technology, as a substitute for expensive human testers in the early stages of development.\nAlso, if pigeons consistently miss the same things, maybe humans in training would too. Levenson wonders if textbook authors could use pigeons to determine which images are trickier and include more of those images to boost training.  \nAnd on a grander scale, he added, perhaps knowing the good work pigeons are capable of will improve their public relations image. Instead of cursing them as a nuisance, maybe people will appreciate them for their hidden talents.\n\"What is going on inside their brain is not nearly as crude as people think,\" Levenson said. \"They may in fact have a rich inner life.\" ", "What's in your pad or tampon?": "In fact, tampon-like devices have been used since ancient Rome, where women fashioned devices out of wool to absorb menstrual flow. Rolls of grass were used in parts of Africa, and Hawaiian women used ferns. \nBut what is actually in a modern-day tampon and pads? \nGenerally, tampons are blends of cotton and rayon, along with synthetic fibers, but each manufacturer's products are different and considered proprietary.  \nConsumer groups in the United States have been wanting to know more since the 1980s. A growing environmental movement and awareness about toxic shock syndrome prompted women to ask what was in these products because manufacturers weren't required to fully disclose what goes into a tampon or pad. That's because they are regulated and approved as medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration and full disclosure is not required.\nDemocratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York has \nintroduced legislation nine times\n since 1997 that would require manufacturers to be more transparent and disclose the complete makeup of tampons, pads, and other feminine hygiene products. She wants companies to clearly label not only the fabrics used, but also any contaminants, fragrances, colorants, dyes and preservatives. Her bill directs the National Institutes of Health to look at the health effects of these products, because, she says, there is little research in this area.\nBut her bill has failed to move beyond the floor, every time.\nDemands for more transparency\nLast month, members of the consumer group \nWomen's Voices for the Earth\n dressed up as boxes of tampons and pads and protested in front of Procter & Gamble's corporate headquarters. They held up signs that said, \"My uterus loves accurate labels.\"\nAccording to market research group Euroshare, P&G is  the largest manufacturers of feminine products, with 44% of the United States market share. Women's Voices for the Earth wants manufacturers such as P&G to fully disclose what goes into tampons, sanitary pads and wipes.\n\"Our concerns of the care products ... was out of the lack of ingredient disclosure,\" said Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research for Women's Voices for the Earth. The group has been leading a two-year campaign it calls \n\"Detox the Box.\n\"\nWhen \nthe group tested\n P&G's Always pads, it found the sanitary napkins emitted chemicals, like styrene, chloroethane and chloroform. The World Health Organization classifies styrene as a carcinogen. And the EPA says short-term exposure to high concentrations of chloromethane can have neurological effects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says high levels of exposure to chloroethane can result in lack of muscle coordination and unconsciousness.  \nHowever, all the levels are accpetable under federal regulations. In a statement, Women's Voices for the Earth said, \"While the levels of the toxic chemicals emitted by Always pads were relatively low, their presence warrants health concerns for women.\"\nTonia Elrod, a P&G spokeswoman, said the company hasn't seen the complete study, but pointed out that these are naturally occurring chemicals found in the ambient air, and that the study did not measure the composition in their product.\nTucker Helmes, executive director of the\n Center for Baby and Adult Hygiene Products,\n an industry trade group, said there should be no concern about these chemicals. \"There is more styrene in strawberries than there is in the air sample they measured in this study,\" said Helmes. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the industry, reviews all designs and materials.  In May, the organization addressed concerns, responding to Internet allegations, which alleged that tampons are contaminated by asbestos and dioxin, which can lead to toxic shock syndrome. \nThe agency said, \"The available scientific evidence does not support these rumors.\"\nManufacturers release more information\nIn the past few weeks, both \nP&G\n, maker of \nAlways\n pads and \nTampax \ntampons, and \nKimberly-Clark\n, maker of \nKotex\n tampons and pads, \nhave published\n additional information \non their websites\n. \nBut microbiologist \nPhilip Tierno of the New York University School of Medicine\n said that's not enough. \"Even if they list some ingredients, they may not be listing all of them.\" \nTierno was one of the scientists who helped discover the link between \ntoxic shock syndrome and tampons\n in the 1980s. He connected TSS to the synthetic materials that were used in superabsorbent tampons at the time.\nThe FDA says those synthetic products are no longer used in tampons sold in the United States.\n\"Those fibers amplified the bacteria staph, if a toxigenic strain was present,\" Tierno said. About \n20% of people \nnaturally have the bacteria staph.  At the height of the TSS scare in 1980, there were\n 890 cases \nreported to the CDC.\nAccording to voluntary reports to the CDC, the number of TSS cases since 1998 has \nvaried between 138 to as low as 65\n in 2012.\nBut Tierno said there are still products using viscose rayon, which he called \"the best of the four bad ingredients.\" \n'A lot of dioxin'\nRayon is a synthetic made from sawdust and a byproduct of it is dioxin, which the EPA says is likely carcinogenic. \nThe FDA says\n that trace amounts of dioxin are not of concern for human health and that rayon tampons don't have higher incidences of TSS. \n\"Sure, one tampon is trace,\" said Tierno, \"but consider the menstrual lifetime of a woman. They use approximately 12,000 tampons in a lifetime. That means 12,000 exposures of dioxin ... five, six, seven times a day. That's a lot of dioxin absorbed directly through the vagina. It goes directly into the blood.\" \n\"Vaginal tissue isn't like other skin. It's covered in mucous membranes, it's very permeable. It's a direct route to your reproductive organs. We need to be really careful of these products,\" said Scranton, of Women's Voices for the Earth. \nBob Brand, spokesperson for Kimberly-Clark, said \"Kimberly-Clark's U by Kotex tampons are manufactured by a process that is both chlorine and dioxin-free. However, since dioxins can be found in the environment, Kimberly-Clark regularly tests for dioxins to ensure the safety of our products.\"  P&G said it also used a similar process.\nAnd while companies are required to track their dioxin levels, neither company would offer to make those measurements public when asked. \n'Our products are safe'\n\"Our member companies take into consideration lifetime use of these products, the materials they are made from, and the body areas they contact as part of their rigorous safety assessments,\" said Helmes of the industry trade group. \nBut what may be of greater concern, said both Tierno and Scranton, are ingredients like \"superabsorbent foam,\" found in pads, or \"fragrance\" that doesn't list any other details. \n\"We want to know what 'flexfoam' is made of. Is it rayon or cotton or both? What are the 'fiber finishes'?\" asked Scranton.\n\"Every single product contained in a tampon has to be researched. We already know the fibers contain dozens (of chemicals), polyester contains hundreds of chemicals. It's not just a fiber you put in the vaginal vault,\" said Tierno. \nAnd the concern is not just for TSS, they say, but for adverse and allergic reactions. The FDA does catalog such complaints. Since 2014, there have been \n270 claims made about tampons\n, and \n12 claims about pads\n.\nThe complaints allege everything from TSS to the products breaking apart to allergic reactions. \nElrod of Proctor & Gamble stated plainly, \"Our products are safe. That's the foundation of everything that we do. We're working with university scientists, FDA. Women can use our products safely.\"\nBrand of Kimberly-Clark said \"Nothing is of greater concern to Kimberly-Clark than the quality of our products and the well-being of the consumers who use them. \" \nThe FDA says women should choose a tampon with the minimum absorbency they need, and should consult their doctors.\nThe FDA requires manufacturers to provide labeling on packaging about the signs of TSS, and how to minimize risk.", "Beating heroin is more than 12 steps; it's 18 years and going": " \"What would I do with my life?\" This continues to be a question. There are two parts to recovery: There is the ceasing of the use and abuse of chemicals. Then, the more difficult process for a person like myself: creating a whole new life. I had fallen so far to the bottom, where would I start?  After spending eight years of my life on heroin, what are the steps I need to take to rebuild my life and my sanity?\nI was told many things in early recovery: everything from \"don't get into a relationships\" to \"work the 12 steps or die.\"  I have found that the truth is more nuanced.  \nMy recovery process began even before the last time I used drugs. I had made a silent promise to myself that if the opportunity arose, I would take it. I would try to get clean. This attempt would be a sincere one. I had tried 10 other times but was unable to last beyond a few months, then a few weeks, then a few days. Then, finally, I could go no longer than a day without drugs. \nWhen the police clicked the handcuffs on my wrists, I breathed a sigh of relief. Instead of blaming the world for my situation, I was ready to take an active role in my life. I had deferred these decisions to drugs for so long, the idea of \"recovery\" was a frightening one. Yet I knew it was one I had to attempt. The alternative was dying as a Jane Doe with a needle hanging out of my arm or getting my throat cut in some sleazy hotel room. \nThe waves of fear rolled over me in those first few months. The first thing I needed to address was my poor physical condition. I was underweight, covered in soft tissue infections and possibly infected with HIV. After waiting nearly a week for an answer, I had made up my mind that I was going to stay clean. When the test was negative, it merely strengthened my resolve. \nThe first few months, I found it difficult to sleep at night. This alternated with periods of absolutely no energy, known as PAWS, or post-acute withdrawal syndrome. I continued to attend group support meetings, but many days, I felt as if things were completely hopeless. How could a person like me ever stay off drugs? How would I support myself? How could I explain to any \"normal\" person my former life on the streets of San Francisco? The homelessness, prostitution and years spent injecting myself with drugs were hard for me to understand. \nSlowly, incrementally, I began to see the changes. I began to feel better physically, until one day, I could finally enjoy a warm shower and the food from the commissary. I had the smallest bit of gratitude, enough to push me to the next phase of my recovery. \nI was transferred to a residential treatment facility. This was overwhelming to me. It was large, almost a warehouse for users. There were 100 beds and nearly eight men per female resident. I wasn't sure how to navigate social situations. The extent of my conversations for close to a decade had centered around my ability to acquire drugs. I was seated next to people who attempted to engage me in conversations. \nI quickly found that many people were not, in fact, there for \"recovery.\" They wanted to get off parole, had no place to live or were forced there by family members. \nIn and out: An addiction journey\nMany of the male residents gave me validation around my appearance, validation that was inappropriate for the setting. I was completely unaware of this because I had the selective hearing that comes with years of addiction, hearing what I wanted to hear. \nAfter making the mistake of having sex with a male resident, I made another decision to focus on myself. While many people could return home if they didn't complete treatment, my options consisted of jail or living in an alleyway. I wanted more for myself. I began to open up in groups and to counselors. I got my first \"chip,\" celebrating lengths of recovery. I had six months without using drugs. \nWhen it was time to leave the program, my process did not stop there. In reality, it was the beginning. Now, I had to live \"life on life's terms.\" I had a job, bills and stress. I noticed I was having flashbacks to violence I had endured. I was having nightmares. I felt afraid to be around loud noises and crowded rooms. \nI was encouraged to see a therapist. I had rejected the idea outright many times until I got desperate enough to give it a try. \"The person is paid to objectively listen to you,\" someone told me. I needed that: someone outside my daily life to listen to me. \nI was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. I had not escaped those years of addiction unscathed. My mind and spirit needed to heal, not just my physical self. I began to open up about my experiences to others. I found that many people had similar experiences. I wasn't crazy or broken; I just needed to heal. \nThere seems to be no place or person that has not been impacted by the opioid \"epidemic\" sweeping the United States. On a daily basis, people who are struggling with opioids contact me for insight. I assure them that recovery is possible. There is hope after heroin. \nFebruary 27 marked 18 years for me as a recovering person. Recovery is a process. It isn't a place; it is a journey. It isn't a sprint; it is a marathon. It is a lifelong commitment to taking care of yourself. \nMy entire life has changed. I went from homeless to homeowner. I went from being alone to having a full life with a beautiful family. I went from desperate to fulfilled. It all started with one second, one minute, one hour of knowing I was going to change. By giving up one thing -- drugs -- I gained everything.", "Vietnam, heroin and the lesson of disrupting any addiction": "It was 1971 and U.S. Reps. Robert Steele and Morgan Murphy had just returned from an official visit to Vietnam with news that stunned the American public: 15% of the active soldiers were heroin addicts. Given President Richard Nixon's promises to both end the war in Vietnam and solve the rising domestic crime rate, this news was especially unsettling. \nUnintended consequences: Why painkiller addicts turn to heroin\nAs a result, Operation Golden Flow was born.\nIt is what it sounds like. American soldiers in Vietnam would not be permitted to board a plane home until they passed a urine drug test. If they failed, the soldiers would be forced to stay in Vietnam, detox and try again. The expectations were low, given the extraordinary \naddictiveness\n of heroin. It was already thought to be the most addictive substance ever produced and impossible to escape.\nWhy is heroin so addictive?\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins were wondering the same thing, right around the same time. In 1972, they stumbled onto an unexpected explanation. They discovered the brains of humans contained naturally occurring receptors for opium. The implications of this were significant. It meant substances such as codeine, morphine and heroin had a natural landing spot in the brain. When ingested, they would light up something primitive deep in our neurons. This is a trait all humans share, evolutionarily.\nHow heroin kills you\nEven more remarkably, they figured out the active ingredients in opium, and all of its derivatives, were nearly identical to chemicals we already have in our brains -- endorphins -- the feel-good stuff giving us a sense of euphoria after we exercise. (They finally had proof a runner's high really was a runner's high!) \nAs a result of their work, we now know endorphins are the natural opiates of the human body. And, like opium, not only did endorphins relieve pain, they made us feel good. Really good. Sometimes addictively good. \nThe problem is, unlike endorphins, opium doesn't require us to exercise to get that good feeling. We could now simply get it through an injection. \nAnd none of the opiates worked faster than heroin. Its chemical structure allowed it to be soluble in fat, and cross the blood brain barrier resulting in a near immediate rush, and subsequent high. \nIt was almost as if it was chemically designed to be addictive, which of course it was.\nFather loses son to addiction, ends up in recovery himself and then ...\nTo make matters worse, frequent users of heroin slowly dampen their brain's feel-good reward centers, known as the nucleus accumbens, which is stimulated by dopamine. When someone takes a substance like heroin, as opposed to relying on natural endorphins, the dopamine surge is more rapid and longer lasting. The problem is the nucleus accumbens can start to become fatigued from such excessive stimulation. The result: An addict needs escalating doses of heroin to get increasingly diminished pleasure. \nIn addition, a heroin user would now have a reward center in the brain with very low levels of baseline activity. So when they weren't using heroin, they crashed and hard -- which helped explain the dramatic highs and lows of the heroin addicts brain. \nFor all these reasons, heroin became scientifically regarded as one of the most dangerously addictive drugs on the planet, in terms of dependence, withdrawal, tolerance, reinforcement and intoxication. Relapse is almost guaranteed, and heroin use is now intensifying dramatically, even in previously unexpected populations. Some of the greatest increases are occurring in higher income women and overdose deaths from opiates have quadrupled over the past 10 years, \naccording to the Centers for Disease Control\n. \nAddiction and your environment\nBack in 1971, during Operation Golden Flow, it was becoming increasingly clear addiction was a brain disease and that an individual's biology, along with the genes he or she was born with, accounted for about half of their addiction vulnerability. But the other half was more complicated, a product of their environment and its interplay with genetics. \nThis is where Operation Gold Rush would provide some startling insights. One thing was clear: The soldiers returning from Vietnam were about to undergo a dramatic transformation in their environment.\nIn Vietnam, not only was the location and culture wildly different than what the soldiers would experience back in the United States, they would also no longer endure the psychological whiplash of stagnant boredom and atrocious horror characterizing a battlefield. They would be reimmersed in a more mundane civilian life. That fact alone would tremendously impact their success in overcoming addiction.\nAstonishingly, only 5% of the men who returned home after becoming addicted in Vietnam relapsed within a year. Just 12% relapsed, even briefly, within three years. It was astonishing because, on average, 78% of those admitted for heroin use had been in treatment at least once before, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThere had never been a recovery program in history leading to the sort of success seen during Operation Gold Rush. For many, disrupting the environment of an addict would become standard in their approach to treatment.\nThanks to the work of psychologists, such as David Neal and Wendy Wood, we know even more about \nhow our environment affects anyone's behavior\n. Walking by a smoking lounge can be torture for a smoker trying to quit, just like strolling by a bar can overwhelm a former alcoholic. The environment alone can be a powerful mental cue, which is irresistible. \nPerhaps, like me, watching television cues you to eat a bowl of popcorn or ice cream. I don't need the ice cream by any means, and didn't even think about it a few minutes earlier, but the combination of environmental factors led me to the freezer. \nLike the soldiers in Vietnam, though, disrupting our own environment can also result in enormous change. It is not that we need to experience war zones and then return home, but it may be changing around the furniture in a room where you are likely to have a drink. As Neal described, if you are going to continue to eat ice cream, \ntry using your left hand if you are right handed\n, or perhaps eat it only while standing up. Slowly these environmental changes may cause you to break the behavioral cue and take a closer look at that cigarette, alcoholic drink and ice cream and fully realize you don't need it. \nOperation Golden Rush helped make clear how this simple concept helped break the heroin addictions of Vietnam. It might help all of us in our daily lives as well.", "Can this pill end the AIDS epidemic?": "Ferrusi said he is HIV-negative and would like to stay that way. He's the kind of person that could be taking Truvada, a once-a-day pill that is nearly as effective as condoms in preventing HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Some doctors and politicians have hailed the antiretroviral drug, known as PrEP, as a key to ending the AIDS epidemic. \n\"You go into a panic that wouldn't be there if I was on PrEP,\" Ferrusi said. \"I'm having a good time and being a good person -- and that comes with a risk sometimes. If I can eliminate those risks by taking PrEP, I think it would be a good idea.\"\nStill, like many others, Ferrusi is grappling with a decision to take the drug as a preventive. When taken as prescribed, PrEP can prevent more than 90% of sexually transmitted HIV infections. So why aren't people jumping on the bandwagon? \nThe end of 'condom culture'?\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada\n \nin 2004 for treating HIV infections. In 2012, it was \napproved as the first\n -- and still, only -- drug for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It works by establishing a presence of the drug in the cells that HIV targets for infection; the virus can't produce a genetic code, so it can't replicate and cause an infection.\nMen who have sex with men account for more than half of the \n1.2 million people living with HIV in the United States\n. \n\"People at high risk who should be offered PrEP include about 1 in 4 sexually active gay and bisexual men, 1 in 5 people who inject drugs and 1 in 200 sexually active heterosexual adults,\" \naccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n.\nBut not everyone is applauding the pill as a major advancement in the fight against HIV and AIDS.\nNo one, at least publicly, is advocating for using PrEP without condoms. Still, it erodes the \"condom culture,\" said AIDS Healthcare Foundation President Michael Weinstein, who is among PrEP's most prominent critics.\n\"If people take this drug, they're not going to use condoms. Let's just be real about it,\" Weinstein said.\n\"The reality is that condoms are 98% effective. So if people use condoms, they don't need to take this pill.\"\nWeinstein said it might be the best choice for people who refuse to use condoms. But for many people, taking the pill as prescribed could be a challenge. Without insurance, the drug can run about $1,500 per month. Many insurance plans, as well as Medicaid, cover it, and the drug's maker, Gilead Sciences, offers assistance for people who can't afford the cost.\n\"The record of people taking pills for every disease is bad,\" Weinstein said. \"I know that personally when I've had to take an antibiotic for 10 days, I'm sure I'm taking it the way I'm supposed to be, and yet I wind up with a bunch of pills in the bottle at the end.\"\nAnother PrEP opponent is longtime activist Larry Kramer, who has been HIV-positive since the late 1980s and takes antiretroviral drugs as treatment. He declined to talk with CNN for this report, but in a 2014 \ninterview with The New York Times\n, Kramer said of its side effects, \"Anybody who voluntarily takes an antiretroviral every day has got to have rocks in their heads.\" \nSide effects of Truvada include gastrointestinal issues, fatigue, headaches and mild itching or skin rash. Some Truvada patients have experienced kidney and liver problems. For that reason, anyone taking the medication to prevent infection must have their blood tested every three months to ensure proper kidney and liver function and to make sure they remain HIV-negative. If someone manages to contract HIV while on PrEP, he or she must switch to a different treatment regimen, so he or she won't build up a resistance to the medication.\n\"There's something, to me, cowardly about taking Truvada instead of using a condom,\" Kramer told the Times. \"You're taking a drug that is poison to you, and it has lessened your energy to fight, to get involved, to do anything.\"\nChanging the psychology of sex\nOthers say the effects of PrEP extend beyond preventing HIV. It can \"revolutionize the psychology of the HIV epidemic,\" said Sarit Golub, a Hunter College professor who has been studying the psychological effects of PrEP for years\nGolub said her research indicates 40% to 60% of gay men report thinking about HIV while they're having sex all or most of the time. She calls that a \"psychological tragedy.\" Her PrEP patients report significant decreases in anxiety, depression and stress, she said.\n\"What PrEP is able to do is separate the act of prevention of HIV from the act of sexual intimacy,\" Golub said. \"And to me, I think that is one of the tremendous powers of PrEP for individuals and for us as a broader community.\"\nDr. Demetre Daskalakis, assistant commissioner of the Bureau of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said that PrEP has the power to change anxiety levels about sex.\n\"For men who have sex with men and who are of a certain age, there has never been a time that they've had sex without having to be very, very worried about HIV constantly,\" said Daskalakis, who played an integral role in the FDA's approval of Truvada for PrEP. \n\"You can plan ahead by saying, 'You know, something is going on in my surroundings that is putting me at risk for HIV, so I'm going to take this really, frankly, brave step in taking a medicine every day to prevent HIV infection.' So it's not really in the heat of the moment, or 'I have to put a condom on right now' or 'Where is my condom?' It just gives you the level of security to acknowledge that risks happen and that some people have risk patterns.\"\nPrEP, Daskalakis said, is not a \"forever intervention.\" It might appeal to someone in the months after a breakup with a longtime, monogamous partner, after a move to a new place or after the discovery of an interest in higher-risk sex acts. It isn't immediate either. It takes seven days to build up the full level of protection of the drug in the immune system, and Daskalakis recommends patients continue taking the prescription for 28 days after the risk has subsided.\nFor individuals who find themselves in a panic after having unsafe sex or after a condom breaks, Daskalakis recommends PEP -- post-exposure prophylaxis.\nWhereas PrEP is an antiretroviral administered consistently, PEP is prescribed as soon as possible (within 72 hours) following a sexual encounter, and the medication must be taken for 28 days.\nPrEP's social stigma\nTruvada has only been on the market as a preventive drug for a few years, but some liken the debate around it to a better-known drug: birth control, when it first went on the market for contraception in the 1960s.\nBirth control protects against unwanted pregnancy but does not protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. While Truvada does protect against HIV, it does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections.\nSome PrEP studies have shown spikes in the rates of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia among the drug's users, while other studies have not. \nThe AIDS Healthcare Foundation's Weinstein sometimes refers to PrEP as a \"party drug,\" one he believes is taken mostly by people who want to have unprotected sex.\nDaskalakis disagrees. \"I'm feeling like I live somewhere in the '60s, talking about contraception and sometimes I can imagine deleting the word 'HIV' and saying 'unwanted pregnancy,' \" he said. \"I think there is a lot of what's called 'slut shaming' in the Truvada story, but it's the exact analogy of what happened in the '60s with birth control. I mean, we've been living 30 years with the dogma that says the only way to be safe -- to prevent HIV infection -- is using condoms or abstinence.\"\nBoth Daskalakis and Golub said the majority of the PrEP users they counsel are responsible men who have sex with men. Like Ferrusi, they want an added safety net if they choose to have sex with someone whose status is unknown or who is HIV-positive.\n\"Our ultimate tagline is that we need to customize people's prevention for what is appropriate for their lifestyle,\" Daskalakis said, whether that means condoms or PrEP.\nLast summer, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo outlined a three-point plan to move the state closer to the end of its AIDS epidemic. The goal: dramatically reduce the number of new HIV infections by 2020 and achieve the first-ever decrease in HIV prevalence in New York since the beginning of the crisis in the '80s.\nThe plan calls for identifying people who are positive and undiagnosed, keeping people in care so they remain healthy and prevent further transmission -- and facilitating access to PrEP for those at high risk.\nAlthough Ferrusi hasn't taken the drug yet, that plan -- \nEnding the AIDS Epidemic\n -- is the campaign on which he now works. He doesn't feel any stigma attached to the drug, he said, and he'll consider taking it in the future.\n\"I'd be very surprised in myself if I didn't go on PrEP within the next year,\" he said. \"I think everything is there, the research is there. I've had friends who use it, and they've had good experiences.\"", "The healthiest ways to cook veggies and boost nutrition": "Oddly enough, that's not likely to be raw. Studies show the process of cooking actually breaks down tough outer layers and cellular structure of many vegetables, making it easier for your body to absorb their nutrients. \nFor example, compared to raw, \"studies found that eating cooked spinach and carrots resulted in higher blood levels of the antioxidant beta carotene, which then converts to vitamin A,\" said registered dietitian Elaine Magee, author of \"Food Synergy: Unleash Hundreds of Powerful Healing Food Combinations to Fight Disease and Live Well.\" \nAnd it's not just limited to vitamins, Magee said. \"Cooking vegetables also helps increase the amount of minerals, like calcium, magnesium and iron, available to the body,\" she said.\nSteam, don't boil\nAs a general rule, it's best to keep cooking time, temperature and the amount of liquid to a minimum. That's why steaming is one of the best ways to cook most vegetables. It turns out that's especially true for broccoli, long touted as one of our \ntop anti-cancer foods\n.\n\"When buying fresh broccoli, look for firm florets with a purple, dark green, or bluish hue on the top,\" Magee said. \"as they are likely to contain more beta carotene and vitamin C than florets with lighter green tops.\" \nA \n2009 study\n prepared broccoli using five popular methods -- boiling, microwaving, steaming, stir-frying and stir-frying/boiling. Researchers found steaming kept the highest level of nutrients.\n\"Boiling vegetables causes water soluble vitamins like vitamin C, B1 and folate to leach into the water,\" Magee said. \"So unless you are going to drink the water along with your vegetables, such as when making soups and stews, these vitamins are typically poured down the sink. Steaming is a gentler way to cook because the vegetables don't come in contact with the boiling water.\"\nAnother 2009 study found peas, cauliflower and zucchini to be particularly susceptible to a loss of nutrients through boiling, losing more than 50% of their antioxidants. \"Water is not the cook's best friend when it comes to preparing vegetables,\"\n the researchers summarized. \nBut what's a rule without exceptions? In this case, it's carrots. Another study showed both \nboiling and steaming\n increased levels of beta carotene. But try to cook carrots whole, as cutting can reduce nutrients by 25%.\nIn fact, cooking veggies whole is often the best choice to preserve nutrients. When that's not practical, be sure to cut them into large uniform pieces that will cook evenly. And wait to wash your vegetables until just before you cut -- washing before storing may promote bacterial growth and speed up spoilage,  Magee said.\nWhen in doubt, microwave \nMicrowaving uses little to no water, and can heat the veggie quickly from within, preserving nutrients such as vitamin C that break down when heated. A \n2003 study\n found significantly higher levels of phytonutrients in zucchini, carrots and beans cooked with minimal water. Phytonutrients are compounds naturally found in plants that provide health benefits and disease protection in the human body.  \nAnother exception: Don't microwave cauliflower. The \n2009 Spanish study\n found the highest losses of nutrients in cauliflower after boiling and microwaving. \nSaute, don't fry\nStudies show that during deep-fat frying, fat penetrates the food and vegetables dehydrate. But sauteing in a bit of healthy cooking oil, such as extra-virgin olive oil, is a great way to cook many vegetables. Not only does it maximize flavor, but the addition of olive oil  \"appears to increase the absorption of phytonutrients like phenols and carotenes,\" said Magee, who is also the corporate dietitian for the grocery firm Albertsons Companies. That's because many of the vitamins and nutrients in vegetables are fat soluble, meaning your body absorbs them better in the presence of fat. \nA \n2015 study\n linked sauteing certain highly popular Mediterranean vegetables, such as eggplant, in extra-virgin olive oil with an increase of antioxidants that can protect against cancer. \nOlive oil is a great option for sauteing because it has one of the highest levels of antioxidants and phytonutrients of the cooking oils. While olive oil has a lower smoke point than canola, Magee said, \"when sauteing, you control the temperature that food is cooked at, so you can avoid the higher temperatures.\"\n'Griddling,' baking and roasting\nContrary to grilling, which normally involves some sort of charcoal, \"griddling\" uses a pan with distinctive raised edges and is normally done on the stove or in the oven.\nVeggies griddled with a tiny bit of olive oil can develop intense flavor and be quite healthy. The 2009 Spanish study found it to be an especially good choice for green beans, asparagus, broccoli, celery, onions, Swiss chard and onions.  \nBaking or roasting is hit-or-miss, and very dependent on the vegetable. \n\"Oven temperature, time and the specific vegetable determines the vitamin content,\" said Magee. \"Nutrient capacity will decrease a bit with some vegetables while access to certain nutrients may go up with others.\"\nThe 2009 Spanish study found artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, celery, eggplant, green beans, onions and spinach kept their antioxidant capacity after baking. Green peppers lost antioxidant capacity. \nTomatoes are also served well by roasting -- and cooking in general. \nStudies\n show that \ncutting and heating tomatoes\n opens up the cell wall of the fruit (and tomatoes are technically a fruit), which allows greater access to the health benefits of the antioxident lycopene. Adding a bit of healthy fat, such as olive oil, helps as well.\n\"Lycopene fights a range of diseases,\" said Magee. \"The fat-soluble red pigment found primarily in tomatoes is thought to have the highest antioxidant activity of all the carotenoids and antioxidant compounds, and may reduce the risk of an assortment of diseases, from Alzheimer's to cancer.\"\nMaximize that benefit, Magee added, by never peeling a tomato or throwing away it's seeds. \"Most of the antioxidant power of the tomato actually lies in the peel and seeds,\" Magee said, \"so the best way to cook fresh tomatoes is au naturel.\" \nBut if you hate tomatoes don't rush out and buy a lycopene supplement, Magee warned. \"Overall, the evidence of lycopene's anti-cancer effect is more evident in people who eat plenty of tomato products than in those who take supplements.\"\nBest method to use?\nSo, which cooking method is best? The answer often depends on the vegetable. If you're a dedicated cook, staying on top of the latest science might be helpful.\n\"As researchers have begun to see patterns emerge that show how various food components and cooking methods actually work together to yield even greater health benefits,\" Magee said, \"the study of nutrition has been taken to a higher level. It's almost as if a new language is being spoken.\"\nBut Magee added that for days when you're too busy to look up the latest research, here's how to boil it down (so to speak): Default to steaming and microwaving with just a little bit of water, throw in a splash of olive oil when you can, and your veggies -- and body -- will thank you. ", "Harambe, Cecil: Why we mourn animal deaths so intensely": "How valuable is a life?\nYou imagine yourself driving a trolley down a fixed track. Five people are immobilized in your path. If you continue, they'll surely die. If you pull a lever, the trolley will switch to another track, but you'll kill a single person standing there. \nDo you do nothing and guarantee one tragedy, or do something -- anything -- and create another?\nZookeepers at the Cincinnati Zoo had to make such a choice when a 3-year-old boy slipped into the habitat of a silverback gorilla. After a teeth-clenching 10-minute encounter, keepers shot and killed the 450-pound gorilla, Harambe. The boy survived. \nThe decision clearly valued the life of the child. \nPublic response, for the most part, was more concerned with the animal.\nFor days, the Internet was saturated with think pieces and tributes. The boy's family was barraged with accusations and calls for criminal charges.\nWas Harambe's death the tragic result of bad parenting? Who should pay? Whose lives had Harambe touched? \nAll these questions lead to another: What causes us to mourn for, and rage on behalf of, an animal who died so a child could live? \nWe have an innate need to protect \n\"The real reason why humans get so intense about the killing of a gorilla is the same reason we get mad when children or infants die,\" says \nKurt Gray,  assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience\n at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill . \nGray says we see minds in two different ways.\n\"One way is as an agent, a thinking doer, if you will,\" he says. \"The other is as a vulnerable feeler. And those minds suffer and sense.\" \nBabies, gorillas, animals in general -- they all fall into the latter category. \n\"Animals seem so vulnerable, people feel the need to protect them,\" Gray says.  \nWe assign human intentions to animal actions\nYou would think video of the harrowing incident at the Cincinnati Zoo would provide some decisive evidence of what happened. That's proven difficult, because we have a tendency to anthropomorphize. \nWas Harambe dragging the boy through the water, or carrying him? When he pulled the boy up by the pants, was he feeling threatened? Protective? Confused?\n\"From what we saw [the child] could have been killed at any second,\" one witness told CNN affiliate WCPO. \nContrast that with what famed primatologist \nJane Goodall said\n. \"It looked as though the gorilla was putting an arm round the child.\"\nIt's easy to ascribe intent, Gray says. \n\"Our tendency is to see our actions through human lenses,\" Gray says. \"We can't imagine what it's like to actually be a gorilla. We can only imagine what it's like to be us being a gorilla.\"\nWe morph into a mob\nHarambe is the de facto emotional successor of Cecil the Lion, who was shot, skinned and decapitated outside a Zimbabwean national park last year.  \nWalter Palmer, the lion's killer, became an uncontested villain. Actually, far more than a villain -- the dentist's very humanity was questioned. Some said, outright, that \nhe too should be hunted down and flayed\n. \nThe online mob also came for Kendall Jones, \na Texas cheerleader and hunting enthusiast\n who posted pictures on Facebook of her posing next to slain leopards, hippos and mountain lions. The responses ranged  from relatively mild (\"\nMr. Zuckerberg, take down her page\n!\") to vicious (\"\nIs there any way to hunt you\n?\").\nIn Palmer\n's case, the threats extended to his wife and daughter. \"I don't understand that level of humanity to come after people not involved at all,\" Palmer told the Star Tribune\n.\nOur rush to empathize and defend lessens the more we perceive another mind to be an agent rather than an innate victim. When Harambe died, someone else had to be responsible since Harambe himself couldn't make ethical decisions. When a dentist or a cheerleader takes the life of an animal, critics see the act as reprehensible because animals are \"innocent.\"\nWe end up losing perspective\nBut from time to time, our predisposition to fight for animals slides into satire. \nTwo years ago, people were so enraged by a picture of Steven Spielberg posing in front of a dead animal he had been accused of killing, they failed to notice it was actually a triceratops prop from the original \"Jurassic Park.\" While most of the 12,000 comments on the photo are satirical, some express rage -- genuine, unchecked rage --  at the \"killing\" of an animal that hasn't roamed the planet in 66 million years.  \nWe are inured to human suffering \nCNN Legal Analyst Laura Coates says this irrational  vulnerability we seem to have for animals extends to the actual courtroom. \nAs a prosecutor, she'd had to recount for a jury the gruesome acts of a rapist or a murderer on trial.\n\"Strangely, when I would relay even the most horrific details, the reaction by juries was always tempered,\" \nshe says\n. \"But when I had an animal as victim? Please. I could have simply held up a dog biscuit during my opening statement and secured a unanimous verdict within minutes.\"\nCoates uses this striking example to make her point. The petition calling for a criminal investigation into the parents of the boy who tangled with Harambe \nhas nearly 330,000 signatures\n. A\n petition calling for justice\n for 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by police while holding a toy gun, has about half as many. \n\"Frankly, the level of concern that one would expect for an act against a human child pales in comparison to the universal cries for justice when an animal is hurt,\" \nshe wrote for CNN\n.\nIn both the deaths of Harambe and Tamir Rice, a decision was made and a lever was pulled. \nOnly one cost a human life. ", "Sick and dying at 30,000 feet": "\"Ladies and gentlemen, a passenger requires medical attention. If there is a physician or medical personnel on board, please identify yourself to a flight attendant.\"\nOne in every 604 flights involves a reported medical emergency, according to a 2013 \nstudy\n published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center calculated that translates into 44,000 in-flight medical emergencies worldwide every year.\nThe actual number may be much higher, because no mandatory reporting system exists and minor issues are very likely underreported.\nThe most common problems, according to the data collected, were fainting or feeling dizzy and lightheaded (37%), respiratory symptoms (12%) and nausea or vomiting (10%).\nBut how are these emergencies handled, especially when they're more complicated or life-threatening?\nGround support\nIn-flight medical emergencies unfold in the skies above us every day, so many large airline companies spend a lot of time and money training their flight crews on what to do when presented with these types of extraordinary situations.\n\"The flight attendants are trained as new hires very extensively, and then every year they have recurrent training that includes emergency response,\" said Barbara Martin, general manager for Air, Crew and Passenger Health Services at Delta Air Lines.\n\"They are using a medical assistance form to get the key, most important data on signs, symptoms and vital signs,\" said Martin, who is an occupational nurse by training.\n\"The pilots and dispatchers on the ground ... are also trained in what the key elements of information are that need to be transmitted to STAT-MD if there's a consult,\" Martin said. \"It's really a team effort.\"\nYou've probably never heard of STAT-MD, but the medical professionals at this low-profile University of Pittsburgh Medical Center medical communications center provide ground-based support services for a number of large commercial airlines based in North America.\n\"We basically provide in-flight consultations for in-flight emergencies, and we also provide fitness-to-fly screening for the airlines for (passengers) on the ground in case there's a question on their ability to go up into the air,\" said Dr. TJ Doyle, STAT-MD's medical director.\nDoyle said they did about 10,000 consults last year, so they're fielding about one or two calls an hour.\n\"The captain is always in charge,\" said Doyle. \"We make a recommendation based on our expertise and our experience. We've been doing this for a while and we do it quite often. So we'll make a recommendation to the captain on what we think can occur.\"\nIn the most extreme cases, that might mean recommending diverting the flight. This occurred in 7.3% of the cases reported in the 2013 study.\nFar more often, the issue is something much simpler: a diabetic whose sugar has plummeted, so he or she needs a sip of orange juice. Or perhaps someone is feeling lightheaded and may just need to be administered oxygen.\nWhen the problem is more serious\n\"If it can happen on the ground, it's going to happen in the air, as well, so we need to be able to respond to that appropriately,\" said Delta flight attendant trainer Justin Eberle. \"Passenger safety is always our number one priority.\"\nAll flight attendants working routes in the United States must be trained in CPR and how to use a defibrillator.\n\"The flight attendants have access to what we call a medical accessory kit,\" said Martin. \"That's got basic equipment in it for taking blood pressure, thermometers, personal protective equipment. If there's a medical volunteer on board, then they're given access to our emergency medical kit, and that kit has resuscitation equipment, IV equipment, medications.\"\nMany airlines require consultation with a ground-based physician, such as STAT-MD, before the emergency medical kit is used. There is only one other prominent medical communications center in the United States called MedAire, based in Phoenix, Arizona.\nKits vary widely in quality. The FAA requires contents such as saline solution, aspirin, antihistamines, epinephrine and nitroglycerine tablets. Some airlines choose to supplement the basic provisions, but supplies and medications are expensive, they take up weight and they have to be replaced when they expire.\nIt goes without saying, too, that some protocols and procedures are more challenging in the air. A simple stethoscope, for example, is rendered relatively useless in flight because of all the ambient noise.\n'Is there a doctor on the plane?'\nMore useful, often, than the equipment is the expertise of a fellow passenger. Physician passengers provided medical assistance in 48.1% of reported in-flight medical emergencies, according to the 2013 study. Nurses assisted in 20.1% of the cases.\nMartin says the number is even higher. \n\"Over the years, we've seen at least an 80% presence of a physician or RN volunteer,\" said Martin. \"In fact, the most recent year we compiled data on, 2014, we have 90% volunteer by physician or nurse during a medical event.\"\nBut what about liability?\n\"Although U.S. health care providers traveling on registered U.S. airlines have no legal obligation to assist in the event of a medical emergency, ethical obligations may prevail,\" according to a 2015 \nstudy\n, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\"In addition, many other countries, such as Australia and in Europe do impose a legal obligation to assist,\" according to researchers at the Georgetown University School of Medicine.\nTo encourage medical professionals to volunteer, Congress passed the \nAviation Medical Assistance Act\n in 1998, which protects providers who respond to in-flight medical emergencies from liability and thus encourages medical professionals to assist.\n\"This law applies to claims arising from domestic flights and most claims arising from international flights involving U.S. carriers or residents,\" the authors of the 2015 study wrote. \"The AMAA does allow for liability of providers if the patient can establish that the provider was 'grossly negligent' or intentionally caused the alleged harm ... An example of such disregard would be an intoxicated physician treating a patient.\"\nWorst-case scenario\nAmong in-flight medical emergencies, cardiac arrest is very rare, accounting for only 0.3% of such emergencies, yet it is responsible for 86% of in-flight deaths, according to the 2013 study.\nWhen possible, protocol recommends the deceased passenger should be left in place or placed out of the direct view of other passengers (possibly in the lavatory). \nFlight attendants are also advised to relocate nearby customers to alternate seats when possible. A blanket can be used to cover the customer as needed. The flight deck crew is also instructed to inform the airline's operations center to make appropriate arrangements once the aircraft is on the ground.\nAs with any in-flight emergency, the situation is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and flight attendants are advised to use their best judgment.\nAir rage is a real thing, but the biggest problem is much simpler \nPsychiatric issues constitute 3.5% of in-flight medical emergencies, according to the 2015 study.\n\"Potential stressors include a lengthy check-in process, enhanced security measures, delayed flights, cramped cabins and alcohol consumption,\" the researchers wrote. \"Acutely agitated passengers pose considerable safety concerns.\"\nThe most common problem in flight, though, is actually dehydration. And there's a reason you feel dehydrated when you travel.\n\"Passenger aircraft cabins are pressurized (to the equivalent altitude of 6,000 to 8,000 feet) by air pumped through the engines, which results in a relatively arid environment,\" according to Georgetown University researchers. \"As such, many passengers are somewhat dehydrated.\"\nThe simplest, but most significant piece of advice: Stay hydrated. That means drinking of plenty of water and avoiding alcohol when you fly.\nAnd if you take any medications, pack them in your carry-on. They won't do you any good in the cargo hold.", "After life-changing shooting, teen's spirit shines through": "\"Stop it, Abbie,\" her mother, Vickie, snaps.\n\"My head itches,\" Abbie moans, her voice reaching the familiar whine of a 14-year-old girl.\n\"I know, honey.\" Vickie's voice softens, weary with repetition. She straightens the black cap on her daughter's head, trying to cover the upper right section of Abbie's brain and skull that's completely missing.\nTwo months ago, a bullet pierced Abbie's head. The shot was \nfired at close range by a gunman\n in Kalamazoo, Michigan. \nAbbie is a slight girl weighing less than 100 pounds. The Kopfs have no clear understanding of why she survived, and even less of an understanding of how she can talk to them and remember so much so clearly.\n\"Willpower, strength?\" asks Vickie, her eyes turning upward.\nHer husband, Gene, is more blunt: \"Sheer dumb luck. The path of the bullet. It was cold that night. She was near a trauma center. A lot of dumb luck there. Fortunately, she's here.\"\n A night of terror\nAbbie had big plans for Saturday, February 20. \"Grandma Barb\" was taking her to a local theater performance.\nBarbara Hawthorne wasn't Abbie's biological grandmother, but she was so close with the Kopfs that Abbie called her Grandma Barb. The 14-year-old and 68-year-old shared qualities that made them feel related: infectious smiles, easy laughs and a gift at giving the sort of hugs that changed anyone's outlook on the day.\nGrandma Barb invited Abbie to be the only kid joining\n her group of friends \n-- Mary Lou Nye, 62, her relative Mary Jo Nye, 60, and Dorothy Brown, 74. They were going to a live performance at Miller Auditorium in Kalamazoo.\nAbbie would be out on the town, just like the adults, without her parents. Even better, Grandma Barb and her friends wanted to grab a late dinner at Cracker Barrel with their young cohort.\nJason Brian Dalton, 45, was an Uber driver. He had picked up fares throughout the night, allegedly carrying a semi-automatic handgun in his car. In between rides, prosecutors say he was on a random, murderous rampage.\nAt 5:42 p.m., the first shooting report came in to Michigan State Police. Tiana Carruthers, 25, was shot four times in an apartment complex. She would survive, and shielded her three children from the bullets.\nFour hours later, a father and son, Richard Smith, 53, and Tyler Smith, 17, were shot and killed while they looked at cars at a dealership.\nAt 10:24 p.m., Grandma Barb, Abbie and thier friends sat in two cars, a Chevrolet Cruze and an Oldsmobile minivan at the Cracker Barrel. Abbie isn't sure if she remembers the shooting or if the memories are reconstructed from news reports. She knows she still flinches when she hears loud sounds.\nThe bullet struck Abbie as she sat next to Grandma Barb, piercing her skull and frontal lobe of her brain. Barbara Hawthorne and all her friends died from their gunshot wounds.\nDalton\n has been charged with six counts of murder, and \nlast week was deemed competent to stand trial.\n He has not yet entered a plea.\n Horror, then a squeeze of the hand\nVickie and Gene Kopf rarely worried when Grandma Barb took Abbie on an outing. They were simply grateful their daughter wanted to spend so much time with senior citizens, instead of finding the trouble common among teenagers.\n\"Hello?\" Vickie said, the phone ringing. It was her aunt.\n\"Are you watching the news?\" she asked. \n\"No,\" said Vickie.\n\"You might want to. There's a crazy person shooting people in Kalamazoo. Have you heard from Abbie?\"\nVickie looked at the time. It was past the time Barbara said she'd call.\nVickie called Barb's house phone, cell phone and began texting.\nNo response.\nAs the dread began to rise, Vickie's phone rang. It was Bronson Methodist Hospital asking if she was the parent of an Abigail Kopf.\nGene Kopf drove 90 mph to the hospital in Kalamazoo, running every light he could. Vickie ran out of the car at the emergency room, racing in to find a doctor.\n\"I'm the parent,\" she wept. \nThe doctor dragged her into the elevator as Gene ran in behind her.\n\"How bad?\" Vickie managed to ask, urging the elevator to move faster.\n\"Bad, real bad,\" said the doctor.\n\"Where was she shot?\" Vickie asked.\n\"In the head,\" warned the doctor. \nVickie remembers walking into the room but she can't explain in words what she saw.\nShe closes her eyes as she shakes her head, as if pleading for the memory to leave her. \"It was horrific to see. A sight nobody would want to see.\" Vickie pauses, a tear falling down her cheek. \"No parent would want to see their kid like that.\"\nDoctors swarmed around the critically injured girl. The Kopfs remember a tornado of medical work around them and doctors giving them instructions. After seeing her daughter, Vickie doesn't remember much, except laying her head on her daughter's chest and crying. \n\"I love you,\" she cried to Abbie. \"It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.\"\nSix hours later, Vickie was still uttering those words, next to her daughter's bedside. Doctors were in the middle of neurological tests, believing the teen was brain dead.\nThe nurse encouraged Vickie to keep talking to her daughter, saying medical research has shown the patient's hearing would be the last to go.\nVickie was holding her daughter's hand, still talking. \"If you can hear me, Abbie, if you're in there, give me a sign,\" she kept whispering.\nA flinch. \nVickie jumped back, startled. Did she imagine it? The nurse said bodies after trauma often flinch.\n\"Abbie, can you hear me? Do that again!\" Vickie pleaded. \nAbbie's fingers, thin and pale, moved, then intertwined with her mother's fingers. More forcefully, Abbie began smacking her mother's hand. Vickie thought Abbie was using her thumb to try to draw the letter \"B\" for Grandma Barb.\nAbbie was awake.\nA long road to recovery\nEarlier this month, Abbie gripped the bars as she stepped forward at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids. She did little to hide the frustration as she put one foot forward again and again for eight hours of rehab a day. Abbie was impatient. She wanted to get back to her favorite sport, gymnastics, and flip off the uneven bars. \nThat she was walking at all astonished her doctors. \n\"She has made remarkable progress,\" said Dr. A.J. Rush, a pediatric psychiatrist who led her care at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital. \"I expect Abbie will continue to improve with intensive outpatient therapy,\" added Rush, who will continue to oversee her care.\nAbbie returned home from the rehab facility for the first time last week. Her prognosis isn't clear. At age 14, Abbie's skull isn't as strong as an adult's skull so she's more vulnerable to injury. The bullet struck her in the frontal lobe, a part of the brain that controls eye and body movement, motor function, language, emotions, personality and judgment. Abbie's injury will likely result in delays and deficits that may not be clear until later in her life. The frontal lobe finishes development at around age 16.\nAbbie will have surgery on May 13. Her parents say a 3-D printer will form a new skull for Abbie, although bone and bullet fragments will remain in her brain.\nAbbie still smiles easily and brightly for strangers, but the smiles mask a number of constant, painful remnants. Abbie's Batman pillow has a speaker tucked behind it, so music soothes a splitting, ever-persistent migraine. The migraines are so powerful she vomits from the pain.\nDoctor's appointments and physical therapy are scheduled daily, her family racing from one to the next. Abbie suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, a horror that remains in check from medication she dutifully takes from her parents, now both her full-time nurses. \nGene, who worked in IT and was working on his master's degree, quit his job to care for his daughter, who now needs 24-hour care. Their girl who used to run upstairs to her bedroom now sleeps on a couch in the living room, unable to walk up the stairs without significant struggle. Her parents sleep on the couch with her, ready to jump up to help her to the bathroom or fetch water.\nDoctors tell the Kopfs to start saving now for medical expenses down the road. They wonder how, given that there's no income coming in. Even though insurance has covered the bulk of the expenses, much remains unpaid. Fear of financial ruin is exceeded only by the concern over their daughter's health and future.\nThe Kopfs say donations have kept them afloat, mainly from a\n GoFundMe account \nset up for their daughter's medical bills. They try to communicate with donors through a Facebook page and Twitter account, posting her remarkable progress.\nGene said he's not angry, but he often feels overcome by helplessness. Kopf channeled that sentiment by asking a question to candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders at a CNN Democratic debate last month. He asked about the mass shootings, including the one that injured his daughter, and what the candidates planned to do to address such violence. \n\"I don't want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or criminal backgrounds, because that doesn't work,\" he said to applause.\nKopf didn't care about their answers. He was asking the question to parents watching the debate. \"What I'm hoping to gain is, I'm rubbing everyone's nose into the problem because it seems that we as a country keep sweeping it under. Something's gotta be done about it. Either we're insane as a society or there's something in our gun policies. I'm not saying I got a magical fix. I'm just saying in order to fix the problem, you first have to address it.\"\n\"I want to be a marine biologist,\" Abbie says. She's propped up on her couch with three stuffed animals: Sharkie, Sharkie #2 and Cutie Pie. Her parents don't dissuade her from dreaming about diving in the sea examining ocean life. \n\"If anyone can do it, this little girl can,\" says Vickie.\n\"I'm not little, I'm 14,\" protests Abbie. \nHer mother laughs. \"You're so right, Abbie.\" ", "Is it time for football to reconsider marijuana?": "If you play professional football, \"your job automatically gives you the symptom of chronic pain,\" said Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle \nEugene Monroe\n, who has played in the NFL since 2009. \"You're hitting each other as hard as possible every single day in practice. Your body is in pain a lot of time.\" \nMore and more players are looking to marijuana for pain relief, he said, despite risking punishment from the NFL. \nThere are existing ways to manage pain: opioids and noninflammatory medications. But Monroe and other players are concerned about addiction and the \npotential for overdoses\n. \n\"All over our country people are addicted, and that's happening in our locker rooms,\" Monroe said.\nLast year, \na class action lawsuit was filed against the 32 NFL teams\n by former players who alleged that team coaches, staff members and doctors pushed painkillers onto players to get them back on the field. The case has been transferred to the federal court in the northern district of California. A similar suit was filed in 2014, but was dismissed.\nDuring Super Bowl week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said of the current marijuana policy, \"It's an NFL policy and we believe it's the correct policy, for now, in the best interest of our players and the long-term health of our players.\"\nGoodell acknowledged that there have been some scientific developments about the uses of marijuana, but not enough. \n\"I agree there has been changes, but not significant enough changes that our medical personnel have changed their view,\" he said. \"Until they do, then I don't expect that we will change our view.\"  \nThe NFL Players Association said,  \"Marijuana is currently a banned substance under the collectively bargained Substances of Abuse Policy. Both parties to the Policy (NFL and NFLPA) seek guidance from the independent medical professionals who administer the policy, and no change to marijuana's status as a banned substance has been recommended by those medical professionals.\"\nBut Monroe said it is time for more research to look at the possible benefits of medical marijuana, especially as he sees players turning to it. He's the first current NFL player to publicly take this stance. \n\"The NFL will need to have legitimate information before they remove marijuana from the banned substance list and ultimately not hurt their product in the field,\" Monroe said. \"But there's opportunity in that space also, for the NFL to get involved and maybe lead efforts.\"\nMarijuana use in the NFL\nSome retired players admitted to using marijuana while in the NFL, and active players, such as Monroe, have said it's common. All the numbers regarding marijuana use in the NFL -- whether for pain relief, concussion prevention or recreation -- are anecdotal. Admitting to marijuana use could be career ending. \nNate Jackson\n, who retired after six seasons with the Denver Broncos, said he started using pot recreationally in high school, but began using it to manage pain on the field. Last year, he called on the NFL to reconsider its marijuana ban.\n\"Cannabis has been part of my football experience since I started,\" said Jackson, who played from 2003 to 2008. \"I never liked the pills and medicated with cannabis.\" \nHeather Jackson, one founder of the nonprofit \nRealm of Caring Foundation\n, said she knows of 19 current and former players who are using oil derived from the cannabis plant to lessen the impact of potential brain injuries when they are out on the field, and as a therapy after being hit with a concussion. \nTo get a better grasp of just how many players are using marijuana and why, \nRealm of Caring \nis raising money to help launch a study with Johns Hopkins University. Realm of Caring provides education and support about cannabis to adults and children suffering from a host of diseases, including epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's.\n \n\"We want to go in and learn as much about the players. Who's using? What kind of benefit? How does it benefit (players) versus traditional treatments? Are there other associated effects?\" said\n Ryan Vandrey\n, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nVandrey has been involved in cannabis research for 16 years. He also plans to do biological testing for \"inflammatory biomarkers that have been associated with head trauma and pain.\" \nWith a large assessment of the players, Vandrey hopes that better studies can help researchers understand marijuana's impact on players. \nResearch on marijuana\nThe marijuana plant is composed of some 500 chemicals that work together to create its impact on the brain. It's known as \"\nthe entourage effect\n\" -- the chemicals work best together, instead of in isolation. Two particular chemicals of interest are THC and cannabadiol, known as CBD. \nWhen it comes to pain relief, marijuana has a \nscientific track record\n. THC is the chemical ingredient that makes people feel high. However, it can also provide relief from pain. For patients undergoing chemotherapy, it can help them regain their appetite. It has been found to reduce pain for patients with \narthritis\n, and has\n anti-inflammatory qualities.\n Marijuana was widely used for pain relief in the 1800s. \nThere's not much research about marijuana's impact on brain injuries. Animal studies have found that CBD has a neuroprotective effect\n \non brain cells. When CBD was administered to \npigs\n with brain injuries, CBD brought electircal activity close to normal levels and reduced amounts of stress on the brain.\n \nMice who were administered CBD had \nfewer brain cells die\n from brain injury, when compared to mice that didn't have CBD. \nResearch on marijuana is difficult because the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration continues to categorize it as a \ndrug with no currently accepted medical use\n.\nBut the U.S. government holds a \npatent \non marijuana as a neuroprotectant. In the patent, it says \"The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia.\" \nArt Caplan,\n dean of  research for New York University's Sports and Society program, said it's too early to start using pot to help relieve concussions. \n\"I think the science on concussion is nonexistent. I hear it said. I think it's just talk,\" Caplan said. \nDr. Julie Holland\n, a psychiatrist and author of \"\nThe Pot Book: A Complete Guide to Cannabis,\"\n agrees that the studies on marijuana and concussions are early.\n \nBut, she said, that's why more research needs to be done.\n\"There isn't data yet, but there should be, and the government shouldn't be holding back on doing research,\" she said.\nPolicy changes ahead?\nAs more states legalize marijuana use, Caplan said, the NFL will have to catch up.\n\"(The NFL has) to bring their policies in line,\" Caplan said. \"It's absurd to work in the Nancy Reagan 'just say no' frame when we have acceptance of use sweeping through the U.S. at a rapid rate.\" \nFor players on the field, Eugene Monroe said, marijuana isn't just a tool to be pain free, but to live life beyond the football field.\n\"When the season is over,\" Monroe said, \"players can play with their kids, see their families and not have their bodies ache.\" ", "These are the 100 deadliest days for teens": "From 2010 to 2014, more than 5,000 people have died in crashes involving teen drivers in those 100 days, AAA said today. \nA new study\n (PDF) by the association's Foundation for Traffic Safety showed that nearly 60% of teen crashes involved distracted drivers.\nThe AAA says that over the past five years, the average number of crashes involving drivers ages 16-19 increased 16% per day during the \"100 deadliest days,\" compared with other days of the year.\nSome of the reasons for the spike make sense. Teens are driving more during the summer, and it might be more recreational than purposeful, the \nNational Safety Council\n reports. For instance, instead of driving back and forth to school, they might be driving to the beach, lake or river, and heading down roads they haven't driven before.\nBut one of the biggest reasons for the summer risk increase is that teens might be driving more frequently with more of their friends.\n\"We have always known that passengers were a big risk for teens, but what we're really finding out now is, passengers may be one of the most important risks for teens, even more so than things like texting,\" said John Ulczycki, the National Safety Council's vice president of strategic initiatives.\nSteering teen drivers out of harm's way \nThink about it this way, Ulczycki said: Passengers are a distraction the entire time a teen is driving, whereas the distraction from texting is probably limited to the seconds or minutes they're looking at screens instead of the road.\nPassengers increase the risk of a teen driver having a fatal crash by at least 44%, according to the National Safety Council.\n\"It's tragic that parents don't really appreciate the risks of passengers,\" Ulczycki said, adding that parents may understand the risks of texting or cell phone use but aren't as aware of the dangers of a new driver hitting the road with friends in the car.\nA majority of states have laws on the books regarding the number of passengers allowed for new drivers. Some states don't allow any for the first six months or year after getting a license; some allow one passenger. \n''If you have a kid who had their license for less than one year, you have to think very, very carefully about the conditions or the situations in which you allow them to carry any passengers. You really do,\" Ulczycki said.\nCNN iReport: Parents of teens share driving tips \nUlczycki, a father of six in Wilmette, Illinois, didn't allow his children to drive with passengers for the first year of their official driving lives. \"It was a real bone of contention,\" he said. \"They weren't happy about it, but they all survived.\"\nA 2014 study found that loud conversations and horseplay between passengers were more likely than technology to result in a dangerous incident involving teen drivers.\nThe\n study by the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center\n tracked 52 high-school age drivers in North Carolina who agreed to have cameras installed in their cars. The study appeared in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\nWhen there was loud conversation in the car, teen drivers were six times more likely to need to take actions like making an evasive maneuver to avoid a crash. When there was horseplay in the vehicle, they were three times more likely to get into a similarly serious episode, according to the study.\n\"Forty-three states currently restrict newly licensed drivers from having more than one young passenger in their vehicle,\" Robert Foss, senior research scientist at the \nHighway Safety Research Center, \nand director of the \nCenter for the Study of Young Drivers\n, said in a news release. \"The results of this study illustrate the importance of such restrictions, which increase the safety of drivers, their passengers and others on the road by reducing the potential chaos that novice drivers experience.\"\nWhat sways teens not to drink, drive? Stories, not stats\n \nIn 2014, we traveled to Roxbury, New Jersey, to talk with \nBarb Dunn, her husband and her 16-year-old son, Daniel\n, about how they were trying to teach Daniel about safety as he learns to drive. \nWhen I got back in touch with Dunn about the dangers of the summer months, her anxiety went up.\n\"My first reaction is fear. Then sadness,\" Dunn said via e-mail. \"I just heard a similar statistic about prom night being a very dangerous time. ... I think we have to take the time to to talk to our children and remind them of the risks and talk about how to minimize them.\"\nUlczycki of the National Safety Council said the best advice for parents is to understand the risks about passengers and drive with them so they can get accustomed to having people in the car. He also suggests that parents consider the risks of driving at night.\n\"It's not the time of night. It's how dark it is. That's really the risk here, and I think too many parents think of night driving as a social curfew. 'Well, I'll let my kid stay out until 11 p.m., so he's fine,' \" Ulczycki said. \"It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with the risk of driving after dark.\"\nZero tolerance makes zero sense: Teen punished for helping drunk friend\nAnnette DiCola Lanteri, a mom of two in Bayport, Long Island, has two girls who are still a few years away from driving age.\nThe best thing parents can do, she said on Facebook, is to teach teen drivers the best we can.\n\"Give them the most knowledge we can so that they can adequately protect themselves, then pray,\" DiCola Lanteri said. \"There are so many variables and we only have so much control.\"\nWhat do you think is the best way to keep teen drivers safe this summer?

As of May 19, 10 countries had reported sexual transmission: the United States, France, Italy, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Portugal, New Zealand, Canada and Germany. Of those, the majority were via vaginal intercourse, with one confirmed case in Dallas of anal transmission and one suspected case of transmission via oral sex with ejaculation.\nAll published cases of sexual transmission have been from men who had signs of the virus. \"It remains unknown,\" the WHO said, \"if women or asymptomatic men can transmit the virus through sexual activity.\"", "100-pound weight loss helps 'broken' man rebuild": "Even as a child, nothing could overwhelm his obsession with food. His mother, who had lost her father as a teenager because he didn't take care of himself, tried to help Harmon eat less and be active. But neither her worrying nor his family history really reached Harmon. \nAnd even though he was teased in school for being overweight, Harmon developed and hid behind a defense mechanism: being the \"funny fat guy.\"\n\"When people laugh, it's fulfilling,\" Harmon said. \"Filling that role enabled me to be a social chameleon and slide between friend groups.\" \nIn a recent post on his \nBackyard Banter blog\n, where Harmon revealed his story, he recalled making a comment as a child that became his view on food and life: \"We don't really care about the quality of food anymore, just as long as there is a lot of it, and it gets to us quickly.\"  \nHarmon remembered saying that with a childhood friend, who was also overweight. \"I was just obsessed with food and consumed by it, and it didn't have limits,\" he said. \nIn middle school, Harmon would make a breaded chicken sandwich on white bread as an after-school snack each day. Getting his driver's license opened him to a world of fast food possibilities. By the time he graduated from high school, the 6-foot-3 Harmon weighed 285 pounds.\nHis college meal plan and student discounts at nearby restaurants provided convenient food around the clock. College is also where he started binge drinking every night. Even though Harmon's roommate would indulge with him, he was also an athlete who went to the gym every day. He often tried to coax Harmon into going with him, only to get a solid \"no\" each time. Harmon felt that he would be met with nothing but shame if he went to the gym. \n\"I thought people would laugh at me and look at me like I didn't belong there,\" he said. \nBut his insecurities, which had been mounting since middle school, grew stronger as he looked around at his friends, who were healthy and in good shape. \nHe attempted working out some at the gym but never committed for long. \nBy junior year, Harmon felt completely out of control and reached his peak weight of 315 pounds. Seeing the number \"3\" at the beginning gave the avid football fan a new perspective. \n\"I thought, 'this is what offensive linemen weigh, but I'm not an offensive lineman or an athlete,' \" Harmon said. \"The thing is, I never felt like I was 300 pounds, and no one ever looked at me and thought I was over 300 pounds, either.\"\nHe was spurred to start making small changes to his diet. He hired a personal trainer during the summer before his senior year and went to the gym twice a week. He dropped back to 285 pounds, but he was still eating unhealthily on the whole and stayed at that weight until graduating with a sociology degree in May 2013. \nWhen Harmon temporarily moved back home that month, his parents revealed that they were getting a divorce. His father moved out the next day. \nHarmon took a job in Lynchburg, Virginia, where he'd gone to college, and soon realized that it wasn't right for him. \nIn August, he was faced with the impact of the divorce combined with a breakup, the loss of a childhood friend to suicide, the loss of his second grandmother in the span of a year and the realization that his job had turned into a disaster. He entered a deep, dark depression. He would drink to excess at every opportunity and gained back some of the weight he had lost. He was consumed by pain and dreaded waking up each morning. \n\"It also brought all of these things I had buried -- the pain and insecurities of being overweight -- over the course of my life to the surface,\" Harmon said. \"It scooped that stuff out and removed all of the boundaries.\"\nHarmon finally wanted to make a change. He knew that he had to stop and help himself. And the career path he had envisioned when he was in college no longer seemed right. Fueling his passion for writing about football, Harmon started the Backyard Banter blog in December 2013. \n\"Writing about football saved my life,\" Harmon said. \"I needed an outlet besides this job I had. When I started the blog, it was for fun. But it gave me confidence that I had never had before. People liked my writing and started responding on Twitter, telling me how good I was at it. And I thought, 'your life is worth living.' I decided to go for it and pursue football writing as my career.\"\nThat same month, he also committed to a total lifestyle change. Harmon put himself in therapy and saw a counselor. He realized that if his life was worth living, he needed to start with his health. \n\"If I want to feel better, I have to look in the mirror and be satisfied,\" Harmon thought. \nHarmon started going to the gym six days a week, alternating cardio and weightlifting. He cut out carbohydrates and sugar, mainly eating eggs, lean meats and green vegetables. In eight weeks, his weight dropped into the 260s, and he watched his transformation in the mirror as muscles replaced fat. \nEncouraged by the impact of the changes he had made, Harmon moved away from his strict diet and discovered a healthy balance that he could maintain. All the while, he was still losing weight, working toward his dream of being a football writer and even adopting a dog, Charlie, to keep him active with daily walks. \nWhen NFL Media offered him a job and he moved to Los Angeles from Northern Virginia, Harmon weighed 231 pounds. But his first season as a football writer, and living in L.A.,  provided new temptations of free food and cut back on the amount of time he could spend at the gym. He gained back 10 pounds by the end of the season but didn't let the setback deter him from his lifestyle change. \nIn the offseason, he has maintained a six-day workout plan that incorporates running, weight training and yoga. Harmon is also back to a more strict diet including egg whites, kale, lean meats, fish, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and brown rice. He  weighs 218 pounds, but that's not the end of the road for his journey to wellness. \n\"My goal is to never be satisfied,\" Harmon said. \"Not with my health or career or anything else. I look and feel good, and I'm at an acceptable stopping point, but I always want to feel that there's always more I can do.\" \nHarmon has a plan for his second season as a football writer and how to avoid inevitable temptations by thinking about how far he's come and the bigger picture. And by sharing his story, which quickly spread on social media, Harmon now feels accountable to his friends and family as well as his followers on Twitter and those who shared their own stories. \nThe positive reactions to his story also encourage Harmon to keep striving for more and he hopes to inspire people by sharing more in the future. \n\"I want to be an example and show that you can beat something like this and come out on the other end,\" Harmon said. \"Change is possible. The things that I went through happened for a reason. I feel like I'm the luckiest idiot in the world. If the person I was could do it, you can, too.\"", "Could this test help prevent high school football deaths?": "Williams' death is one of 11 high school football-related deaths so far this season. Burke County Coroner Susan Salemi \ntold CNN that his death was heart-related\n. \nAn \nanalysis\n from the \nNational Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research\n database says that among high school and college players, about 12 football-related fatalities occur every year.\nThe leading cause of death isn't football-related trauma, but sudden cardiac arrest.\nFrom  2003 to 2013, there were 514 deaths among NCAA athletes, and 79 cardiac arrests among them, said \nDr. Kim Harmon\n, a sports medicine doctor with the University of Washington who has tracked sudden deaths in college athletes for the National Collegiate Athletic Association. That's about eight deaths from cardiac arrest every year.\nIn that same 10-year period, there were four deaths from head injuries, Harmon said\nMales and African-American athletes are more susceptible to cardiac arrest than others, and it's more likely to hit football and basketball players, she said. \nAccording to the\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n, about 2,000 people younger than 25 will die from sudden cardiac arrest every year. In 2013, the National Institutes of Health and the CDC announced a registry to track sudden cardiac deaths in people younger than 24, but the data is still limited.\n\"Right now, there isn't a way to know the magnitude of the problem ... we don't have very good numbers,\" Harmon said. \nA test to find at-risk athletes \nHarmon believes that a simple electrocardiogram screening, which measures the heart's electrical activity, could help prevent these deaths. It can seem like a clear solution to a tragic problem.\n\"When we see young people die suddenly, it leaves all of us with a sick feeling and of course everybody would like to identify some strategy (to keep) the death's from happening, \" said \nDr. Linda Gillam\n, chair of cardiology for the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center, and the New York Jets' cardiologist. \"The EKG part -- it has appeal because it's a test and a computer.\" \n'Great kid, athlete' dies after high school football game\nIn fact, all athletes in Italy are all screened with EKGs. This year, the NCAA considered mandatory  EKG screenings for athletes, and legislators from several states, including Texas and South Carolina, pushed for legislation requiring wide-scale screening of high school athletes. So far, all of these attempts in the United States have failed. \nBut both the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology oppose wide-scale EKG screenings as a way to find athletes at risk for sudden cardiac death. \n\"The EKG as a test has enormous false positives and false negatives and was never intended to raise suspicions of these complex conditions in the general population,\" said \nDr. Barry Maron\n, lead author of the American Heart Association's position statement on the use of EKG screenings among young athletes. \nOne study found\n that as many as one-third of all athlete EKGs yielded false positives results. Nine out of 10 times, EKGs \nhave been found to miss\n heart problems such as coronary anomalies, which are the second most-common cause of sudden cardiac death. \nIn addition, tracking young athletes' hearts can be particularly difficult, said \nDr. Damion Martins\n, director of internal medicine for the New York Jets. \n\"Even at the young age, the heart is a muscle ... there are 16-year-olds that can have an enlarged heart from muscle, so it looks like an athlete EKG. It has higher voltage. Pediatricians say this is abnormal, but a sports medicine specialist would say that's the typical pattern of a trained athlete,\" Martins said. \"Untrained physicians overcall abnormality, and that leads to further testing.\"\nAlternatives to EKGs\nMartins and Harmon argue that there's not an issue with the test, but with training doctors.\n\"You need the proper resources to read EKGs properly,\" Harmon said. With training, \"EKG can probably pick up two-thirds of disease that can potentially predispose to sudden cardiac arrest.\"\nLouisiana high school football player dies after injury\nBut there still isn't an accepted standard for understanding athletes' heart patterns. \nQuality control of screenings on a wide scale simply doesn't work well, Marron said. Aside from trying to ensure that trained specialists are reading the EKGs correctly, they can become expensive. \"Community screening is very hard to do. Financially hard to support, frequently based on volunteers,\" he said.\nPoorly interpreted results can mean unnecessary testing, which costs money, said\n Dr. Benjamin Levine\n, professor of exercise science at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who argued against the legislation in Texas.\n\"It falls upon the poorest,\" he said. \"So what do you do with a kid out in West Texas who doesn't have insurance, there isn't a pediatric cardiologist  for 500 miles? What's that kid supposed to do? You can't just wave your hands over it.\"\nInstead of community EKG screenings, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology advise using a \n14-point questionnaire\n that asks students about possible symptoms and family health histories.\nKeeping young players safe on the football field\nLisa Salberg, founder of the \nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association\n,  helped push a law in New Jersey that mandates the screening as part of every student athlete's physical.\n\"The physician can make the decision about who needs a referral and needs to get additional testing,\" she said. Later this year, the questionnaire will also be part of every New Jersey child's well visit. After all, there isn't any data that shows sudden cardiac arrest to be less prevalent among non-athletes. \n\"If Mom and Dad are filling out the forms, when they have the conversation with the provider, then we're doing cascade screening for the family, doing more comprehensive screening,\" Salberg said. \"We need to think of health care as a continuum -- it's about the family.\"\nWhat can parents do?\nFor parents who already worry about their kids playing football, sudden death from cardiac arrest might make it feel like the game is too dangerous. \n\"The risk of being struck by lightning is about the same,\" said Levine, the UT Southwestern Medical Center professor.\nIn addition, symptoms such as  fatigue and dizziness, which can be attributed to heart issues, can also be reflective of other problems in young athletes. \"Kids get sick, so these symptoms are not particularly specific,\" said Martins, the Jets' doctor. \nIt's important to focus on the relationships between athletes, parents, doctors and athletic trainers, Martins said.\n\"The athletic trainer becomes the reference, the point person between the athlete and the parent,\" he said. \"They're there day-to-day. When the athlete complains of symptoms, the athletic trainer needs to identify those and see a physician.\"", "Gun violence not a mental health issue, experts say": "That is not the same as saying gun violence is a mental health issue, which has become a renewed area of contention since President Obama announced \nnew actions\n earlier this month to reduce gun violence, including increased funding for mental health treatment and enhanced background checks. \nMental health advocates say media reports of mass shootings by disturbed individuals galvanize public attention and reinforce the impression that severe mental illness leads to violence. But various epidemiologic studies over the past two decades show that the vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are never violent toward others. \nPeople with serious mental illness are three times more likely than those who are not mentally ill to commit violent acts again themselves or others, but that is still a very small number of people, about 2.9% of people with serious mental illness within a year. And the impact on gun violence statistics is marginal, amounting to about 4% of all firearm homicides, according to \nresearch as recent as last year\n.\nWhen talking about gun deaths from suicide, however, epidemiologists say mental illness legitimately becomes an area of concern. Suicides accounted for 61% of all firearm fatalities in the United States in 2014, or 21,384 of 33,599 gun deaths recorded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFinding new indicators of risk\nGun violence and mental illness are public health problems \"that intersect at the edges\" but have very little overlap, said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who specializes in gun violence and mental illness. \nIt's a phrase that frequently appears in his research and journal articles to emphasize the point that fixing the mental health system is not a silver bullet for reducing gun violence, he said. It takes multiple approaches, many of which have nothing to do with the mentally ill.\n\"Mental health stakeholders are loath to have this conversation about improving mental health care in a context driven by violence prevention, because that's not why we need mental health reform per se,\" Swanson said. \"We need it because people are struggling with illnesses and they don't have access to care.\"\nInstead of policies that restrict gun access based solely on mental illness diagnoses, or because a person has made contact with the judicial system or health care agencies due to mental illness, the \nAmerican Psychological Association\n, the \nNational Alliance on Mental Illness\n and other advocacy groups have called for criteria based on more subtle indicators of potentially dangerous behavior, largely informed by the work of Swanson and others.\nThe difficulty is that policies intended to keep guns away from mentally ill people who are likely to be violent depend on clinicians' ability to accurately identify them. \nResearch shows\n that risk prediction, especially for statistically rare events like mass shootings, is an inexact science, \"only slightly more accurate than flipping a coin.\" \nHow, then, can policymakers strike a balance, and will Obama's executive orders address these concerns? \nIdentifying \"evidence of dangerousness\"\nObama put mental health stakeholders in a tough spot when \nhe announced on January 5\n new actions to reduce gun violence. He acknowledged the underfunded needs of a struggling population and proposed a $500 million investment toward improving access to care and treatment services.\nBut some balked at the inclusion of mental health reform in a bundle of orders aimed at reducing gun violence.\n\"The mental health community and stakeholders are very concerned about reinforcing the false association in the public's mind between mental illness and violence, because that is a source of a great deal of discrimination,\" Swanson said.\nAs Swanson and his colleagues see it, gun ownership restrictions related to mental health are too broad and too narrow all at once. They capture a lot of people because of some contact with the courts or health care system, in some cases minor or a long time ago, who are actually at low risk of perpetrating gun violence. At the same time, they miss people who have yet to be diagnosed, adjudicated mentally ill or involuntarily committed, including people who are suicidal or have pathological anger, he said. \nSwanson supports intervention at the point of purchase through comprehensive background checks. But to make background checks work, criteria for inclusion on the database should be based on other indicators of risk besides mental health history, such as pending charges or convictions for violent assault, domestic violence restraining orders or multiple DUIs. These are indicators of aggressive, impulsive or risky behavior, Swanson said.\n\"Criteria for becoming a prohibited person needs to map onto risk,\" he said. \"We need to mix criteria to make it more about contemporaneous indicators of risk.\"\nThe American Psychiatric Association also recommends firearms restriction based on \"evidence of dangerousness.\"\nThe APA has called for the development and testing of better methods to identify high-risk individuals who should be denied gun access, implying that current criteria under federal law related to mental illness are inadequate to serve as a basis for gun disqualification. On the other hand, the APA points out in its position statement that while research shows most people diagnosed with serious mental health conditions are never violent toward others, and most violent individuals do not suffer from these major mental disorders, merely having a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder should not be the only basis for disqualification from firearms. \nA number of common mental health conditions -- including personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol use disorder -- tend to be associated with the risky mix of pathological anger with gun access, according to the APA. \n\"However, only a small proportion of angry people with guns has ever been hospitalized for a mental health problem -- voluntarily or involuntarily -- and thus most would not be prohibited from firearms under the involuntary commitment exclusion.\" \nWho are the 'pathologically angry'?\nTo find out the proportion of angry people in the United States who own or carry guns and have a diagnosable mental illness, Swanson and colleagues conducted household surveys with 9,282 people from February 2001 to April 2003, excluding people who carried guns for work, resulting in a response rate of 70.9%.\nAn \nanalysis of survey results\n estimated that nearly 1 in 10 adults has access to firearms and also has a problem with anger and impulsive aggressive behavior. \nThese people were more likely to be male, younger, married, and to live in outlying areas around metropolitan centers rather than in central cities, Swanson and his colleagues wrote in their report. \nThey were significantly more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a wide range of mental disorders, including depression, bipolar and anxiety disorders, PTSD, intermittent explosive disorder, pathological gambling, eating disorder, alcohol and illicit drug use disorders, and a range of personality disorders. \nWhat's more, despite evidence of \"considerable psychopathology\" in many of these respondents, only a very small proportion, 8% to 10%, were ever hospitalized for a mental health problem. \n\"Because a minority of psychiatric hospitalizations are involuntary, only a small fraction of these respondents could have had a potentially gun-disqualifying involuntary commitment,\" Swanson and his colleagues said in their report. \nSuicide prevention could have the biggest impact\nWhile mass shootings often grab the headlines, the reality is that guns are also used by thousands of individuals to end their own lives, often with little or no media attention.\nSome observers say that talking more about suicides will change the focus of the gun control debate, in part by bringing a new demographic of victims into the discussion. Where often the victims of firearm-related homicide are young black or Hispanic males, nearly 80% of those who use guns to take their own lives are white men, according to the CDC. \nAcross the population, \nmany\n \nstudies\n have shown that suicide risk is substantially higher in persons with mental disorders. And a \ngrowing body of research\n suggests that having guns in the home contributes to increased suicide risk above and beyond other risk factors such as substance abuse, a history of self-harm, hopelessness or depression.\nWhile access to mental health treatment can help alleviate risk factors for suicide, so can keeping guns out of homes of people at risk of using them to harm themselves, epidemiologists say.\nLimited research has been conducted in the United States evaluating state gun restrictions on rates of violence and suicide. Swanson and his colleagues noted this in the 2015 Annals of Epidemiology article, \"\nMental illness and reduction of gun violence and suicide: Bringing epidemiologic research to policy\n.\" But a growing body of research points to similar conclusions regarding the effectiveness of background checks and firearms restrictions. \nA \n2011 study\n of the impact of state firearm regulations from 1995 to 2004 found that gun permit and licensing requirements significantly lowered suicide rates among males. The findings support \nearlier studies\n of the effects of the \nBrady Law\n, which found that gun background checks and waiting periods significantly reduced suicide in the older population. Another \nfrequently cited study\n from 1991 looked at the effects of restrictive handgun licensing in the District of Columbia from 1968 to 1987. The study found that a handgun ban signed into law in 1976 was followed by an abrupt decline in gun suicides. No similar reductions were seen in suicides by other means, and no reductions were seen in neighboring jurisdictions that were not subject to the law. There were also no increases in suicides by other means, suggesting that people did not substitute other methods for firearms.\nTesting solutions on the state level\nState laws restricting access to guns by \nrequiring permits to purchase firearms\n also show promise for reducing suicide rates. Researchers examined suicide rates in Connecticut and Missouri, two states that recently changed their permit-to-purchase handgun laws in recent decades. \nConnecticut passed a law in 1995 that requires people to apply for a permit with local law enforcement and take eight hours of gun safety training before they can buy a firearm. In the 10 years after its passage, the rate of gun-related suicide in Connecticut was 15% lower than what researchers predict it would have been had the law not been passed.\nIn contrast, Missouri repealed a law in 2007 that required people to apply with the local police for permission to buy a gun. The gun-related suicide rate in Missouri was 16% higher from 2007 to 2011 than researchers predict it would have been, based on the rates in the comparable states of North Carolina and Nebraska. \nNone of those interventions can do anything about guns already in the home. Researchers are keeping a close eye on the effect of laws in Connecticut, Indiana and California allowing the temporary seizure of guns from people who pose an immediate threat of harm, known as gun violence restraining orders or pre-emptive gun seizure laws. While such policies could help address suicides, researchers hope they will flag so-called \"lone wolf terrorists\" or \"pseudo-commando killers\" behind mass shootings who may not be prohibited from owning a gun under current laws.\nAs Swanson and colleague Dr. Alan Felthous note in a \n2015 article for Behavioral Sciences & the Law\n, \"Although no one would argue that they were not deeply psychologically disturbed, the fact is that killers including \nJared Loughner\n, \nJames Holmes\n, \nAaron Alexis\n and \nElliot Rodger\n had never been involuntarily committed and could thus legally purchase firearms.\" \nObama's proposed $500 million investment toward improving access to mental health treatment could very well catch the Loughners and the Rodgers out there. Balancing the desire to snag them upstream with the rights enshrined in the Second Amendment will continue to be a challenge for policymakers. \n\"Recent tragedies have focused attention on the fact that most people with serious mental illness do not have access to mental health treatment,\" NAMI executive director Michael Fitzpatrick said \nin an open letter in 2013\n. \n\"Misguided policies that have the effect of further limiting access to care would be ill-advised and counterproductive to the goal of improving mental health treatment.\"\nFollow CNN Health on \nFacebook\n and \nTwitter\n.", "What's causing mysterious kidney disease?": "These are some of the end-stage symptoms of chronic kidney disease, known as CKD, a painful disease typically resulting from severe hypertension or diabetes, the\n most common causes \nof the condition worldwide. \nBut in these farmers, such lifestyle diseases are not the issue, and more than 20 years into their epidemic, public health officials remain baffled as to the cause. It remains a mystery.\n\"Globally, no one knows,\" said Neil Pearce, \nprofessor of epidemiology and biostatistics \nat the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nThe numbers are highest in four equatorial regions around the world -- Central America, Sri Lanka, India and Egypt -- and only recently have the regional epidemics been recognized for their similarities in this unique form of the condition, called chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology, or CKDu. \nRates of the disease in Central America are fairly widely acknowledged, with \n46% of male deaths\n in the region of Chichigalpa, Nicaragua, over the past decade thought to be caused by CKDu, according to \nLa Isla Foundation\n.\n\"(But) even there, we don't know how extensive it is,\" Pearce said. \nThe concern in Sri Lanka is equally high, with 2.9 million people \nestimated to be at high risk \n(PDF) of developing the deadly disease, congregated mostly in the country's North Central Province -- but the scale of this epidemic has remained more hidden internationally.\n \"What we do know is it looks like the same thing is happening ... but it's also not known if it's the same disease,\" Pearce said.\nThe Sri Lankan government has had enough of the mystery, convening experts from around the world last week to find answers, in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Approximately 45 global experts from a range of organizations, academic institutions and disciplines took part in the consultation.\n\"The problem is being taken very seriously here,\" said Pearce, who attended the meeting to push the need for a standardized research protocol to be used in each of the hot spots. \"Until we've (done) that, it's hard to say how big the problem is.\"\nPearce's team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is conducting a survey in Nicaragua, looking for clues or insight into any patterns there.\nWhat are the clues?\nCKDu has mainly affected coastal farmers, mostly men, working in extremely hot climates but also in lowland areas with increased humidity levels. In Central America, those most affected have been men farming sugar cane, whereas rice farmers on the paddy fields are at most risk in Sri Lanka.\n\"When you go into the highlands, you don't find any CDKu,\" said Tewodros Rango, an \nenvironmental researcher \nat Duke University.\nRango, like many experts, believes the working environment could be to blame. The intense heat could be causing farmers to sweat excessively and become extremely dehydrated while they are exposed to intense moisture in the atmosphere and with inadequate access to water. \n\"One thing they all have in common is, they are hot,\" Pearce added.\nFarm work in these equatorial regions, particularly among sugar cane farmers, is considered to be the most strenuous work in the world, with the average sugarcane worker drinking 7 liters of water and losing 5\u00bd pounds (2\u00bd kilograms) of weight per day-long shift, according to Pearce.\n\"This is the most plausible hypothesis,\" Rango agreed. \"We want to quantify the dehydration.\"\nBut it's not so simple. \nLifestyle factors could also be playing a role, such as the consumption of alcohol and tobacco, which can also lead to dehydration and damage the kidneys over time. In interviews with almost 30 patients with CKDu, Rango found that most of them smoked and drank alcohol regularly.\n\"I think this and the working environment account for the cause,\" he said. \nWhat were the suspects?\nUntil now, a range of causes has been thought to be to be behind the disease, including pesticides, agrochemicals and heavy metals in drinking supplies.\n\"Increasingly, the finger is being pointed at water,\" said \nHerath Manthrithilake\n, head of Sri Lanka programs at the \nInternational Water Management Institute\n. He has witnessed the epidemic progress and grow into other regions of Sri Lanka, with tens of thousands now estimated to have been affected, according to studies.\n\"It was thought that cadmium and arsenic (in the water) were to blame, but there was no conclusive evidence for either of them,\" he said.\nIn 2013, Rango conducted a study in Sri Lanka, in partnership with the water institute, testing water supplies in affected and nonaffected regions for traces of these heavy elements. It found levels to be extremely low -- in both the water and urine samples.\n\"We couldn't link these trace elements with CKDu,\" Rango said. \nBut this hasn't taken water out of the running as a suspect, as experts including Manthrithilake believe it still has a role to play. \"We are zeroing in on groundwater,\" he said.\nWith the majority of people in Sri Lanka's affected regions relying on wells as their source of water, Manthrithilake now hypothesizes that fluoride and calcium in rock at the bottom of these wells could be inadvertently consumed when water is pumped out.\n\"We need to test the water coming out of these wells,\" he said.\nHowever, Pearce doesn't believe the case for water is strong enough. \"(This wouldn't) explain why the disease is more common in men than women,\" he said.\nWhat can be done?\nThe debate will continue, both in the meeting this week and into the future, but for now, experts agree on two things: that there's a need for a comparable survey and that the answer to the mystery is still years away.\nUntil then, the priorities include earlier diagnosis and improved working conditions in such intense heat. Initial symptoms of the disease are nondistinct, such as tiredness and appetite loss, meaning people are usually diagnosed late, when damage to the kidney is extensive and irreversible. The only option at this stage is dialysis, which is not always available or accessible.\nThis timing of visiting health care services is also delayed when families rely on the income from workers.\n\"The farmers only go to the hospital once they can't function very well,\" Rango said. \"But early diagnosis can be done at the community level.\"\nAs the Sri Lankan government debates its approach, the real help will need to come from expanded resources to enable treatment, while the detectives continue their investigations.\n\"Emphasis is placed on preventive action, provision of services and care, social interventions as well as research,\" WHO spokeswoman Karen Reidy said. \"The recommendations generated from the (meeting) highlight all of these areas and represent the priority interventions for implementation.\"", "How to stop a kid's meltdown": "If you have kids and you've experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what I mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions -- embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. Even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn't seem to work when your child is at wit's end and unable to calm down.\nWe recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new CNN Digital video series called \n\"Parent Acts.\"\n Since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.\nPauline Hilborn, a mom of two in New York City, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is \"7-years-old but sounds more like 13.\"\nCase in point: Hilborn's daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer Ariana Grande, but felt like her mom didn't do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.\n\"She came out crying and said, 'Ariana Grande's ponytail is here not here,'\" said Hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.\n\"I was at a loss for words,\" she said. \"I had no idea what to say but my husband said, 'Well, she's right you know,' which didn't help the situation.\"\nDebi, another mother of two in Manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums. When I asked her son what a meltdown is, he told me it's when you cry a lot. When I asked him to imitate one, he said he keeps screaming until his mom lets him have whatever it is that he wants at that moment.\n\"I completely freeze in those situations,\" she said. \"I lose all rational sense of now what do I do  ... I don't know how to do it without bribing him, so I end up taking away things.\"\nHelp is on the way \nTricia Ferrara\n is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. She's also author of \n\"Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,\"\n a guide book for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children.\nFerrara listened to our parent volunteers imitate exactly what their children do and say during a meltdown, and then offered her advice:\nNo. 1 -- Try to prevent it\nYes, you can actually prevent a meltdown, said Ferrara, a mom of two teens. Kids get tired and hungry, and then they can't tell you what's going on. \"You want to try and maybe not bring a child to places that trigger them,\" and avoid outings at the end of the day when it's still difficult for them to coordinate their emotions with their body, she said. (I wish I had this in mind that time I decided to take my kids, then 2 and 4, grocery shopping right before dinner time. Not a smart move.)\nNo. 2 -- Disregard what other people think\nWhile it may be hard to do, we need to forget about the other people watching us during those cringe-worthy moments when our kids are yelling at the top of their lungs and people are definitely noticing. \"I always say to parents ... you've got to stop, drop and do what you have to do,\" she said. \"Escalating back to the child is not helping anything, because that's more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear.\" Think of yourself as a \"tuning fork,\" said Ferrara. \"The calmer and clearer you can be, the better things will go.\"\nNo. 3 -- Create a small upside for them \nAdults sometimes have to look for creative ways to maintain authority, and eliciting small concessions from your child can go a long way, said Ferrara. \"Create one bit of upside even if it's, 'You take one breath and we count to three together [then] we can get you want you want, and then we'll go home,' she explained. \"What that does is it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation.\" \nNo. 4 -- Don't leave home without a strategy \nThe \"biggest mistake\" parents make is they go into situations \"without a strategy,\" said Ferrara. \"Do you go to the hair dresser without a plan? A business meeting? Go buy a car? No, but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan,\" she said.  \nRemember Debi, the mom who said her son sometimes has meltdowns when he can't get what he wants? Ferrara said before heading out or going anywhere, she could tell her son that how he behaves is going to determine whether he could do something else, such as play with his birthday presents that evening. \n\"And so when he starts to behave in a way that is not acceptable to you, instead of getting into the verbal joust with him, you can say, 'Do you want to play with your birthday presents?' You can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way that he understands,\" said Ferrara to Debi. \"If you rock back a bit and anticipate a little more and be a little more strategic, you might get better results from him,\" she said. \"And after consistency, he's going to know, 'Oh it's a new day.'\"\nNo. 5 -- Help children convey how they feel\nWhen the body is flailing, that often means the language is not working, said Ferrara. For example, in the case of Hilborn, the mom who's daughter melted down after the ponytail disaster, Ferrara said she could have said to her daughter, \"Honey, if you need help, say it. Say 'Mom, I need help changing the ponytail.' That language helps her organize herself.\" \n\"You want your child to have an expectation of things, but she can't beat up on other people to get there, and certainly you can't stand in for that,\" Ferrara said to Hilborn. \"So what you want to do is teach her to say, 'I need help. I want this changed,' and then you can move in a more functional way.\"\nOh, and another piece of advice? Teach Dad how to do the Ariana Grande ponytail! \nHave any good meltdown stories? We all do!

It can for Diemut Strebe, a Boston-based artist who created a replica of Vincent van Gogh's famously amputated ear that is about as close to the real thing as you can get. The artistic experiment may even lead to new advances in the world of science.\nStrebe persuaded Lieuwe van Gogh, the great-great-grandson of Vincent's brother, to donate a chunk of the inside of his ear for the project. (Although it did not take much convincing because, according to Strebe, \"he loved the project right away.\") Then she worked with a \"who's who\" of engineers and scientists to grow Lieuwe's ear cells on a polymer-based scaffold that approximated the shape of Vincent's ear, based on the only known photograph of the artist showing the body part that was famously removed.\nThe result is a piece named \"Sugababe,\" currently on display at the\n Ronald Feldman Fine Arts Gallery \nin New York City, in a show of Strebe's work. The ear, which an art writer called \"\ncreepy\n\" and Stephen Colbert called \n\"the craziest (explicative) thing,\"\n made its debut last year at a museum in Karlsruhe, Germany. It gets is name in part because of the sugar-white color of the ear.\n\"I was looking for a more challenging, inspiring method to create contemporary art,\" said Strebe, a mother of five who started her art career only several years ago. \nStrebe's artistic experiment with the ear began in 2010 but it was inspired by a thought experiment dating back to ancient Greece, called Theseus' paradox. It asks whether an object that has had all of its parts replaced is still the same object. Scientific methods gave Strebe the means to explore this question with \"maybe the most famous romantic and stereotypical image of the artist as a genius,\" Strebe said. \n\"(In general), science and art go very well together,\" she said. \"The Renaissance (period) showed that. Science can produce mediums for art, and perhaps art can give back to science.\"\nCan science imitate art?\nStrebe and her scientist collaborations are trying to create a new version of the ear that would be even more genetically related to the van Gogh original. But in order to do so, they are developing a new technology that would open the door to study a whole group of human diseases.\nAlthough most of the genetic material in the cells that make up \"Sugababe\" is related to Vincent's, the exception is the mitochondrial DNA, which is sort of an auxiliary set of genes that help cells generate energy. Lieuwe van Gogh has different mitochondrial DNA because he descended from a woman unrelated to van Gogh (and Vincent's brother), and mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively through the mother.\nTo find related mitochondrial DNA, Strebe tracked down a descendent of Vincent's sister and got another van Gogh family biological sample. Unlike Lieuwe, this descendent did not have to follow in her great-great-great uncle's footsteps and cut off some ear; mitochondrial DNA can be extracted from cells in the saliva.\nNow comes the hard part. Strebe turned to Jef Boeke, director of the Institute for Systems Genetics at NYU Langone Medical Center, and his research lab. The scientists are cloning the mitochondrial DNA of Vincent's sister's descendant, and then they will attempt to replace the mitochondrial DNA in Lieuwe's cells with that of the other donor.\nNo research group has ever convincingly managed to deliver cloned mitochondrial DNA into cells, Boeke said. Although it is fun to be part of a cool art project, figuring this out has important medical applications, and is \"absolutely the reason we are involved with this,\" he added. \nThe ability to introduce cloned mitochondrial DNA into cells would give researchers a new platform to study mitochondrial diseases, which affect about one in 5,000 people, Boeke said. Researchers could mutate the cloned DNA and see how it affects cells growing in the lab. They could tease apart the cellular processes that go awry in diseases such as \nLeber hereditary optic neuropathy\n, which causes vision loss;  and \nMERRF Syndrome\n (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers), which causes seizures and muscle dysfunction.\nMore than just a cool \"creepy\" art piece\nThe principles that Strebe used to create \"Sugababe\" are the same ones scientists have been developing for the past several decades to make all matters of organs, including a U.S. Army-funded project to engineer ears for wounded soldiers, said Robert Langer, a professor of chemical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nBut that's not to say that the making of \"Sugababe\" does not make a contribution to the field of tissue engineering. \"Anytime anybody does anything in an area like this, I think it advances it. You learn something...every scaffold that you make is kind of different,\" said Langer, who consulted with Strebe on her project.\nStrebe also worked with an auditory scientist to give \"Sugababe\" a hearing component. Although the ear itself does not hear --  as Strebe put it, \"the ear is missing Vincent to make that work\" -- the piece does have a microphone that visitors can speak into. Then a computer program processes the sound into a series of static bursts, which mimic how the brain perceives sounds. The bursts play back through a speaker for visitors to hear.\n \nAlthough the ear itself probably does not help advance auditory science, it would be nice if it helped visitors get a better sense of how the brain interprets sound, said Peter Cariani, a senior research scientist at the Hearing Research Center at Boston University. Cariani built the sound system for \"Sugababe.\"\nFor Strebe's part, she hopes visitors to the ear will not simply write it off as \"creepy.\" \n \"These images are very important documents of our time and that try to capture our time,\" Strebe said.", "How to break your bad eating habits": "Instead of reading labels and counting calories, you might just want to try focusing on your habits.\nResearch shows habits can become so ingrained that we often don't realize we're doing them -- and this can be a big problem when it comes to mindless snacking.\nIn fact, once a task becomes second nature, your brain essentially shuts down, according to \nBrian Wansink\n, author of \n'Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think.'\n\"Habits become so automatic ... our environment ends up facilitating a good habit, but it also ends up facilitating a bad habit.\"\nThe key then is to create good food habits and stick to them.

Adhikari is the lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in the journal \nNature Communications\n.\nThe silver lining\nThe name of the hair color thief is IRF4, a gene that probably acts like a cog in the machine in a cellular process that churns out melanin pigment in the hair follicle. Graying happens as follicles gradually stop producing the pigment that gives hair its color, a process that happens at different rates for different people.\nThe researchers made the connection between the gray hair trait and a specific variation in IRF4 seen exclusively among Europeans, who are known to have a higher chance of premature graying than people of other descent, he added.\nThe silver lining (pun intended) is that the finding \"gives researchers further leads in what they can investigate if they want to develop a drug to prevent or delay hair graying,\" Adhikari said. If more studies can confirm the role of this cellular pathway in graying, researchers could look for proteins or enzymes that might be lacking in the pathway among those salt-and-pepper cases and perhaps find a way to regulate them with a pill or cream, he added. \"But, of course, it will take quite a bit of research,\" Adhikari said.\nWhy do gray hairs make us cringe?\n\"It is because it makes you confront your mortality ... even though we are long from the time when gray is associated with the end of life,\" said Vivian Diller, a research psychologist in private practice in New York City.\nWhen CNN's own Anderson Cooper started going gray in his 20s, he wrote that it was \"\na total shock\n.\" It took him years to learn to \"give in to the gray.\"\nREAD: Lock of John Lennon's hair sells at auction\nParadoxically, the identification of a gene that could be linked to graying could come as welcome news to the many folks out there who, like Cooper, had trouble seeing the positive, gravitas-affirming power of gray.    \n\"I think (people) will feel less like they are out of control,\" Diller said. \"If we know that it is in your genes you will get gray hair at a certain age, no matter what you do, you will say, 'OK, I'll just color it. I'm not going to pluck them out, and I know it doesn't mean I'm old and dying,'\" she said. \n50 shades of cool\nEven before these genetic reassurances, there seemed to be a \nburgeoning trend \nof women fully embracing the gray. Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Pink have all stepped out with white or gray locks that they appear to have intentionally dyed. \n\"There's a beautiful snowy white, silky white, white with blond. Making white hair a fashion statement is growing, in part because women are rebelling against the tradition that you must avoid white and gray at all cost,\" Diller said. \nBelieve it or not, Adhikari found evidence that the IRF4 gene variation linked to gray hair may have actually been selected tens of thousands of years ago in human evolution. Although there was probably pressure for our ancestors to possess hair of a certain density and shape (curly or straight) in different climates, there might have been sexual selection for genes linked to hair color which also end up affecting gray hair. \nThat is not to say that silver foxes were the object of desire in the cave world. It's probably more likely that blond hair, which the study found was also linked to the same version of the IRF4 gene, was enriched in the population because it stood out among all those darker complexions, Adhikari said.\nGenes versus gray-inducing environment\nAlthough the current study only uncovered one gray hair gene, there are probably at least several other genes that play a role in stripping us of our hair color, Adhikari said. \nBut we are not entirely at the mercy of the genes. The current study found that environmental factors controlled about 70% of cases of hair graying. Genes were only responsible for about 30%, at least in the Latin American cohort. \n\"The study confirms that (going gray) is at least a mix of genes and environment,\" said Dr. Paradi Mirmirani, a dermatologist at Kaiser Permanente in California. \nREAD: Heads up! The billion dollar hair care industry\nThere is evidence that stress and smoking can increase your risk of going gray. Just look at \nPresident Obama\n, Mirmirani said. Pollution and spending too much time in the sun can also increase the odds that those silver strands will start showing up.  ", "For pro stair climbers, sky's the limit": "Yet, as sports go, stair climbing is relatively new\n \nand has only a small pool of professional competitors. Those who are ranked for speed are in the hundreds, not thousands. The winners earn modest prizes, usually swag from sponsors, not cash. \nIt's a sport that might have started as gimmicks or publicity stunts. But now, with an official organization and a global circuit of races, stair climbing is a legitimate, if niche, amateur sport. Participation is climbing, but for now, the limited size of this upwardly mobile community has its own upside.\n\"We're like a family,\" said Lisa Zeigel, a tower runner since 2001 who is ranked seventh in the United States.  \"We hang out. We have our own Facebook group. I've never been in a group that bonds like that. We feel so grateful for having each other.\" \nThey call each other \"step siblings\" or \"step sibs.\" \"My girlfriends are my 'step sisters'!\" Zeigel said.\nIn buildings 75 to 90 floors high, the race is roughly the exertion and length of a 5K run. It's usually all uphill, with a pack of climbers who try not to bump each other as they double-step it up dozens of flights. \nThe whole thing is over in minutes. The fastest time for the 1,576 stairs of the Empire State Building run this year was 10 minutes, 36 seconds.o\nGearing up\nTraining for races is ideally done in the stairwell of a tall building, if you can get access. Barring that, outdoor structures, such a parking deck, are good, especially there's an elevator for going down. (Runners' legs are so rubbery after a race or long training that it's safest to return to earth by elevator.) \nStair machines might help with overall cardio, but \"climbing real stairs is much harder than using a stair stepper in the gym,\"  explained Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. \"With the stepper, you are pushing the stairs down instead of pulling yourself up against gravity.\"\nSome tower runners like to use a machine called a Jacob's Ladder, which works arms and legs. Zeigel recommends a rowing machine and climbing sand dunes, if you can swing that. The sand works the key climbing muscles, but with added resistance.\nThere's no special gear required. Sticky-palmed gloves used by football wide receivers help grip the railing, which the athletes use to increase speed. \nAs for running shoes, the lighter the better, and some use those odd-looking \"toe shoes\" that wrap each individual toe.  Some male climbers have even been known to shave legs and head to reduce air resistance. \n\"I tried not to look at each floor number,\" suggested Patty Collins, a full-time para-athlete who lost a leg in 2007 and did her first tower run this winter. Her other tip was to chew gum or suck on a lozenge while climbing because the dry, stale air of stairwells is known to induce coughing fits. \n\"Most people say they think it's too hard,\" said Zeigel. \"But if you train slowly and do it enough and keep at it, it gets easier.\" \nStair-ing contest\nTower running as a sport is reminiscent of George Mallory's fabled line about why he (stair) climbed Mount Everest: \"Because it's there.\" \nRunning up stairs is so ordinary that it might seem silly to organize races around it. But the same could be said for simply running, jumping or throwing something heavy -- which are all Olympic events.\nWhat makes stair racing unique is its fusion of athleticism and architecture. For those on the tower-climbing circuit, it's the venues that are inspiring as well: the Empire State Building, the Calgary Tower, the Eiffel Tower.\nIn fact, the closest the sport gets to an origin story is the 1905 \"Stair Climbing Championship\" up the Eiffel Tower. Sponsored by the daily newspaper Le Sport, it featured 227 competitors categorized by runner, walker, child, veteran and \"soccer player.\" The winner ran the 600 stairs to the second-level platform in 3 minutes, 12 seconds, and won a Peugeot bike.\nToday, there are tower races all over the world, in most major cities, with varying degrees of officialness. The two organizing groups that advise on timing and safety are \nTowerRunningUSA\n and, in Europe, the \nTowerrunning World Association\n, or TWA. In order for a race to be officially recognized, the finish times must be accepted by the TWA. Runners with the fastest times earn invitations to some of the more coveted stair races, such as the Empire State Building Run-Up.\nThere's no resisting the Empire\nThe \nEmpire Run-Up\n is quintessential New York: Everyone is in a hurry. The race is over in a matter of minutes. And there's a party afterward. \nThe first year the famous art deco building hosted a tower run was 1978, relatively early in the trend of organized tower races (Eiffel Tower notwithstanding). It started as a publicity stunt to promote the New York City Marathon. But the number of runners grew year after year until the race became a victim of its own success, with a potentially dangerous mob of hundreds of runners scrambling up the stairwell every year. \nNew management of the race since 2014 has scaled back the numbers and organized them into waves, with the elite runners going first. Organizers also moved the timing to night to be less disruptive to the office workers. \nIn addition to invited professionals and charity teams, there is a lottery for the general public. Thousands enter, and 75 are chosen.\nFor many runners, some of whom came from as far away as Singapore this year, the appeal is the iconic building itself. \n\"I love movies, and 'King Kong' is one of my favorites,\" said Rudy Smith of Louisiana, at 73 the oldest lottery winner this year. \"So that was it. That was the whole excitement for me.\"\nIt starts in the lobby with a dash and ends 86 floors later in a wipeout. At this year's race in February, the finish line -- on the observation deck at the base of the needle nose where Kong waved off airplane attacks -- was a wild rush of wind and music. The first runners arrived just more than 10 minutes after the start, while \"New York Groove\" by KISS' Ace Freeley blasted.\nAs chilly gusts whipped across the platform and Manhattan twinkled silently below, the deck began to fill with athletes crawling or limping around while their legs slowly regained power. The only way it could have been more exciting is to add Kong.\nFor security and space reasons, there are no public spectators. But that's OK with Zeigel. \"It was a Zen-like experience. It's totally quiet; you hear your breath,\" she said. \n\"It a personal, introspective sport,\" added Anthony Malkin, chairman and CEO of Empire State Realty Trust, which hosts the Run-Up. \"It's a triumph of the individual.\"\nJust as the monotony builds for some runners around the 80th floor, they start feeling cool breezes from the roof and hearing the sounds of music and cheering from the other runners. Then, they burst out on to the observation deck. \n\"It's like a runner's high, multiplied many times,\" Zeigel said.\n\"The pain is like nothing ever before,\" she added, but \"as soon as it's over, you want to do it again.\"\nAfter the awards ceremony, where glass statues of the Empire State Building are handed out, the jolly, supportive group of runners headed to the State Bar in the building's lobby, where the party continued late into the night.\nKnees-to-know basis\nStair climbing is an excellent full-body, high-intensity workout focused on lower-body strength, power, flexibility and weight loss. \n\"It strengthens you, and your cardiovascular fitness goes way up,\" Zeigel said. \"It makes other cardio easier by comparison.\" \nWhen she had her VO2 max (a measure of oxygen uptake) analyzed, it \"was off the charts,\" she said. Oxygen uptake is a good measurement of muscle function, endurance and speed\nAnd it's a great way to tone thighs, calves and glutes. \"Stair-climbers look lean but are more more muscular than long-distance runners,\" Zeigel said. \n\"The main difference between running and climbing stairs is gravity,\" Gupta explained. \"As you climb stairs, you are fighting gravity, which is a powerful force. Just imagine running up a hill that is several stories high.\"\nBut how's all that stepping on your legs, and more specifically, your knees? Overall, it's probably good for most people because climbing strengthens the knee and the leg muscles that support the joint. \nAs for shedding weight, a 30-minute run up stairs can burn nearly \n500 calories\n. Burning excess weight is also good for your knees because every 10 pounds of being overweight adds \n30 to 60 pounds\n of pressure on your knees with every step. \nTower running might not be for everyone. Stairs can strengthen a knee or lower back, or they can exacerbate problems. So, if you're having issues on either front or with your heart or lungs, talk to a doctor first. And if you don't have a good technique, you risk developing muscle strain issues with the repetitive turns. Those considering running their first stair race should be aware that there are also risks of tripping, especially when there are too many runners at once, so be careful and use common sense in crowded stairwells.\nBut then there is the mental benefit. \"It's feels so amazing, better than I would ever feel from running,\" Zeigel said. \"I feel that if I can do these tall buildings, I can do any challenge in my life.\"\n\"It was frightening at first. I was a little scared,\" said Smith, who has run 56 marathons on seven continents, at least 25 triathlons and many duathlons and half-marathons, and who entered his first Ironman at age 68. \n\"Can I really do it? Can I get to the top?\" he asked himself at the bottom of the Empire State Building. \n\"But then when the gun went off, that was a different story.\" \nThe experience these tower runners get from crossing the finish line with their \"step-siblings\" cheering them on delivers a heady double hit of runner's high: physical euphoria combined literal height. It's a view to a thrill. ", "How do astronauts handle their periods?": "But when they prepare for these journeys, one added challenge faces them: How should they handle their period?\n\"When women first went into space, it wasn't known what the effects would be,\" said Varsha Jain, gynecologist and researcher at \n Kings College London\n, who was among the authors of a \nrecent paper\n on menstruation in spaceflight.\nIt turns out that while most systems in the human body are heavily affected during spaceflight, the female menstrual cycle doesn't seem to change at all.\n\"It can happen normally in space, and if women choose to do that, they can,\" Jain said.\nA few waste-disposal facilities on board the international space station can handle human blood but were not originally designed to do so, according to Jain. A further practical issue of women having their period in space is the added weight and calculations of taking items such as tampons and sanitary towels.\nAstronauts at NASA undergo individual assessments tailored to their needs, mission duration and physiology, according to a spokesman. \"Protocols allow for several choices, the individual treatment selected for any particular astronaut is a private matter between the astronauts and their flight surgeon.\"\nIn reality, extensive practicalities aren't really a concern. Most women opt instead to use contraceptives and put their periods on hold, both in preparation for and during spaceflight, as highlighted in the\n paper\n by Jain and her colleagues.\n\"NASA flight surgeons are finding female astronauts just don't want to have to deal with their periods,\" Jain said.\nWhen the space shuttle was in operation, missions would take a few weeks on average, enabling astronauts to use oral contraceptives to time their cycles accordingly, but missions to the International Space Station can last for up to six months, and any mission to Mars could involve journeys of up to three years -- putting periods on hold for much longer periods of time.\nRead: The closest thing on Earth to a mission to Mars\nWhat are the risks?\n\"No research has been done on long-term use of contraceptives in space,\" Jain said. \"What we do know from long-term use on Earth is, you can take it back to back for many years.\"\nThe evidence is fairly strong for the 3 billion-plus women here on Earth, but while Jain's team is eager to stress that these risks remain low when in space, the studies backing this up are hard to come by, mainly because the numbers available to study on are so few. \nThe paper highlights the now-common use of the combined oral contraceptive pill among female astronauts. \"[These] have been used for a number of years,\" Jain said. \nBut with a mission to Mars likely to take years, the question of payload could come back into play due to the weight of the many pills required for the journey: an estimated 1,100 pills, according to the paper.\nInstead, Jain is drawing attention to the now widespread use and availability of more longer-lasting options, known as long-acting reversible contraceptives, which are thought to be a safe and reliable alternative, in terms of both health and waste. \"[There is] no packaging to dispose, and they dispel concerns regarding stability during storage,\" the authors write.\n\"This is the first time we can say these options are safe to use and available,\" Jain said.\nPrevious concerns about health risks in general related to factors such as exposure to radiation when in space and risk of blood clots during spaceflight, but anecdotal evidence from missions has revealed no such risks in practice. \n\"No one has experienced anything,\" said Virginia Wotring of the Center for Space Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, who co-wrote the paper. \nShe stresses that there is, however, evidence against myths of blood flow reversing when women have their periods in microgravity. \"That has long been debunked,\" she said.\nThe benefit of bone density\nTaking the birth control pill, however, could in turn provide some benefits for female astronauts on their return to Earth. \"It could potentially be advantageous,\" Jain said.\nThe benefit comes down to one of the key physiological challenges facing all astronauts -- male and female -- who spend extended periods of time in microgravity: their bone density.\n\"The lack of gravity means astronauts lose bone mineral density,\" Jain said. This happens as there are no loads acting on the bone to strengthen it. \"And what we do know is that estrogen can help with density.\" \nEstrogen is a key ingredient of the birth control pill, and its use could therefore be putting females at an advantage during space missions. The hormone is, however, lacking from the longer-acting contraceptives.\n\"Estrogen is protective of bone,\" Wotring said. \"[So this] could reduce loss.\" \nWotring plans to investigate this further but in the meantime will be working with female astronauts to keep their cycles primed, wherever they are in the universe.", "Living in shadows: A child's rare disorder": "But because of a rare disease, he can't play in the sunlight for very long. \nAlex has X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder with systematic manifestations -- or what's more commonly called \nXLPDR\n. It's so rare that there are only 18 diagnosed cases worldwide.\nAlex's story is part of photographer \nLuca Catalano Gonzaga's\n project, \"Hopeful, 'One of a Kind,' \" that documents invisible diseases.\nWhile many parents pride themselves on being vigilant, it's imperative for Alex's mother, Patrizia, to constantly monitor him. \n\"When he overheats, he risks his life,\" she said. \"A moment of negligence, a delay, and Alex dies.\"\nDays after she gave birth to Alex, her second child, she knew something was wrong. Alex was overly sensitive to light, cried constantly and suffered abdominal pain. He also had a respiratory infection at only 2 months old and was unable to sweat, so he easily overheated. \nThe conflicting symptoms confused doctors. It took three years of hospital visits and Internet research to figure out what might be wrong with Alex. He was finally diagnosed at age 3. \nOnline research also connected Patrizia with Dr. Andrew Zinn, a geneticist from Dallas, who studies XLPDR. The disorder was characterized in 1981 and largely affects males. \nZinn and his team at UT Southwestern Medical Center have recently \ndiscovered the mutation that causes XLPDR\n: the POLA1 gene. Many times, patients with XLPDR are misdiagnosed, like Alex was; identifying the gene will help doctors properly diagnose XLPDR patients in the future. While this discovery will not immediately help to cure those with XLPDR, this enables researchers to work toward one.\nAlex has an ulcerated cornea and suffers from photophobia, meaning that he is incredibly sensitive to light and it can have a painful, blinding effect on him. At such a young age, he's already losing his eyesight.\nAlex's body also lacks the ability to regulate his temperature, so he doesn't sweat, cry or have as much saliva as the average person. Patrizia also has to monitor the temperature of his food so that it doesn't increase his own. As he ages, Alex's symptoms are only expected to worsen. \n\"There is no therapy -- only eye drops, body creams, antibiotic for the infections and monitoring of internal and external temperature,\" Patrizia said.\nGonzaga discovered the story of the Gentile family while studying the phenomenon of rare diseases. His project began in 2015 after reaching out to Patrizia and receiving her permission to tell Alex's story. \nGonzaga visited them three times over the course of a year, capturing Alex's everyday life through black-and-white images. He worried that color images would have detracted from the impact of Alex's story. \nBut he was particularly struck by Patrizia's strength and dedication to helping her son. A self-described stubborn, determined and proud woman, she gave up her job to take care of Alex as well as her daughter. Her husband does shift work to support the family, so he's unable to help much with the children. \nPatrizia also founded an \nassociation\n in 2012 to share what she knows of the disorder and raise awareness so that other families don't have to endure their struggle alone.\n\"Alex's family, in particular his mother Patrizia, taught me what 'never give up' really means -- the importance to come out of the dark corner where one may fall when he feels alone and frightened,\" Gonzaga said. \"The smile of this family is contagious despite the difficulties and the extremely serious risks Alex takes when trying to live the life of any other child.\"\nPatrizia tries to provide as normal of a life as possible for her son. He goes to school and has a supporting teacher and eye therapist to help him navigate any difficulties. But sometimes the other children remind him of the differences -- that his skin looks different because of hyperpigmentation or that he's slower and clumsier. \n\"Alex sees himself like any other child but he's well aware of his conditions,\" she said. \"He loves life and is curious about everything. He (asks) a lot of questions; he's a lively, friendly, kind and sensitive -- but also proud and resolute -- boy. But he's noticing his own limitations. He can't run or play like the other children. He lives at home while dreaming of open-air life. At this moment, he's very angry.\"\nGonzaga's project of documenting Alex and his family is ongoing, and he plans to share their story in a book. He hopes that by pursuing humanitarian photojournalism and focusing his lens on \"invisible people\" will enable them to receive the help and support they need. \nGonzaga also wants the people who see \"The Story of Alex\" to have the same reaction he did: \"A strong spur to take a greater interest in this problem, to systematize cooperation so that scientific research can invest in the development of innovative medicines, even if intended for only a small number of patients. \n\"Anyone suffering from a rare disease often receives a late and complex diagnosis. At best, it will take years.\"", "Zika: Is the U.S. ready for the fight?": "Awaiting your arrival there will be a staff of a dozen entomologists and biologists to study your every move. A fleet of 26 trucks, 11 helicopters and four airplanes stands ready to spray you dead. \nThere are much safer places in the United States for a mosquito to go -- and that's a big problem, according to experts trying to control the spread of the Zika virus as summer approaches. \nIn the United States, mosquito control is done by a patchwork of hundreds of separate authorities, many of them in coastal and Western states. Some, like the Lee County Mosquito Control District, where Fort Myers is located, are said to do an excellent job, but there are concerns that others might not be up to the task. \nToday,\n the Senate passed\n a $1.1 billion compromise bill to fund the fight against Zika. Mosquito control experts hope the money would help shore up weaknesses in the nation's pesticide defenses. \nThe big fear is that a mosquito carrying Zika could bite a pregnant woman, and her baby could develop a devastating birth defect. \n\"If I were a pregnant woman living on the Gulf Coast or in Florida, in an impoverished neighborhood in a city like Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Biloxi, Mississippi; or Mobile, Alabama, I would be nervous right now,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, \nwrote in a recent opinion piece\n in The New York Times. \nA labor-intensive proposition\nThe comparison between mosquito control in Lee County, Florida, and some of these other areas is stark. \nLee County's agency\n has a staff of 124 people and an operating budget of $16 million a year. \nOn the other side of the Gulf Coast, in Harrison County, Mississippi, where Biloxi is located, \nthe mosquito control board\n has a staff of 10  and a budget of about half a million dollars. \nRaymond Cuevas, director of mosquito control for Harrison County, said he has confidence his department can handle the Zika threat. \n\"We're stepping up surveillance, and we have an excellent program to begin with,\" he said. \nBut others wonder if smaller programs -- no matter how well-intentioned and hardworking -- might have trouble keeping Zika at bay. \n\"It's very labor-intensive, and some places have better capabilities than others,\" said Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and incident manager for the agency's Zika response. \n\"A number of communities on the Gulf Coast, where there are low socioeconomic levels, are definitely at risk,\" added Joseph Conlon, technical adviser at the American Mosquito Control Association.  \"Many have no control capabilities at all.\" \nKilling the cockroach of mosquitoes \nThe main issue is controlling \nAedes aegypti\n, the species of mosquito most responsible for spreading Zika. \nScientists call it \"the cockroach of mosquitoes.\" \n\"These are really complicated mosquitoes to target. They live inside houses. They live in dark corners,\" said Audrey Lenhart, a research entomologist at the CDC. \n\"They've lived through many, many years of disasters and catastrophes and insecticide sprayings, and they're still with us,\" she added. \nSo far, no one is known to have contracted Zika from a mosquito bite in the continental United States. Everyone in the United States who's caught Zika from a mosquito -- and there have been \nabout 500 cases\n -- was bitten elsewhere. \nBut experts say it's inevitable that infected mosquitoes will start biting people in the United States and spreading the virus. \nIf a mosquito infects someone in Lee County, officials have a plan. \nFor two nights in a row, planes and trucks will spray about 1 square mile around where the infected person lives, according to Shelly Redovan, deputy director of the Lee County Mosquito Control District.\nThen they'll put out mosquito traps in the area. If they catch any that can carry Zika, they'll spray for another two nights and then set out more traps and determine if those mosquitoes can carry the virus. \n\"We'll continue the cycle until we have no more Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus,\" Redovan said, referring to the two species that spread Zika. \n\"We don't mess around. We want to make sure there's no chance of transmission,\" she added. \nLenhart, the CDC entomologist, expressed concern that smaller mosquito control districts might not have the money or staff to launch this level of a mosquito hunt. \n\"It's operationally very complicated,\" she said. \nBut outside spraying by mosquito districts won't kill mosquitoes that are breeding inside homes -- and Zika-spreading mosquitoes love to live indoors. \nThis is particularly concerning in poor, urban areas where people don't have air conditioning and leave their windows open. \nThat's why fighting these mosquitoes will require people, not just authorities, to make changes, such as getting rid of standing water and putting screens on windows. \n\"There's no silver bullet,\" Conlon said. \"It will take a variety of control tools, not just one or two.\" \nAnd there's another step beyond this hunting and killing of mosquitoes: There has to be continual testing to make sure the mosquitoes haven't become resistant to whatever pesticide is being used. \nIn Puerto Rico, for example, Lenhart said, authorities were spraying with a pesticide called \npermethrin\n until it became clear the mosquitoes had become resistant to it. They've since switched to a different pesticide. \nLenhart said it's up to each individual state or mosquito control district in the United States to test for pesticide resistance in their areas. \nSome test mosquitoes for resistance routinely, but others don't, she said. \n\"We're strongly encouraging states that don't have an active insecticide-resistance surveillance program to develop one,\" she said. \"It's a big challenge.\" ", "Why Sandy Hook parents are suing a gun-maker": "On December 14, 2012, Barden's youngest son, 7-year-old Daniel, and Wheeler's son, 6-year-old Ben, were among those killed at \nSandy Hook Elementary School\n in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\"(My husband) Mark and I still have a great life, and we really have to remember that,\" Barden said, adding that their two children bring the family an enormous amount of love and strength. \"We are fortunate with what we have with the two of them.\"\n\"I am a completely different person,\" she said, referring to the life she leads since her son was killed.\nWheeler said his life has changed in every way.\n\"It's not as though there aren't moments of hope and beauty in every second of every day, because there are,\" he said. \"The trick is finding them ... when you don't feel like you can.\"\nWhat gets him out of bed, he said, is the challenge of making sure no more parents or families have to endure what they did: \n20 children and six educators killed\n when a young man unloaded 154 rounds from an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.\nThat rifle is based on an automatic, lightweight weapon originally commissioned by the U.S. military. The only limit to the speed the AR-15 fires is how fast a shooter can pull the trigger for each round.\n \"Each of the kids had three to eight bullets in them,\" Barden said. \"There is just something wrong if that can happen.\"\nWheeler and Barden are part of a potentially precedent-setting lawsuit seeking accountability from \ngunmaker Remington\n.\n\"Our families deserve that day in court,\" said Joshua Koskoff, an attorney representing nine victims' families and a teacher who survived. \"We believe they should be accountable to their fair share of responsibility.\"\nThe case has the potential to make history if it goes to trial. A 2005 federal law, the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act\n, grants gun manufacturers immunity from any lawsuit related to injuries that result from criminal misuse of their product -- in this case the AR-15 rifle.\n\"It's always been a big uphill battle for plaintiffs to sue the gun industry,\" said Georgia State University law professor Timothy Lytton. \"It was even before the immunity (legislation), and it's an even bigger one now.\"\n One exception to the immunity legislation is what's called \"negligent entrustment.\"\n\"Say a gun retailer handed a gun to a visibly intoxicated person, then they're not subject to the immunity,\" said Lytton, who studies gun industry litigation.\nYou might ask: Since Remington did not come into direct contact with the shooter -- that happened at a gun retailer -- how would that apply? The lawsuit argues that the way in which the company sells and markets a military-style weapon to the civilian market is a form of negligent entrustment.\n\"Remington took a weapon that was made to the specs of the U.S. military for the purpose of killing enemy soldiers in combat -- and that weapon in the military is cared for with tremendous amount of diligence, in terms of training, storage, who gets the weapon, and who can use it,\" Koskoff, the attorney for the families, said. \"They took that same weapon and started peddling it to the civilian market for the purposes of making a lot of money.\"\nRemington declined to comment, but in its request to dismiss the suit, the company argued that the 2005 legislation provides it \"complete immunity.\"\nThe families of people who died at\n Sandy Hook Elementary School \ndisagree.\n\"You have to face the consequences for your specific actions,\" Wheeler said. \"Good companies don't need bad legislation to protect them.\"\nBarden said she has a hard time explaining to her two children why the AR-15 was introduced to the civilian market or why manufacturers have targeted teenage boys in video games like \"Call of Duty,\" which features AR-15-style Remington rifles.\n\"It's hard to explain when you really don't know why yourself,\" Barden said. \"It's hard to answer because you know you don't want them growing up being afraid.\"\nBarden would love to see the AR-15 off the market, but she realizes the reality they're up against.\nRemington has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, citing the 2005 law. A state court judge in Bridgeport, Connecticut, will hear from both sides Monday afternoon. If the judge rules in favor of the families, the case would move to a discovery, or fact-finding, phase, and one step closer to a possible trial.\nBarden and Wheeler said they might always have a \"huge, heavy curtain\" hanging over them, but that even if this case doesn't make it to trial, they've already won something.\n\"If it all stops at this point, we have moved the conversation this far,\" Wheeler said. \"And I think that is incredibly important, I really do.\"", "Postures can increase your success in online dating": "Previous studies have shown that nonverbal cues such as a smile or a nod of the head garner interest from potential romantic partners. The gestures have what scientists call \"positive signal value,\" meaning they create the impression that you are warm and friendly, someone others want to be around. \nBut modern courtship rarely lasts long enough to form an impression based on meaningful, real-life interactions. Decisions are made in a matter of minutes, even seconds, with a single swipe in digital dating or a passing encounter in the real world.\nResearch based on two studies found that literally extending yourself could make you more attractive in speed and online dating. In a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that body postures involving widespread limbs and a stretched torso nearly doubles the odds of success compared with closed postures involving limbs held close to the torso, hunched over.\nIt's called \"postural expansiveness,\" and it basically refers to how much space you take up with your torso and limbs. Such \"power postures\" convey dominance and willingness to share those traits with others, study co-author Tanya Vacharkulksemsuk said.\n\"We've seen it in the animal world, that taking up more space and maximizing presence in a physical space is used as signal for attracting a mate,\" Vacharkulksemsuk said. \"By exerting dominance they're trying to signal to a potential mate 'I am able to do things, I have a space in this hierarchy, I have access to resources.' \"\nTo test the theory with humans, Vacharkulksemsuk and her team conducted two field studies, involving speed-dating interactions and using a unnamed leading GPS-based online dating application.\nIn the first study, researchers filmed 144 speed-dating sessions, looking for nonverbal cues through facial expressions, gestures and posture. After the sessions, mate-seekers filled out surveys asking their impressions of each other and whether they wanted to meet that same person\n \nagain -- \"the gold standard of success,\" Vacharkulksemsuk.\nThose who gestured with their hands and moved their arms \"nearly doubled their odds of getting a 'yes' from their partner,\" compared with those who sat still or kept their arms to themselves, she said. \nTo test the hypothesis in online dating, researchers took six heterosexual people and set up two profiles for each person, one with photos in expansive poses, another showing them in contractive postures. They released them in the dating world for a weekend and tallied up the yes marks to see whether the photos caused romantic attraction.\nThey found that profile pictures showing outstretched arms and legs got more yeses than those with crossed arms, excluding responders who picked up on the ruse. Across both studies, the results held true for men and women, though men enjoyed a slight advantage than women, the study found.\nThe researchers believe the rules of attraction hold just as true for humans as they do for animals, and that expansive postures signal not only dominance but openness to sharing resource held by dominant members of a society. \nIt may not be surprising to hear that body language and nonverbal signals are just as important as what you say in initial romantic encounters. But it's nice to hear for a change that it's OK to sit back and relax when it comes to dating.", "What makes a good speller (or a bad one)?": "Within a few years, he made it to the big bee in Washington, too. On his fourth and final trip there in 2008, he won by spelling the word \"guerdon,\" meaning \"something that one has earned or gained.\" Yes, Mishra is a good speller. \nBut everyone knows people who claim they're terrible at it and never were any good. They'd rather just use spellcheck, they say. To Mishra, they'll confess, embarrassed, \"I misspelled 'banana' in the fifth-grade spelling bee\" and just gave up.\nSo what is it that separates the spelling stars from the dictionary-deficient?\nFor those on stage at the National Spelling Bee this week, it often meant five hours a day memorizing words or studying etymology. For the perfectly good, non-bee spellers among us, it might mean they enjoyed reading from an early age. \nAre you a stellar speller? Test yourself with the CNN Spelling Bee\nBut research published this year in the \njournal Brain\n suggests it has something to do with how some people's brains retrieve words -- or don't -- and how we manage to get them out -- or not.\nThe science of spelling\nFor as easy as the teens on stage make it look to spell \"scherenschnitte\" and \"nunatak,\" there's a lot happening inside to produce each word.\nStart with something a little simpler: \"If I tell you a word like 'yacht' and ask you to spell it, maybe you can do it,\" said \nBrenda Rapp\n, a cognitive science professor at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the Brain study.\nIf you heard the word and came up with y-a-c-h-t, it probably emerged from the areas of the brain that hold orthographic long-term memory, where spelling knowledge is stored.\nIf you're not familiar with the term of Dutch origin meaning a recreational watercraft, maybe you'd come up with something like y-o-t or y-a-h-t. You'd probably miss the \"ch,\" but perhaps you'd identify a reasonable spelling that converts the sounds to letters, Rapp said. That process takes place in yet another part of the brain.\nIn either case, you had to hold those letters in mind, convert them into names or shapes and produce them in the right order. That, Rapp said, is orthographic working memory.\nEach component plays a part in spelling a word, and each happens in a different part of the brain's left hemisphere. \nRapp and her colleagues studied 33 people who had trouble spelling after strokes. They struggled with long-term memory, working memory or both. The types of spelling errors they produced often depended on where their brains were damaged.  \nSo what does that mean for those who just can't spell? People who haven't experienced a stroke or been diagnosed with something like dyslexia, which is closely related to dysgraphia, a word for poor spelling? \n\"To be a really good speller, all of these things need to be working well, and they need to be working well together,\" Rapp said. \"You can imagine that in someone who is a poor speller, it suggests either one or more of these systems haven't fully developed, or they aren't interacting properly.\" \nHuman brains aren't specifically designed to do spelling or reading, like they are walking or speaking, Rapp said. Spelling and reading only stretch as far back as written language, several thousand years.\n\"They have to be learned,\" Rapp said. \"They're not built in.\"\nMost of us were trained in spelling and reading in school, but some will still see their emails marred by the angry red spellcheck lines. What you most often hear people complain about, Rapp said, is that they just can't see the word.\n\"For really poor spellers that otherwise seem like normal people of normal intelligence, it could be that ... for some reasons we don't understand, even though they had the same experience, they weren't able to create these long-term memory representations,\" she said.\nThat doesn't mean there's no hope of getting better or finding ways to cope.\nCan you spell i-m-p-r-o-v-e-m-e-n-t?\nMore research is needed to zero in on which techniques works best to teach and learn spelling, but studying followed by testing has helped all of Rapp's stroke patients improve. Repetition -- \"lots and lots of repetition\" -- is key, she said.\n\"They study the word, then try to spell the word. They study the word, then try to spell the word. Study, spell, study, spell,\" Rapp said. \"It's very important to test yourself.\" \nFor the youngest spellers, the key is getting the right words at the right time, said said \nJ. Richard Gentry\n, an eduction consultant and author of \"Raising Confident Readers.\" They're just learning to connect shapes with sounds and to store those patterns in their long-term memories. Some will still struggle, but a foundation that  exposes children to bats, cats, hats and rats, for example, helps them move on to more complex sound and letter combinations, he said.\nSpelling training has gotten more precise as research has improved, he said. No longer should students be presented with a jumble of words taken out of context. But neither does he believe that students should be tested on zingers used mostly in the course of a single reading or writing lesson. \n\"It's great that we're doing more writing, but spelling needs its own time, about 15 minutes a day,\" he said. \"It's all about frequency and patterns.\"\nAnd for adults who aren't aiming for spelling bee success? They can develop \"spelling consciousness,\" Gentry said. That's what he calls an awareness that you should take the time to spell check an email or ask someone to read your memo before you send it.\n\"It's not their fault,\" Gentry said, especially if they have some form of dyslexia or were never really taught to do more than memorize the words on the test.\nEven Mishra, the spelling bee champ, who recently graduated from Columbia University, said memorization can't be the only path to good spelling. \n\"I don't think it's possible to rote memorize the dictionary,\" he said.\nThe markers of spelling success\nMishra is attending the National Spelling Bee this week, and he still sees four qualities among the best-of-the-best spellers.\nThey're self-motivated and a little competitive. It's not about humbling the judges or besting other competitors, he said. The enemy is the dictionary, and the butterflies in their stomachs.\nSecond, they usually have a coach. It's an English teacher or a parent who helps them along the way, drilling them on words and keeping them on schedule. For Mishra, it was his sister, Shruti, who is now in medical school. When he hit a rough patch and struggled with the same words, she reminded him to run around outside or play video games. \n\"You can get frustrated, tired, exhausted,\" he said. \"I needed someone to tell me: This is just a spelling bee.\" \nOf course, it comes down to the work. The competitors are all intellectually curious, Mishra said. Great spellers are often avid readers, and they commit a lot of words to memory,  but they'll also study prefixes, suffixes, foreign languages and definitions that will help them deduce how a word is spelled. \nJust this week, after reading in Mishra's spelling bee bio that he's growing a beard, someone mentioned it was a \"pogonotrophic fun fact.\" Mishra didn't know the word, but he knew that \"pogo-\" or \"pogon-\" referred to a beard and \"-trophy\" meant growing or development.\n\"It's pattern-building,\" he said. \"A lot of really good spellers are really good at patterns.\"\nFinally, Mishra said, great spellers persevere. Many competitors come back to the National Spelling Bee again and again until they've aged out of the competition. They inevitably leave off a letter or buckle after an intense round, but they don't give up and find something else to fill their time. \"\nGrit\n\" is what parents and educators call that quality nowadays.\nMishra doesn't expect everyone to see spelling as an art. But he still feels pangs of sadness when friends admit they've given up on trying.\n\"There are going to be times in your life when you're not going to have a computer or you're not going to be able open your phone,\" Mishra said. \"You're going to bite your lip and say, 'I should have paid more attention.' \"", "Why your brain goes mushy over cute animal videos": "There is a \nwhole channel\n on YouTube devoted to the adventures of tiny hamsters eating tiny food, celebrating tiny birthdays, and having a tiki party. The channel has had more than 29 million views. \nLil Bub,\n a rescued orphan kitty with an extreme case of dwarfism, is an internet sensation. What started as a photo Tumblr called the \n\"BuBlog,\n\" has turned into dozens of \nBuzzFeed \n and \nReddit \nposts, a TV appearance on \"\nGood Morning America\n,\" a \ndocumentary\n, and a line of \nmerchandise\n.  \nCuteness: A matter of survival\nOur love affair with pint-sized furry friends may be a matter of survival. Scientists have found that humans are instinctively attracted to anything that has features similar to those of a baby. Large eyes, chubby cheeks, big foreheads, and generally rounded features, are what humans are attracted to. \"These features are so ingrained in us to respond to,\" said\n Oriana Aragon\n, a Yale psychologist. \nMany scientists believe we've developed this attraction in order to survive. \"Our survival depends on us taking care of our young. It's part of our human species to respond to these features,\" explained Aragon. \nAnd so, when we see those similar type features in animals -- big eyes in big heads on little bodies -- we react the same way we do to babies. In fact, marketers and designers have even applied those types of features to cars to get our attention. Think of the Volkswagan Beetle or the Mini Cooper. \nGetting your cute fix \nBut we aren't mindlessly blinded by cute animals. In fact, studies have found that the pleasure centers of our brains are actually lighting up when we see something cute because there is a rush of dopamine to the brain. It's a response similar to when we eat sugar or have sex. \n\"It is kind of a vice. We want our cute fix. There are entire things devoted to cuteness,\" said Aragon. \n\"It's something that gives us pleasure, and makes us come back. Eating those high-calorie rich foods were essential to our survival in the early days,\" said Aragon. So, seeing and caring for something cute acts in a similar manner in our brain; we see a cute baby, and instinctively reach out to cuddle it, our brain gets a dopamine boost to reward us, and boom -- we're happy! \nEmotions vs. expressions\nHave you ever found yourself wanting to pinch a puppy or eat a baby's cheeks because they're so cute? If you think about survival, that actually seems contrary to caring for a child. Why would anyone want to eat their baby?\nBut as humans, we have a whole host of expressions on our faces that don't at all match our emotions on the inside. Think about tears of joy, or screaming out of excitement watching your favorite band, or wanting to pinch a baby's cheeks. \nThese expressions that seem contrary to our emotions are called \"dimorphous expressions,\" and scientists believe that this may be a self-regulating mechanism that allows us to keep our emotions in check. Feeling too happy? Balance it out with some tears. Are you ever so frustrated with a situation that you end up laughing because you don't know what else to do? Again, it may be a mechanism to help tamper being overwhelmed with the initial emotion. \n\"That facial feedback sends info back to your brain, and it help scramble that primary emotion. Now the person that was overwhelmed is carried down and goes back to homeostatis. It helps people pull them back,\" said Aragon. \nCute aggression\nAragon has specifically studied cute aggression -- when things are so cute, you can't stand it and exhibit aggressive behavior. In fact, a number of languages have specific words to describe this sensation. Filipinos say \"gigil,\" which describes the urge to grit your teeth or pinch cheeks. The French say \"mignon a croquer,\" which literally translates to \"So cute that you want to munch it!\" \nTo test it, Aragon and her team presented people with pictures of baby and adult versions of animals such as elephants, ducks and cats. Ninety participants viewed these pictures while holding bubble wrap. When they viewed the baby animals the participants popped more bubbles than when they viewed the adult animals. \nCreating focus with cuteness\nA similar study in Japan\n found that participants performed better on these high concentration tasks when they viewed images of cute animals versus pictures of food or other non-cute photos. \nSo next time you are caught watching cute animal videos at work, you can tell your boss you aren't procrastinating. You are increasing your productivity. ", "After years in U.S., burned Iraqi boy hopes to help others": "His face was hardened into rivers of scar tissue that kept him from being able to open his mouth.\nMasked men had doused him in gasoline\n and set him on fire outside his own home.\nI remember his anger, which was so deep for a child so young. His parents were at a loss. All they wanted was their little boy back -- and to hear him laugh again. \nWe reported his story in 2007 and received an instantaneous and overwhelming response. The desire to help Youssif transcended religion, ethnicity and race at a time when Iraqis felt largely abandoned by the outside world.  \nNothing since has felt better than the moment I was able to call Youssif's parents and tell them their little boy would be getting help. The \nChildren's Burn Foundation \nin Los Angeles had picked up the case, and CNN viewers had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his cause. He would soon be flying to Los Angeles.\nI traveled with Youssif and his family from Baghdad to the United States in what can only be described as a mosaic of hilarious, emotional and overwhelming moments. \nRelief spread across his parents' faces as they listened to their son laugh and shriek with joy at the sight of the ocean. This was the first time he had seen it. \nYoussif's mother, Zaineb, had to wipe away tears as a church group asked whether they could pray for her son. They felt welcomed as they entered this new, unknown country. \nOver the years, Youssif has undergone multiple surgeries, and there is still the potential for many more to come. Each is a step toward the finish line, he says. \nIn many ways, he is just like other teens. He is obsessed with soccer and has many close friends, and he loves studying math and science. He still wants to become a doctor, to help others the way doctors helped him.\n\"My doctor helped me out, and that encouraged me to help other people, so he's like my role model,\" explained Youssif.\nThinking of home\nHe doesn't remember the attack and has very little recollection of Baghdad, if any. On occasion, Youssif speaks to his grandparents, who remain in Baghdad, but their conversations focus mostly on family rather than the security situation there.\nBut for his parents, the yearning for their homeland is very real, although they know it is unlikely they will be able to go back to Iraq during their lifetimes. Wissam, Youssif's father, found out his sister has cancer; Zaineb's father passed away two years ago; and it's been nine years since either of them hugged their family.  \nBut visiting is out of the question. We continue not to reveal Wissam's identity on camera due to the potential security risks this would bring his family back in Iraq.\n\"It's a horrible life there. My family says not to even think about visiting them one day. I don't know how they even live there,\" Wissam said. \"I try not to read and see what's going on because whatever I see is sad there, everything is just sad.\"\nYoussif knows how lucky he is. He continues to follow the news out of Iraq about ISIS and the refugee crisis and wonders whether he could have ended up chancing the waters of the Mediterranean. \n\"Mine is easy,\" he said of his journey to the United States. \"CNN helped me out. ... I feel really bad for all the people, all those kids and stuff.\"\nWissam explained how different life would be for Youssif as a teenager if he had stayed in Iraq. \"I don't think he would even want to go out of the house because of his face,\" he said.  \"But as you see him now, he's happy, he's got so many friends. All those surgeries he's going through. It's much better now.\"\nMaking ends meet\nLife as a refugee is not easy, and the family is struggling financially. Wissam has a part-time job and has been looking for more work but had little luck. He recently started a \ncrowdfunding page\n to help him provide in the meantime.\nAs parents, they contemplate moving to a cheaper part of Los Angeles, but Wissam worries about the impact it would have on Youssif, who is currently close to his doctors and based in a community that knows and supports him. \nElsewhere, he would have to start over.\nThe furniture and toys in the family home are mostly donated. The family has three children: Youssif; his younger sister, Aya; and the youngest, Mustafa, who was born in the United States. They all share one room, with Youssif sleeping on a pullout couch, but the children don't let this bring them down.\nYoussif talks about a class project during which he discovered a superhero he related to: Superman.  \n\"Each person had to choose one superhero,\" he explained in perfect English. \"I've been really addicted to Superman recently because I saw the movie and I just like his story as a kid.\"\nThe comic book hero also struggled to be accepted and to fit in but didn't let that keep him from making his mark.\nBut for Youssif today, fitting in is not has hard as it used to be. \"Now, I make friends easily, and everyone is nice to me at my school. Some of them even treat me like a brother.\"\nNine years ago, he told me that the kindness of strangers exists, and he was right. The outpouring of support for Youssif by CNN viewers showed us that we needed to provide a way for our audiences to get involved in stories like this. This led to the creation of the \n Impact Your World\n initiative, which has helped raise funds, find volunteers and make an impact for those in need over the last nine years. \nToday, Youssif continues to remind us of the importance of kindness. In a world where fear of \"the other\" is growing, where the building of barricades and rejection feeds directly into the narrative of terrorist organizations, he is a reminder of the transformative power of compassion. ", "Champion pool player turns pain into will to win": "I was told that my back was crooked, and my doctor was going to straighten it. It seemed pretty simple. Two days later, I went into surgery and woke up in a living hell. Implanted in my back were two 18-inch Harrington rods. \nI was in excruciating pain. I felt as if I was being burned alive from the inside out. Through tears, I looked to my mom for comfort. I wanted to scream but couldn't. Under the influence of heavy pain medications, moans were the only sounds I could muster.  No one told me the surgery was going to hurt, and I was not prepared.\nAfter the surgery, I was left with a long bloody Frankenstein scar down the center of my back. \nIn the hospital, I was suited in an enormous heavy cast and with severe pain I was forced to sit up. Several times a day I was lifted up and made to walk. \nFor a while, I could only make it from the bed to the door. Eventually I was fitted for a plastic brace that went from the base of my neck to my pelvic bone. It was rigid and contained Velcro straps that were fastened by metal rungs. I hated it. I felt like a monster. \nMy confidence was shattered, and I felt as if there wasn't anyone I could talk to. \nIt didn't help that I was one of a few Korean children born into a predominantly black neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. In addition to having to wear an ugly brace, I was called horrible names such as \"Ching Chong,\" \"Cholly Wong\" and \"Chinky\" on my walks to school. I didn't fit in anywhere.\nIn my teenage years, I struggled to find acceptance. I looked to boys and pot for attention. I became a teenage delinquent. I was hanging out late. I drank. I smoked. I was disrespectful to my parents. I was spiraling out of control in search of something to give me life meaning. Until I found an escape in playing pool. \nAt 18, I visited one of New York City's trendiest pool halls. I saw an older gentleman gracefully playing pool. It was if he made the cue ball dance. He took control on the table and everything about him was confident and calm. After watching his graceful style, I was hooked.\nI would practice for up to 30 hours at a time. Despite intense back pain, I felt as if playing pool healed me. \nIt allowed me to not care who was watching or what people thought about me. And when my back would fail me with endless bouts of pain, I figured out ways to get healthier so I could stay at the table longer. I wanted to be the best. The more I played, the more I loved it. \nWhile others sat in front of the TV watching sports or reality shows or went to movies or parties, I felt like I was gaining on them. If I wanted to be the best, I had to sacrifice more. I was prepared to do that.  \nI started eating healthier, and strengthening my body. Even after hours of practicing when I was forced to rest in bed, I mentally prepared by visualizing myself playing perfect pool. Still emotionally scarred from my painful childhood, I had a lot of work to do on my confidence. So I faked it and emulated the qualities and fundamentals I saw the in great players around me. I pushed myself until I believed without a doubt that I would be the best. I was willing to do whatever it took to get there.\nAlthough it may sound cliche, pool became my oxygen. Really. \nI could no longer go back to my life without it because in pool I finally found my passion and purpose. I started growing my hair long to cover the scar on my back. I earned the name \"The Black Widow\" because I lured my opponents to the table and ate them alive.\nI focused on every perfect swing. My bridge was perfect. My stance was aligned, balanced and had clearance. I had a slow back swing and a smooth follow through. Pool is just as much a head game as it is a physical game. \nI turned pro at 21 and became No. 1 in the world 18 months after that. I had prize money, sponsors and fame. But with my success came lots of criticism. I was accused of \"not paying my dues\" and only getting certain opportunities \"because I was pretty.\" Of course, pretty doesn't make the balls go in, and I paid my dues. I just figured it out in less time. \nAfter earning the title of No. 1 in the world, I began to consider ways I could use my platform to make a difference. According my manager at the time, it \"was good for publicity.\" The only thing I could think of was scoliosis. I began to meet people with bodies shaped like mine or worse. What was considered at first a great PR move became a life-changing experience. \nDuring one of my early talks on my private battle with scoliosis, I met a young woman who helped me realize that my battle with the disease was much bigger than me. \nThe young woman shared that she, too, was diagnosed with scoliosis and was going to school without her brace. Like me, she hated wearing it.  She started to feel like there was no hope. Then she said that after hearing me, she felt like a weight had been lifted and she could genuinely smile. The young woman then burst into tears in my arms, and I cried, too. \nThat's when it really hit me. I realized that while people may notice the challenges you are going through, what is most important to them is how you respond. Simply put, I kept getting out of bed, even when I truly believed I couldn't. \nTo date, I have had more than 10 neck and back surgeries. \nI have developed multiple conditions including deteriorated discs, degenerative disc disease, carpal tunnel syndrome and severe sciatic pain. I have bursitis in both shoulders and both hips. A few years ago, I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. There's not a minute that goes by that I'm not in pain.  \nMy symptoms are managed with an extensive treatment plan. Each day I take a large number of anti-inflammatory medications and muscle relaxers. I also take chemotherapy pills and undergo infusion therapy. \nYet in spite of it all, I have to keep going.  \nToday I am strong. Not because I \nfeel\n strong, but because I keep going even when I think I can't. I have learned that being brave is not the absence of fear but the courage to face it. It is pushing through discomfort, weakness, fear, sadness and doubt. \nIt is in these moments when you find out who you really are and who you were meant to be. ", "6 ways to improve your IQ": "The jury is out on whether these techniques are truly effective in improving intelligence, but studies have shown that \nyour IQ can change\n -- so why not give it a try? \n\"At least in the short term you can get significantly higher scores on all sorts of cognitive tests,\" says\n Dan Hurley\n, an award winning science journalist and author of \"Smarter: The New Science of Building Brain Power.\"\nWith this in mind, here are a few suggestions to boost your brain power -- and health in the process.\n1. Learn to play an instrument\nA \nstudy of older adults\n found that those who regularly took on new hobbies -- such as learning digital photography or making quilts -- scored better in memory tests after three months compared to those who did non-intellectual or low cognitive engagement activities.\nBut for people of any age looking to try something new, picking up a musical instrument might be the key to boosting the most brain cells.\n\"There are studies showing that learning a new musical instrument is associated with\n improved intellectual abilities\n,\" says Hurley, who adds that musicians have long been observed to be smarter than the average person. \nSo maybe it's time to turn your rock star dream into a reality?\n2. Eat brain food\nThe \nsmarter you eat\n, the smarter you could stay, especially as you age -- but evidence remains limited for which food works best. \nRecent research published in the journal \nNeurology\n found that improving overall diet quality is an important factor for lowering the risk of memory loss and thinking ability. \nIn terms of actually improving cognitive function, \nfurther research\n found that a Mediterranean style diet containing olive oil and nuts -- rich in antioxidants -- might just do the trick. The monounsaturated fatty acids in avocados are also thought to help protect nerve cells in the brain and augment the brain's muscle strength. \nHurley is keen to point out, however, that there are no clear answers when it comes to your diet boosting your IQ. He argues that \"the whole field of diet research is famously fuzzy,\" with some advertisements and claims turning out to be nonsense, or not standing up to scrutiny, such as theories that \nomega-3 or other supplements\n can reduce cognitive decline.\nBut if you're a fan of healthier snacking there's no harm in having an extra helping of chard or grazing on nuts, berries and seeds -- to name a few -- which are a great source of vitamins and antioxidants to make you a lean, green, thinking machine.\nRead more: Five ways to eat yourself healthier\n \n3. Relish your sleep\nWho doesn't love a duvet day? The U.S. \nNational Sleep Foundation\n advises that seven to nine hours a night are optimal for most of us to function as we should.\n\"Your brain is, generally speaking, making new neurons during sleep,\" argues Hurley. According to the\n National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\n (NINDS), sleep helps our nervous system to function properly, with some experts believing nerves use the period we sleep to shut down and repair themselves -- helping our brains work better.\n\"If you don't do it you're really disabling yourself,\" says Hurley.\nMissing a whole night's sleep can cause nerves to malfunction and the overall functioning within your brain to become reduced. Your visual memory and ability to learn are also thought to be vulnerable to sleep deprivation -- sleep hygiene seems the way to go.\nRead more: Sleeping late? Napping all the time? What your sleep says about your health\n4. Get physical\nA good work out not only builds your muscles, it also builds your mind. The \nAlzheimer's Association\n recommends regular exercise as this is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. And researchers from Stanford have found that even just \ntaking a walk\n will increase your creativity.\nWhether you're young or old, getting out and about is a great way to elevate your heart rate, which increases the blood flow to your brain and body. A good workout can keep you mentally sharp as it reduces potential dementia risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. \n\"Especially if you're not very fit, doing either cardiovascular exercise or strength training can definitely help your brain function,\" says Hurley. This is particularly useful in \nolder adults\n who are doing very little.\n\"It's really the one area of brain training that essentially no one in the field really questions. There are no real skeptics of it,\" Hurley adds.\n5. Avoid stress\nPeople shouting, traffic jams, deadlines, injuries ... recognize these scenarios? Any situation that is highly stressful can seriously impact your mind, according to Hurley. The key to being smart, is focus.\n\"The hallmark of intelligence is being able to focus on a task at hand, block out the rest of the world and zoom in on this thing that you're trying to discriminate between, looking very carefully at a problem,\" he says. When dealing with high levels of stress, it can be difficult to access this mindset. \nA\n recent study \nfound that a variety of cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's or schizophrenia, are worsened by exposure to stress due to dysfunction of the brain's prefrontal cortex. \"When the brain is exposed to discord and people are freaked out and yelling and screaming... the brain does not flourish in that environment,\" says Hurley. \n\"If a person can find peace and tranquility, their brain is going to respond better.\"\n6. Stick around\nAccording to the \nFlynn Effect\n -- which states that general IQ among the population has increased over time --  we are already much smarter than our relatives from a hundred years ago. \nRecent research \nfound that over a series of decades, our IQ scores have gotten better and better.\nUsing modern testing standards, if you were to give an IQ test to people living a century ago they would only score an average of 70 --  the average in the United States today is \nestimated\n to be 98. Professor James Flynn -- who developed the theory -- believes people are now living in a completely different environment where they learn to respond to problems in very different ways. \nSo while the increase in IQ scores has varied globally, the overall advancement of technology and education worldwide means that people thinking more laterally than ever before. \nThis means, hypothetically, that if you make it to 2100 you might find your IQ score has improved.\nCongratulations in advance.", "Rare disorder causes constant hunger": "To change her routine could mean a major meltdown. To change her diet could be catastrophic.\nSuzanne Heijnen has Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic condition that is estimated to affect one out of 10,000 to 30,000 people. Peggy Ickenroth met Suzanne a few years ago, when she was 12, and photographed her family over a two-week period, hoping to learn more about the disease and how it affects people.\nPrader-Willi symptoms can include low muscle tone, developmental delays and difficulty controlling emotions. Indeed, Suzanne has problems with her spine, tires easily and is prone to furious outbursts over minor slights. \nBut the most prominent symptom of Prader-Willi is an insatiable appetite, which can lead to dangerous levels of obesity and myriad other health problems. She has been on a limited diet since age 2 and knew there were strict rules about what she could and could not eat.\n\"When you have an obsession for food and you would like to eat anything, the whole day long, because you never feel sated, it's really hard,\" Suzanne's mother, Gonny Heijnen Corstjens, told Ickenroth. \"We're always aware of the fact that one day she might start to plunder the refrigerator.\"\nSuzanne reveres routine. She feels safe in her home, at school, at judo -- places where she knows exactly how things will unfold. She has the intellectual and emotional development of a 5-year-old, her parents told Ickenroth. They warned that if Suzanne didn't warm to Ickenroth immediately, she probably never would -- and she certainly wouldn't allow Ickenroth to photograph her.\nBut when they met at the family's home in the Netherlands, \"she showed me immediately her room, her favorite toys, her favorite blanket -- like a little girl,\" Ickenroth said. \"She liked to tell about herself.\"\nSuzanne happily allowed Ickenroth to follow her to judo -- an important activity to build her strength and keep her weight under control -- and as she played violin. For years, Suzanne had begged to learn to play, Ickenroth said, and she used a specialized system rather than playing with traditional sheet music.\nSuzanne's parents were devoted to caring for Suzanne and her brother, Thiemo, Ickenroth said. She witnessed warm moments between mother and daughter as they explored their neighborhood on a specialized bike, or as Suzanne's mother helped her in the shower. The family often went to concerts and plays together, although going out in public always felt risky, especially as Suzanne continued to grow.\nOut of nowhere, Suzanne would sometimes scream or sob, reacting to a conversation from days earlier or noticing that an object was moved from its usual place. If she were a toddler, nobody would be surprised, her mother lamented to the photographer. But Suzanne's physical differences are subtle. To many people, she looked like any other teen. \nIckenroth said she wasn't sure at first whether to photograph Suzanne in color or black and white. It didn't take long to decide.\n\"For her things are black or white,\" Ickenroth said. \"I felt like the light was the right thing to do.\"\nIn Ickenroth's favorite image, Suzanne stares at herself in the mirror as her mother brushes her hair. Her glasses are off and there's a streak of light in her face. Just a frame later, the child was back -- the crooked smiles, playful eyes, the tiaras, braids and glitter. But in that instant of calm, Ickenroth thought she saw another side to Suzanne.\n\"It's one of the few moments that I felt like I really saw a 12-year-old there,\" Ickenroth said. \"She seemed like a fierce woman.\"\nSuzanne's parents told Ickenroth that they don't know what Suzanne's future will hold. She's 14 now, and they expect her health problems will grow worse as she gets older. They don't know how she will develop, emotionally or intellectually, or where she'll live out her life.\n\"We just want to cherish this time we have with Suzanne,\" Ickenroth recalls them saying, \"without thinking too much about the future.\"", "Fewer U.S. teens are giving birth, CDC finds": "The study found that just shy of 230,000 girls age 15 to 19 gave birth in 2015, or 22 for every 1,000 teens, which was an 8% decrease from 2014. The birth rate in this age group has been falling sharply since 2007, and between 2013 and 2014, there was a \nrecord decrease\n of 9%.\nEven though the decrease in teen birth rate between 2014 and 2015 does not appear to be quite as large as between 2013 and 2014, it is \"still quite impressive,\" said Brady E. Hamilton, a statistician and demographer at the National Center for Health Statistics who is lead author of the study. \nSince 2007, the year-to-year decline in teen birth rates has been between 7% and 9%, which is \"just astounding compared to change for any other age group,\" Hamilton said. The number of teens becoming moms has dropped by a total of 54% from 2007 to 2015.\nThe number of women giving birth in their 20s has also been declining, albeit more gradually, since 2007. The birth rate among women between 20 and 24 dropped 27% between 2007 and 2015; in the most recent years, the decrease was \n2% from 2013 to 2014\n (PDF) and 3% from 2014 to 2015. Among women 25 and 29, the birth rate has been waning by about 1% each year, with the exception of a small bump of 2% between 2013 and 2014.\nIn contrast, the birth rate among women in their 30s rose about 1% from 2014 to 2015, contributing to an ongoing trend. The number of women between 30 and 34 giving birth has increased 5% since 2011 to 101.4 births per 1,000 women in 2015; the number of moms 35 to 39 climbed 13% since 2010 to 51.7 births per 1,000 women in 2015. \nThere was a relatively big spike of 4% in the birth rate among women 40 to 44 from 2014 to 2015, although the number of births in this age group was still low, at 11 per 1,000 women.  \nThe report adds to the evidence that the age of mothers is rising in the United States, Hamilton said. A \nreport\n by the CDC in January found that the average age when women had their first child increased from 24.9 in 2000 to 26.3 in 2014.\n\"There have been technological changes that make birth control easier and changes in women's economic standing ... which would be consistent with the notion that women want to delay and have better methods of delay,\" said Phillip Levine, professor of economics at Wellesley College. Women are getting more education and contributing to the household income, and \"to take advantage of that, it makes sense to delay childbearing,\" he said.\nThe big improvements in birth control technology are the \nemergency contraception pill\n and \nlong-acting reversible contraceptives\n, known as LARCs, which include intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants. LARCs have \nfailure rates\n (PDF) of less than 1%, whereas condoms and birth control pills result in pregnancy in 18% and 9%, respectively, of cases.\nThe number of women ages 15 to 44 using LARCs has been steadily increasing from 2.4% in 2002 to 8.5% in 2009 to almost 11.6% in 2012, according to a \nreport\n by the Guttmacher Institute.\nThe main factor that probably jump-started the sharp decline in birth rates among teens in 2007 was the Great Recession, Levine said. \"I think teens are capable of responding to environmental conditions in similar ways to adults, and if it is not a good time for adults to have a baby, it is not a good time for a teen to have a baby,\" Levine said.\nThe teen birth rate has continued to drop even now that the recession has ended and the economy is recovering, probably because more teens started using LARCs. \"But its uptake is not huge, and there is certainly room for improvement,\" Levine said. \nAccording to the Guttmacher report, less than 6% of women age 15 to 19 were using a LARC in 2012.\nThe report also found that the number of babies born by cesarean is continuing to decline, from its peak of 32.9% in 2009 to 32% in 2015. Part of the decline could be because ob-gyns are\n less willing\n to perform cesarean deliveries because of the growing understanding that it is riskier for the mother. \nThere was a slight increase in the rate of preterm births, from 9.57% in 2014 to 9.62% in 2015, the first increase since 2007. The number of babies with low birth weight also inched up from 8% in 2014 to 8.07% in 2015 for the first time since 2007.\nThe findings are considered preliminary until all the birth records in the United States in 2015 have been processed, Hamilton said. The final report should be available in October. In previous years, the preliminary reports tended to agree with the final report, Hamilton said.", "Why are humans (mostly) monogamous?": "Although polygamy is practiced in various cultures, humans still tend toward monogamy. But this was not always the norm among our ancestors. Other primates -- the mammalian group, to which humans belong -- are still polygamous, too.\n\"The modern monogamous culture has only been around for just 1,000 years,\" says Kit Opie, an evolutionary anthropologist from University College London.\nOpie describes how the earliest primates -- as early as 75 million years ago -- were solitary and preferred to to live in isolation: \"Adults would only come together to mate.\"\nHow much sex should you be having?\nAs time passed, primates as a whole became more social and evolved to live together in groups, but only humans became truly monogamous. Today, other primate species such as bonobos and chimps mate with multiple individuals in their groups.\n\"Humans shifted in the other direction,\" Opie said.\nWhy did it happen? Current theories suggest it's down to the preservation of an individual's health -- and their offspring.\nSTDs played a role?\nAs group sizes grew among human societies, from tens of people to hundreds of them, so may have the occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases, according to\n a recent study\n.\nChris Bauch and his colleagues at the University of Waterloo in Canada used mathematical models to simulate the evolution of different mating norms in human societies. Using demographic and disease data, they found that when societies become larger, the prevalence of STDs becomes endemic (a regular occurrence) within the population. They suggest that this rise in STDs would have put social pressure on humans to stay monogamous in terms of their mating behavior.\n\"This research shows how events in natural systems, such as the spread of contagious diseases, can strongly influence the development of social norms and, in particular, our group-oriented judgments,\" Bauch, a professor of applied mathematics at Waterloo, said \nin a statement\n.\nThe team suggests that in smaller societies, of 30 people or so -- typical of earlier hunter-gatherer populations -- STD outbreaks would have been short-lived and have had no significant impact on a population. However, as societies evolved and agriculture developed to make them even larger, rates of STDs would have been large enough that infertility from infections such as syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea would have been high, according to the research. Treatments for these conditions were not then available. \nThey suggest that monogamy would have therefore given males an advantage when producing offspring. The team also stresses that the STDs would have been a form of punishment for those who were polygamous.\nHow do astronauts handle their periods in space?\nOpie is not convinced of this theory, however, and believes that the larger societies stemming from the onset of agriculture and farming resulted in monogamy because people wanted to preserve their wealth through marriage. \n\"It's an interesting approach. ... You can imagine this maybe happening in larger societies,\" Opie said. \"But it's marriage that matters here, as [this] is what passes on inheritance. ... Monogamy is a marriage system, not a mating system.\"\nBauch and his team noted that other factors would be involved, such as female choice. His team suggests that infections simply helped influence what is now a social norm. \"Our social norms did not develop in complete isolation from what was happening in our natural environment.\"\nOr is it all about fatherhood?\nOpie does agree that larger group sizes -- and societies -- had a role to play in us becoming monogamous, but with a darker rationale: infanticide.\nThe team at UCL suggests that as primates developed and became more social, their brain size grew to accommodate this increased complexity over time. This in turn meant the brains of infants were larger than previous generations and required more attention -- and lactation -- from their mothers, resulting in females being less readily available to mate again after giving birth. \n\"Males [in the group] are basically sitting around waiting to mate with the female,\" Opie said. \"It would therefore pay for the man to kill the infant, so he can mate with the female.\"\nAs the fathers would want their offspring to survive, they would nurture -- and protect -- them as necessary by pairing up.\nIn 2013, Opie published a paper arguing that monogamy came about so males could protect their infants. \"One way to deal with this [risk of infanticide] is for the male and female to become a pair,\" he said.\nBoth theories remain exactly that -- theories -- without the options of a time machine and translator to go back to early human species and explore what happened to make us love the way we do today. But Opie also believes we're now slowly retreating away from this idea of staying with one partner. \n10 tips for a good night's sleep\n\"We're moving away from 'Until death do us part' as women are no longer willing to put up with [polygamy],\" he said.\nThe future of that theory is ours to decide.", "Bryan Stow, attacked for being a baseball fan, finds his new calling": "Rising up, back on the street\nDid my time, took my chances\nWent the distance, now I'm back on my feet\nJust a man and his will to survive\nThe lyrics sum up Stow's remarkable progress since the former paramedic was attacked five years ago by two men in the parking lot of Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium. The story made headlines around the country for its shocking brutality. \nStow, an avid San Francisco Giants fan, had driven from Northern California with two friends to see his team take on the Dodgers on Major League Baseball's opening day in 2011.   \nAs the game ended, Stow and his friends were on the hunt for a taxi back to their hotel. Wearing their orange and black Giants garb, the group was heckled while making their way to the cab line.  \nStow says he doesn't remember anything from the game, but his friends say they were blindsided by the attack. Stow's only major sin that night: \nwearing a Giants jersey in a sea of Dodgers fans\n. \n\"I heard the crack,\" Stow's friend Corey Maciel testified at trial, recalling Stow's head hitting the pavement with a sickening sound.\nStow was unable to break his fall, and his skull was severely fractured.  His attackers then repeatedly kicked him in the head and ribs as he lay on the ground.\nThe man who found a calling jumping out of ambulances to save people's lives was suddenly the victim.  And the prognosis was grim: brain damage.  \nFor the next nine months, the 42-year-old father of two clung to life in a coma. The only things that kept him alive were the machines pumping air into his lungs and the feeding tubes providing nutrition to keep his body functioning.\nBut Stow is not in the Lincoln High auditorium today to relive the horror.  He has come to try once more to save lives, albeit through another method. As unlikely as it seems, Stow has found his voice as a powerful speaker. His message:  The thugs who attacked him in that parking lot were basically the same as schoolyard bullies. Older, stronger, more dangerous, yes, but bullies, nonetheless.\n\"Stand up to the bully,\" he urges the students. \"Tell them you don't think it's cool.\"\nHow Stow got to a place where he could muster both the physical strength and mental confidence to speak in public is a testament to modern medicine, the love and support from his family, and his personal will.\nA milestone walk along the beach\nOn a recent spring day, Stow is on his way home after setting foot on the beach for the first time since his injury.\nWith the aid of crutches outfitted with special pads, Stow was able to gingerly walk a couple hundred feet on the warm sand. The 20-minute effort has left him tired, but the milestone has him in good spirits as he gets into the front seat of his father's minivan.\n\"I used to be put in the back like groceries, but now I'm in the front seat. I'm calling the shots,\" Stow often says when he speaks to students. \nIt's the small victories that Stow seems to relish now, and hearing him recall those early days of recovery, you understand why.\n\"I went from being in bed in the hospital to being placed in a wheelchair and then back to bed.   That was the event of my day.\"\n24\u00bd pills a day\nDivorced before the attack, the now 47-year-old Stow lives with his parents in his childhood home in Capitola, California, a small enclave near Santa Cruz.  \nHis mornings begin with eight pills, which he takes before he even gets out of bed. The medicine helps prevent seizures and blood clots. At noon, 4\u00bd more pills follow. At night, another 12. That's 24\u00bd  pills a day.  Missing just one dose could land him back in the hospital.\nHis parents are his primary caregivers. Professionals help for a couple of hours in the mornings and evenings, assisting Stow with the daily tasks able-bodied people take for granted: showering, using the bathroom, getting dressed.  \n\"After waking up, I had to learn \nhow to live again\n,\" Stow says. \"I had to learn how to walk again.\"\nA remarkable recovery, but challenges remain\nHow far he's come is not lost on those who are closest to him. \n\"What's more remarkable is he's going to improve,\" says Dr. Robert Quinn, who has been working with Stow for two years in his rehabilitation.\nHe attributes some of that improvement to a pair of surgeries \"to remove bone growth on Stow's hips and left elbow.\" \nPatients with severe brain and spinal cord injuries are known to have spontaneous bone growth, a condition called heterotopic ossification. In clinical terms, it's the presence of bone in soft tissue where bone doesn't normally exist. \nThe surgeries have helped with mobility, but Stow still faces challenges using his left arm, able to raise it only about as high as his nose and to bring it only about 6 inches to his face.  \n\"That's pretty sad,\" Stow says.\nThe wisecracking patient\nFor those who knew him before the attack, the big question in his recovery has always been about the severity of his brain injury. \nIt's difficult to quantify; brain injuries are unique and the healing process is also varied.  \nBut anyone who spends time with Stow will soon realize it's easy to carry on conversations with him.  He listens and responds to questions.  He speaks in complete sentences and has a wide vocabulary.  \nAnd his humor comes easily and naturally.     \nWhen asked if he's always been a Giants fan, the man whose bedroom resembles a mini museum to his beloved team responds: \"Uh, yeah, hello.\"    \nFor his sister, Bonnie Bush, her older brother is \"similar, but different.\" \n\"He's more caring and more loving than he used to be.  We can't walk out of the room without him saying, 'I love you,' and he needs a hug before we leave,\" she says.\nQuinn says that while Stow hasn't had a normal neuropsychological examination for a long time, \"his ability to incorporate different kinds of input has dramatically improved.  He's really got a sense of humor.  That means he's aware of himself and the context of his situation and other people around him.  He's learning and developing new ideas.  He's got an adult intellect. And he's really challenging himself to grow, which is probably the most important thing.\"\nFinding his new calling\nEveryone in Stow's life readily acknowledges it is the anti-bullying speaking engagements that seem to be having the most positive impact in his life. In essence, they are allowing him to work again, improving his self-esteem and giving him a reason to get out of bed.  \nThe person who deserves the most credit is Brandy Dickinson, Stow's speech language pathologist, who has been working with him since 2013.  \nEarly in Stow's recovery, she took him to a preschool so he could work on some basic communication skills.  \n\"It's really fun to get adults and children together when someone needs to work on speaking, memory and processing,\"   she says.  \"There were five or six kids.  It was really safe.  It was a good start.\" \nAfter a few visits, Stow and Dickinson knew the kids were likely to ask what happened to him.  \n\"We didn't know what was appropriate to say to the children, so we just came up with 'I got hurt by adult bullies,' and it just made so much sense. Like 'Wow, Bryan, you're changing lives here.'\" \nEventually Stow and Dickinson came up with a slide show that shows pictures and videos of Stow in all his physical stages -- before the attack and after.  \nIt comes just before Stow pivots in his presentation to the message he really wants to resonate with the students: Bullies destroyed my life and if left unchecked they could destroy you or your loved ones as well.\nTo drive home the message, they show pictures of teenagers who killed themselves after being bullied.  It is raw and powerful, and sometimes students burst into tears while sharing with Stow their own personal experiences with bullying. \nSo far, he's been to about 30 schools in California, ranging from elementary to high school, and he's booked for the rest of the school year, averaging two new visits per week.  \nA foundation in his name has been set up so he can expand his travels and pay for the costs.  This fall he will cross the Pacific Ocean to speak to students in Hawaii.\nWhen his presentation at Lincoln High School is over, the kids rush the stage to take pictures with him.\n\"I was treated like a rock star,\" he says. \"As dumb as that sounds, it felt really cool.\"\n'Filthy, dirty people'\nStill, Stow has his low points. \nIn his private moments he is saddened by the things he can't do.\n\"I want to go dancing with a nice woman.  I really want to do that,\" he says. \"Bowling.  I can't do that anymore.\"\nOf his attackers, \nLouie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood\n, he calls them \"filthy, dirty people.\"\nBoth accepted plea deals for the attack.\n\"One got eight years, the other got four years. Baloney.\"\nIt's the rare time Stow shows a flash of anger.  \n'I want to live again'\nFinancially, it's estimated that Stow's lifetime medical care costs could total $30 million.   \nAlleging that lax security played a significant role in the attack, Stow sued the Dodgers organization and \nwas awarded $18 million\n.\nBut he'll get only a fraction of it.\nJurors concluded that Sanchez and Norwood should be responsible for $4 million, though it's not expected Stow will get a dime from them.  And after the attorneys and insurers get paid, he will receive less than $6 million, which will be paid out over several years.\n \"We try to be very frugal,\" says his mother, Ann, a retired church secretary.   \nTo keep costs down, she and her husband ultimately decided against hiring a full-time caregiver.  They have learned how to take care of Stow themselves. \nWith his improvement, fortunately, it's getting a bit easier.\nOne of Stow's primary goals is to live a more independent lifestyle, which his rehabilitation doctor believes is realistic. Stow could eventually live on his own, as long as he has people around to help run errands and provide transportation.\n\"I don't just want to sit back and survive,\" Stow says. \"I want to live.\" \nBy all accounts he is doing just that.\nTo contribute to the Bryan Stow Foundation, visit \nhttp://bryanstowfoundation.org", "The centenarian tide is on the rise": "Using data from the United States Census Bureau and death certificates filed in the United States, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined the death rate and causes of death in this oldest-of-the-old population between 2000 and 2014.\nThe study reported that, although Americans in their very golden years are still rare, the population has grown by 44% in recent years, from 50,281 in 2000 to 72,197 in 2014. \nThe study found that, after increasing 10% between 2000 and 2008, the death rate for female centenarians dropped 14% between 2008 and 2014 to 36.5 deaths for every 100 women. The death rate among males in this age group dropped by 20% from 2008 to 2014, after increasing 41% between 2000 and 2008, and was 33.2 per 100 in 2014.\n\"It looks like the population 100 and older is living longer now so the [death] rate has decreased, but I don't know exactly what caused that,\" said Dr. Jiaquan Xu, an epidemiologist at the CDC National Center for Health Statistics and author of \nthe study,\n which was released in January.\nIt is also not clear what the death rate of centenarians looked like before the 21st century, and whether the recent decline is a new trend or a continuation of a past trend. The study did not include earlier years before 2000 because the age reported on death certificates was less reliable, Xu said.\nThere are many reasons that good data were hard to come by for centenarians back then, and it has not necessarily gotten  much better since 2000, said Dr. Thomas Perls, geriatrician and director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston Medical Center. For one, it has been hard for the Census Bureau to get a good handle on how many centenarians there are in the United States, Perls said. And when an elderly family member passes away, their relatives might overestimate their age on the death certificate. \"It's a story that grew and grew, like the fish (you caught) that got bigger and bigger,\" Perls said.  \nBecause of these reasons, it is hard to know if the death rate among Americans 100 and up has truly been on the decline since 2008. It is probably some part fact and some part artifact, Perls said. \n\"It could decline as we have better medical care, as people take on healthy habits and exercise more and don't smoke ... but I don't know if it will decrease by 20%,\" as was seen among male centenarians between 2008 and 2014, Perls said \nWhat do centenarians die of?\nAlthough Xu is not sure what could account for the declining death rate he found among centenarians, he does think at least part of it could be because fewer are dying of common killers, such as heart disease and stroke. \nThe study found that, between 2000 and 2014, the rates of death due to heart disease, stroke and flu and pneumonia, which were the top three causes of death for female and male centenarians in 2000, dropped by 24%, 31% and 48%, respectively. \n\"If you diagnose chronic diseases (such as heart disease) earlier and get proper treatment, those can be controlled or even prevented. Then people with those kinds of diseases could live longer,\" Xu said. As for the lower rates of flu and pneumonia, they are probably due to more vaccinations, as well as older people just being healthier in general and better able to recover from the flu, he added.  \nOver this period, other less common causes of death crept up. The death rates due to Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure (and related problems such as kidney disease) and respiratory diseases grew by 119%, 88% and 34%, respectively, between 2000 and 2014. Alzheimer's shot up from the fifth to the second leading cause of death among female centenarians from 2000 to 2014; among men, it was not on the top five in 2000 to number five in 2014. \nHowever, Perls doubts there has really been an increase in the number of centenarians who have and are dying from Alzheimer's. \"Doctors are much better now about accurately indicating whether a person (in their 100s) has Alzheimer's. Either they didn't recognize it before or thought, 'What do you expect for your age?' So I think it's just reported much more,\" he said.\nA 'hardy' bunch\nAlthough it might sound like good news that centenarians seem to have joined nearly every other age group (\nother than middle-aged white Americans\n) in living longer, it is too soon to celebrate. \"Once people get to be so old, the majority, I think, need help for their daily life. So I'm not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing. It is a quality of life issue,\" Xu said.\nBut there is at least some reason to be optimistic. \"What we have found ... is that even with pretty significant physical limitations and impairments, their subjective well being and amount they value life is surprisingly high,\" said Kathrin Boerner, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Massachusetts Boston.\nNevertheless, the explosion in the very aging population, those 95 years and older, and the chronic diseases that most of them have is already creating an \"intense burden for the health care system,\" Boerner said, adding that it is \"totally not ready for it.\"\nThere are many questions around how to care for the oldest of the old, and it probably doesn't just come down to building more nursing homes, Boerner said. Many of them want to stay in their own homes, and research suggests they are doing that. \"In our studies, 60% of those 95 years and above are living in the community. They are not necessarily healthy but they are a hardy people,\" Boerner said.\nFollow CNN Health on \nFacebook\n and \nTwitter\n.", "Portland schools use bottled water after lead scare": "The city's schools are providing their 49,000 students with bottled water after tests in March showed unsafe levels of lead in the drinking water in some schools.\nThe school district announced Friday it was shutting down drinking fountains while it conducts testing at all 78 schools this summer. Lead levels at two schools were found to have exceeded the maximum contaminant standards issued by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\nSchool cooks will use bottled water for all food preparation and the cafeterias will use disposable plates and utensils for the remainder of the school year, the school district said. The school year ends June 9.\n\"The health and safety of our students and staff is paramount. I appreciate the quick response over the weekend to implement an immediate fix,\" says Portland Public Schools Board Chair Tom Koehler. \"It's clear we have more work to do to review our testing protocols. The board will work with the superintendent to make sure this happens expeditiously.\"\nThe public, however, has been voicing concerns that school authorities took too long -- more than two months -- to notify parents that there were issues with the water at at least two schools. Authorities tested the water at Creston and Rose City Park elementary schools on March 22 after parents requested it. Water in 14 fixtures out of 92 exceeded the EPA maximum contaminant level for lead under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the district said.\nBut the schools only notified parents at Rose City Park and Creston last week about the elevated lead levels. \nFollowing a special school board meeting Tuesday, parent Mike Southern told board members and school officials that kids had been put at risk because of a \"failure of leadership.\" \nThe Oregonian newspaper reported\n that Southern took special aim at Carole Smith, superintendent of the city's schools.\n\"School board, you need to act,\" Southern said, to applause from the crowd. \"Carole Smith, you need to go.\"\nMore concerns have surfaced since \nthe Oregonian reported prior testing found elevated lead levels at 51 public schools\n since 2009. The highest lead readings were 16 times the federal level, the Oregonian reported. District officials have not said why they conducted the tests or what steps were taken to ensure safe water, the Oregonian reported.\nSmith promised the district would do better at keeping the public informed.\n\"In addition to providing safe drinking water to all of our students, we will be taking immediate action to examine the protocols and procedures that resulted in delayed notification of our families and delays in shutting off impacted water sources,\"  she said. \"We are taking all of these steps out of an abundance of caution for our students, our teachers, and our staff, as we work to determine whether additional schools have elevated levels of lead in the drinking water.\"\nStarting next week, public schools will work with Multnomah County to test Creston and Rose City Park students for levels of lead in their blood, the district said.\nThe district said it has replaced two fountains and sinks in two rooms at Rose City Park and both now meet the safe-water standard. Sinks with high lead levels in two science classrooms at Rose City Park are now posted with signs instructing students not to drink the water because the source of lead is the piping and replacing it would be too costly, the district said. The district said it is also working at replacing sinks and fountains at Creston.\nThe EPA  typically recommends a lead level below 20 parts per billion for schools. Portland Public Schools said they have set a more stringent requirement of 15 parts per billion.", "Tears and smiles: Angela's beautiful life": "Klein had been recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a severe mental illness characterized by emotional instability and periods of depression and anxiety that are uncontrollable and overwhelming. But she has struggled her entire life. She had a traumatic childhood and started harming herself at an early age. In addition to cutting herself, she said, she has also experienced an eating disorder and harmful thoughts and emotions that lowered her self-esteem. \nBefore meeting Busch, Klein had experienced a pivotal breakdown where she felt like she was losing control. She was working through the therapy process when they met. \nThe diagnosis brought some relief for Klein because she was able to seek help through a private treatment facility, but she would also have to work through her illness -- both on her own and with the help of her husband, Jeff, and their four children. What followed was \"Angela's Beautiful Life,\" a year of Busch documenting the family's triumphs and struggles, from smiles to tears. \n\"To let me take photos of someone and their family takes so much courage,\" Busch said. \"Angela wants to help other people with her story of how to keep going and moving through it.\"\nSome of the toughest moments for Klein and her husband occur when she has a dissociative episode -- flashbacks where she relives childhood trauma and becomes disconnected to everything around her. Although this often happens in her sleep, little things can trigger one when she's awake as well. \nKlein told Busch that these episodes feel like being in a car that's crashed into a lake. She can feel the water rising up with no escape. Her emotions overtake her, and she has to try to breathe through it, like breathing underwater. \n\"It's a scary moment to be in, for both her and her husband,\" Busch said. They attend weekly couples therapy together, but both also have private sessions as well. It has helped Jeff to know how he can help and try to bring her out of the episodes where she doesn't recognize him. \nWhile borderline personality disorder is still a daily struggle for Klein, her emotional range also helps her empathize and connect with others. During a drive with Busch in the car, Klein was moved to tears after hearing an emotional story on the radio about human trafficking. \n\"Angela doesn't let go of her empathy when she hears about the struggles of others; she connects to it and to them,\" Busch said. \"Her emotional range can go from self-destructive to engaging and compassionate.\" \nKlein now volunteers at an organization that works with those who have been victims of human trafficking. \nFor Busch, telling the story of the Klein family required him to be a constant, quiet presence, releasing the shutter when he witnessed moments that were important or captured the emotion that was in the room. He also witnessed the balancing act of protecting the Klein children from extremes while also keeping them aware of what was going on. \nWhen Klein went to a treatment center for two months, she wasn't able to say goodbye to her kids beforehand. They told Elise, who was 6 years old at the time, that she had gone to \"Mommy School.\" It has caused Elise to fear that she'll come home from school one day to find that Mom is gone again. Klein and her husband have always been very close with their children and continue that focus. \nWhat surprised Busch was the normalcy he found in their everyday life: waking up, praying together, going to school and work and actively engaging in the community.\nThe photos were shared in an exhibit at the local elementary school, and Klein attended. She wanted to share her story with a wider audience by opening herself up to her community, and it's been a supportive experience. \nBusch wants to continue documenting and sharing stories on mental illness, both to help combat the stigma surrounding them as well as raise awareness for those who don't have access to facilities and treatment centers. \nEven though the project has come to a close, Busch and Klein still keep in touch. Klein is in outpatient therapy and doing much better. She has been free of self-harm since Thanksgiving, which is the longest period of time since her tumultuous year of 2014. She works through living with her disorder each day, using different skills from therapy. Rather than being impulsive, she has empowered herself by recognizing the signs and confronting them. \n\"I think she has gotten a lot better over the last two years,\" Busch said.", "Does this doctor hold the secret to ending malaria?": "As director of the\n Jenner institute\n, Hill is creating a well-crafted \"potion\" of ingredients which, when combined inside a vaccine, could prepare our immune system to attack biological invaders. \nHis formulation could one day form the foundation to protect humans from a range of diseases including malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. It's being harnessed to design a new class of vaccine, unlike any other in use today, with an end goal of disease elimination.\n\"This is being assessed widely for use in cancer, Hepatitis C, and we've used it in Ebola and HIV,\" says Hill. \"There are 8 different diseases where [this] approach is in clinical trial.\" \nNot all of these trials are being led by Hill, but he has pioneered the protocol for testing these vaccines in humans -- not just mice or monkeys like many before him. He trialled \nEbola vaccines \nduring the 2014 epidemic and his institute has \none in development for Zika\n.\nHowever, his desire to create vaccines began with a wish to stop one particular disease -- malaria.\nAs a young medical student, aged 20, Hill had visited his uncle in what was then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and was shocked by the health issues there. \n\"Not only was there a huge amount of disease and very little medical care, but also a war,\" says Hill. As he traveled around the African continent for research in subsequent years, he saw the true extent of the malaria epidemic.\n\"I was really overwhelmed by the scale of the problem,\" says Hill. \"It became clear to me that what the world needed was a vaccine against malaria.\"\nHill's desire to eliminate malaria is an ambitious goal. The parasite behind the disease -- Plasmodium falciparum -- infected\n 214 million people \nin 2015, and caused more than 430,000 deaths.\n\"[If we] compare this with Ebola ... the same year we had almost 500,000 malaria deaths ... if malaria was new and suddenly killing half a million people on the continent and hadn't been doing that before there would be a global panic,\" says Hill.\nThe numbers affected have fallen over the last decade, coming down from more than 1 million deaths each year, thanks mostly to the effective use of insecticide-treated bed nets, insecticide spraying in homes, and the development of combination drug therapies. But resistance has now emerged, most notably in South-East Asia, against both the drugs and insecticides, and is likely to spread. \nA more sustainable solution is needed -- such as a vaccine -- and Hill is determined to make it happen.\nDuring more than 20 years working on vaccines, he has tested tens of vaccines in humans, 55 of them just on malaria, to eventually find out they are not effective.\nWhile for some this would be demoralizing, for Hill each is just another hurdle on the way to the finish line.\nHow his vaccine would work\nThe immune response of a human is an extremely complex beast that experts are still yet to fully understand. Vaccines, however, generally work by making the body believe it is infected and gearing up the adaptive immune system to fight this supposed infection using antibodies -- having them primed and ready for future infections.\nCurrent vaccines, such as those used against measles, tetanus or polio, work in this way, generating antibodies that flag future infections for other immune cells to attack. But this effect isn't quite enough to fight more complicated diseases, such as malaria. \nThe plasmodium parasite has many routes of attack, a complicated life cycle with multiple stages of development, and thousands more genes than other disease-causing bugs.\n\"With malaria you've got 5,000 genes, so you've got to figure out the best [ones] to put in the vaccine,\" says Hill. The genes create proteins once inside the body to kick start immunity against the parasite.\n\"If you just look historically when people have tried to protect against malaria with just antibodies, it has not worked,\" says \nHelen Fletcher\n, a former colleague of Hill at Oxford who is now senior lecturer in Immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \nSo Hill is going for a whole new approach. \n\"Our vaccine works in a fundamentally different way,\" he says. \"We're targeting the cellular arm of the immune system.\"\nThis \"arm\" is the home of a different group of cells, known as T-cells. His team are specifically targeting CD8 T-cells, known as killer cells, which have the ability to kill any cells that are infected, as well as cancer cells. The challenge is getting enough of them.\n\"The problem is we need probably of the order of 2,000 to get good efficacy,\" he says. That led to the development of his latest formula -- a combination of two viruses that have been given the DNA of the malaria parasite. The virus-containing vaccines are injected into people on two separate occasions, to first prime the body, then boost the immune response.\nThe strategy is aptly called the prime-boost approach.\nHow to prime\nAfter years of trialling different combinations of viruses, Hill's team believe they have a winning formula. \n \"I remember where I was standing when I first saw the result of prime-boost, not in humans but in mice; suddenly from getting no protection we were getting every mouse protected,\" says Hill. \nThey had seen 100% protection against malaria in mice, after previous attempts showing just 20%.\n\"That was a very memorable moment, in 1996, as then I knew we were onto something,\" he says. \nThey soon decided on a\n particular pairing of viruses \nwhich each have DNA from the malaria parasite inserted. Immunization begins with an injection of a modified adenovirus that typically infects chimps (CHA) and a later injection of a modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus acting as a booster.\n\"That is a non-obvious thing to do -- nearly every vaccine you get is given as the same composition once, twice or three times,\" says Hill.\nThey were soon seeing thousands of T-cells being generated, primed to attack infected cells.\nFrom mice to people\nHill's vaccine was recently trialled in humans, among 121 adults in Kenya, and \nwas 67% effective \nin preventing malaria for eight weeks following the injection.\n\"That is probably one of the best results ever in the malaria vaccine field,\" says Hill. \nBut his target age group is infants. \n\"We always wanted to vaccinate the younger infants because you don't get malaria until you're about 6 months of age, so [we want to get] the vaccines in before that,\" says Hill. \nField trials in infants are at least one year away, but Hill is determined to make it happen.\n\"I think the prime boost approach is the best strategy that we have [against] these difficult pathogens,\" says Fletcher, whose own research focuses on vaccines for tuberculosis.\nHill hopes his current vaccine will enter the final stage clinical trials by 2022, in order to have a vaccine licensed for use by 2025.\nBut he has even greater ambitions for his future vaccines. \nFour in one\nWhile Hill's current vaccine design targets malaria at one of its earliest stages, when it enters the liver, this is just one of multiple stages through which the malaria parasite causes its damage. Four of these stages are prime targets for an immune attack and Hill wants to take on each of them -- using one extra potent vaccine.\n\"If you got partially effective vaccines with efficacy that's 30 % maybe 60% on an ideal setting, why wouldn't you use all the components to maximize efficacy?\" says Hill.\nHis team at the Jenner Institute have a range of vaccines in development that target each of these four stages. If results are good in future trials, they hope to one day combine them all together.\nThe most success in developing a vaccine against malaria has, to date, been by pharmaceutical giant GSK. In 2015, their RTS,S vaccine, trade name Mosquirix, was shown to \npartially protect infants\n and young children from developing malaria. But it wasn't quite enough for the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend its use in infants, and in January 2016 the organization called for pilot programs to test its effectiveness among young children in a real-world setting. While this happens, Hill is hoping to improve his vaccine and trial it in infants so it is ultimately a more effective option.\n\"Malaria is [his] original passion and original research interest, but what a target...it's such a difficult pathogen to work with,\" says Fletcher. \"But maybe that's what keeps him interested.\"\nCould Hill hold the future solution to truly ending malaria?\n\"We'll let you know in 2025,\" he says. \"It's looking as if it may be doable, [so] we think this is going to work.\"", "What you should know about this 'new' STD": "Though experts have known of MG's existence since the '80s, the new paper published in the International Journal of Epidemiology reveals that the bacterial infection, which resides in the urinary and genital tracts, likely spreads through sexual contact.\nTo reach their findings, researchers at University College London, examined urine samples of 4,507 men and women between 18 and 44 years old who were sexually active with at least one partner. Of these participants, 48 women and 24 men were diagnosed with MG. However, when the researchers tested urine samples from about 200 teenagers who had never had sex, zero tested positive for the infection.\nRELATED: The Top 10 Myths About Safe Sex and Sexual Health\nWe spoke with Raquel Dardik, MD, a clinical associate professor at NYU Langone's Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health, to get the facts on the \"new\" STD.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nJust like many other STDs, MG is often asymptomatic, Dr. Dardik says. In fact, the University College London study found that 94.4% of men and 56.2% of women with MG didn't report any symptoms.\nHowever there are some tip-offs. For women, this includes irritation, painful urination, and bleeding after sex, Dr. Dardik explains. For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis.\nRELATED: 20 Weird Facts About Sex and Love\nMG has been linked to both inflammation in the cervix (cervicitis) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a serious condition often caused by other STDs like chlamydia and gonorrhea. Dr. Dardik says that about 10% of women who develop PID (which causes abdominal pain, fever, painful cervix, and pain or bleeding during sex) can blame MG as the underlying cause.\nCan I get tested?\nYes, you can definitely ask your doctor to test you, especially if the symptoms sound familiar. But part of the reason experts are just now finding out MG is sexually transmitted is that it's not quite as easy as getting tested for say, chlamydia or another STD, Dr. Dardik explains.\nWhy? Far fewer labs offer the test, which means your doctor will have to send it to the nearest research center or big university lab that offers it, which can delay your results significantly depending on where you live.\nThe good news: Dr. Dardik is confident that in light of the new findings, more labs will jump at the opportunity to add these tests to their repertoire.\nRELATED: Everything You Know About Herpes is Wrong\nIn the meantime, she stresses: \"If you have [symptoms of an] infection, but all the tests come back negative, it's important to consider that MG may be the cause.\"\nIs it treatable?\nThankfully, yes. The antibiotic azithromycin (the same \"Z-pack\" you take when you get strep throat) is effective against MG, Dr. Dardik says.\nHow can I prevent it?\n\"Condoms, condoms, condoms,\" Dr. Dardik says. \"The bottom line is it's a bacteria, and condoms are very effective against bacteria.\"\nThis article originally appeared on \nHealth.com\n. ", "From the darkness of disaster, a ray of hope in Nepal": "At 4 feet 10 inches, she towers over classmates barely out of toddler stage. At lunch, she is the only one who doesn't need a bib. And all the other children call her Maya didi, using the Nepali term of respect for an older sister. \nMaya will be 11 soon and only recently made it to kindergarten. Still, it is a triumph she has come this far.\nMaya is not from this bustling city, which lures mountaineers aiming for Everest and tourists mesmerized by the Himalayan kingdom's rich history and culture. She comes from a remote and rugged place not frequented by outsiders. \nShe is one of six children in a family that lives off the land and livestock in Kashi Gaon, a village in Nepal's mountainous Gorkha District. Maya helped her mother with cooking, cleaning and fetching firewood and water. She was destined to be married at a tender age and grow old within the confines of her birthplace.\nShe knew little of the world outside. Life's possibilities escaped her. \nBut a year ago, on April 25, the earth shook violently for a minute, and in those 60 devastating seconds, Maya's life was forever changed.\nHer left leg was crushed and could not be saved. \nSeveral days later, a second quake rattled Nepal, bringing down more buildings, ending more lives. On that day, Maya's trajectory changed again, but in a way no one could have predicted. \nThe second quake gave her a rare second chance at life in a nation ravaged by nature's cruelty.\nNearly 9,000 people died in Nepal in the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and the 7.3 aftershock; millions of lives were shattered. Recovery has been so slow that some people here say their country will never be the same. Centuries-old buildings and temples lie cracked or in ruins, like festering national wounds. In many areas, the rubble remains. Thousands live under makeshift shelters fashioned from\n \nplastic, bamboo and corrugated tin. Maya might have been one of them.\nI first met her just days after the first quake \nin the Kathmandu hospital where her leg was amputated. She was confined to a bed; thick bandages covered her fresh wound. I visited her several times and when I left, I carried with me an image of a frightened little girl, traumatized and howling in pain.\nA year later, I returned to the Nepalese capital to learn if anything good had blossomed from the horror.\n \nA new beginning\nI arrive at a large house on the outskirts of the city, eager to speak with Maya. \nMy first glimpse of her on this trip is vastly different. She is sitting on a sunny porch, amid pots of pink geraniums and pinwheel petunias. The garden is lush with flowers and organically grown vegetables. \nShe has been on holiday during the Nepali new year break and has just returned from a short trip home to see her family in Kashi Gaon. The next day, she will return to Angel's Garden, the kindergarten she has been attending for almost a year.\nShe gets up from her chair, and I can see she looks healthier. She has traded the cement-like millet porridge that filled her belly in the village for finer fare like rice and chicken curry.\nExcept for her limp, it's hard to tell she is missing part of her left leg, her prosthetic concealed on this day by yellow pants and dark socks. There are few hints of the tragedy that befell her.\nShe plays with Luna, the dog that belongs to the owners of this house, a family that has embraced her as their own. She speaks very little, but I attribute that to timidity. She is a quiet, reserved girl.\nIn this part of Kathmandu, in this house, there are no telltale signs of the events a year ago that splintered thousands of lives -- except in the kitchen. There, a white board is filled with family scribbles and these words:\n\"Great Earthquake of 2015. April 25. May 12.\"\nA bleak future\nApril 25 last year fell on a Saturday, and that morning Maya had no school. She woke up and walked up the hill to carry back drinking water for her family, like she did every morning. There was no indoor plumbing or potable water at the family's home. \nThe dirt paths in Kashi Gaon are steep, uneven and laden with rocks, pebbles and boulders. Maya has grown adept at navigating them. Everyone gets accustomed to walking long distances in Gorkha; it's a way of life in Nepal's mountainous districts, the only way to get around.\nMaya's father, Bhim Bahadur Gurung, is an uneducated man who worked the fields growing barley and maize or tending goats and cattle. The prize of his hardscrabble life: his house and wife and children.\nMaya's baby sister was only 3 months old and her mother, Mukni, depended on her elder daughter as a vital extra set of hands. Though Maya walked 50 minutes to school on weekdays and had made it to the fourth grade, education was not the family priority. Almost 40% of the women in Gorkha District are illiterate. \nThat Saturday morning, Maya finished her chores and set off with her uncle Dami and his 5-year-old daughter, Manisha, to graze cows. They made their way to lower ground and drifted far from Maya's home. \nAt 11:56 a.m., the earth rumbled under Maya's feet. Her entire world was moving and it felt as though the Himalayas would swallow everyone whole. A storm of boulders, rocks, parts of houses and other debris came hurtling down the mountainside.\nDami gathered the two girls and began running for shelter. He tried to dodge the rocks but could not. A boulder crushed Maya's left foot and lower leg. \nShe screamed in pain as her uncle, also injured, carried Maya and his own badly bruised daughter, trying to get back to their village.\nMaya's parents did not know where she was. Her father returned from the fields to an apocalyptic sight. Almost every house in Kashi Gaon, including his family's, lay flattened or badly damaged. Gorkha was one of two districts that were hardest hit.\nBhim Bahadur searched frantically until he finally found his daughter, wrapped her leg in rags and tried to find help. The few medical facilities in Kashi Gaon that are equipped to treat earthquake injuries were reduced to rubble. \nIt took time for rescue helicopters to navigate Gorkha District's hilly terrain. Maya's mangled leg remained untreated. Finally, on Sunday, Bhim Bahadur hopped aboard a Nepalese army chopper with Maya. But when it stopped to pick up more of the injured, he was ordered off. He watched the helicopter lift to the sky, carrying his daughter away, thankful for the aid she would get but anxious that she would face her darkest moments alone.\nHe hitchhiked, boarded buses and walked to Kathmandu. He searched hospital after hospital until he finally found Maya four days later. She was at Tribhuban University Teaching Hospital, where many earthquake victims were receiving free or low-cost care.\nHot tears streamed down her dust-caked cheeks. A green woolen blanket covered her from the waist down on bed number 41. She grabbed her father tight. \nBhim Bahadur's relief was short-lived. He soon saw the bandage on Maya's leg, with a date scribbled on it. Doctors told him they were forced to amputate from the shin down, that it would have been much worse had they taken her leg above the knee.\nIt didn't matter. He knew instantly what the future held for his daughter.\nNepal's steep and rocky land would show her no mercy. She would no longer be able to help out at home and would have to be carried everywhere. And when she grew older, who would take care of her? No man would want her as a bride. \nLife in Nepal is filled with uncertainties for poor people like Maya. The earthquake made lives even more ominous.\n \nThe Good Samaritan\nJwalant Gurung shares a last name with Maya, common to Nepalis who belong to the Gurung ethnic group. But he might as well be a foreigner. His life is that different from hers. \nJwalant, 40, grew up in Kathmandu, the son of a former soldier in the British Army's famed Gurkha Regiment and a pioneer in Nepal's trekking industry. His father, Dinesh Gurung, worked in the nation's first trekking company and then launched his own, Crystal Mountain Treks, in 1990. \nJwalant earned an MBA from the University of Washington and worked a few jobs before he returned to his true love: the mountains. He took over his father's business after he retired and now competes with about 1,700 other travel agencies that help guide the thousands of foreigners who flock to Nepal each year to hike and climb in the Himalayas.\nJwalant, the city slicker, is as adept at traversing the terrain of Gorkha District as the villagers. But he is more than a mountaineer.\nFor his MBA project, he organized a fundraising climb of Washington's Mount Rainier to further rural education in places like Kashi Gaon. Since then, his charity, 3 Summits for Nepal, has built six schools and is in the process of finishing two more. \nHe believes in the power of education. He's seen it in his own home, where his parents, over the years, have taken in children from disenfranchised families and given them a chance to improve their lots in life.\nA year ago, on April 25, Jwalant was on a scouting trek on the Kopra Ridge, a route in the shadows of the snow-capped Annapurna range. When the Earth began convulsing, Jwalant ran for his life and made it back safely to Kathmandu, where he began helping earthquake victims. Singla, a village near the epicenter, was home to one of his guides and several of his porters. The disaster had become personal.\nBy May 12, Jwalant had walked for two days and reached the village of Rumchet with tarps, medicine, blankets and rice. That was when the second quake, a massive 7.3 aftershock, struck.\nMore homes crumbled or stood precariously on ledges, waiting for a landslide to take them down. In the chaos, Jwalant spotted a girl traveling with her family. She was missing her left leg and one of her brothers was carrying her on his back. \nJwalant wanted to help.\nHis friend, Bibek Banskota, was an orthopedic surgeon whose father, also a doctor, had returned to Nepal from America many years ago to treat underprivileged children from remote villages. Jwalant knew Bibek would agree to examine the girl.\nIt wasn't easy to convince Maya's father, but Jwalant assured him he would take care of his precious daughter. He brought her back to Kathmandu, where she was treated at the Banskotas' nonprofit Hospital and Rehabilitation Center for Disabled Children, which specializes in pediatric orthopedics. \nIn the weeks that followed, Maya settled into Jwalant's house and was fitted with a prosthetic. \nOutside the hospital, rows and rows of tents provided shelter for earthquake victims desperately needing care. Inside, Maya's life had taken an unexpected turn.\n City life for a village girl\nThe house with the garden where I first see Maya again belongs to Jwalant's parents, Dinesh and Anita. Maya is spending her last day of vacation there before returning to Kathmandu and the start of the new school year.\nTwo of the children Anita and Dinesh have taken in over the years are also here on this day. Ashmaya is 15 now; Nirmala, 25.\nAshmaya fell ill with meningitis as a child, and it left her completely blind. Anita, a retired teacher, pays for her education at a nearby boarding school.\nNirmala is the daughter of a rickshaw puller who was sponsored by an Italian tourist to attend Anita's school. But after three years, he vanished and Anita took Nirmala under her wing. She earned a bachelor's degree in business administration and works for Crystal Mountain Treks. \n\"Nirmala has become like my own daughter,\" Anita tells me, looking with pride at the young woman dressed in jeans and a North Face shirt.\nIn Nirmala, Anita sees what Maya could be one day. But the transformation won't be easy. \nThe village schools in Nepal are often crowded and lack resources and good teachers. Maya was in the fourth grade, but her knowledge and skills were on nursery level when she arrived at her new school in Kathmandu. \nShe didn't speak much. She didn't know any English or even Nepali -- she communicated in the Gurung dialect.\nJwalant's world was alien to Maya. She was plucked from a poor village in one of the poorest countries in the world and suddenly exposed to a lifestyle of upscale restaurants, gyms, private cars and shopping malls.\nAnd it was not just the shock of leaving Kashi Gaon for Kathmandu. Maya was still coping with her own earthquake trauma. \n\"It will take time,\" Anita says. \"Maya is not very open with us. When she first came here she knew nothing. But she has learned many things -- to stay neat and clean, wash her hands before eating, combing her hair. She has learned the alphabet and is speaking a little bit.\"\nAnita pats Maya's shoulder and continues: \"Had Jwalant not met her, what would have happened to her? She is the luckiest girl.\" \nLater in the day, the family gets ready for a friend's wedding. Anita has decided to take Maya with her, as part of her education.\nWeddings in this part of the world can be extravagant events, lavish displays of wealth. At the rented party hall in central Kathmandu, men are in suits and women in expensive silk saris. Maya wears a simple cotton kameez (a long tunic) over black jeans and socks to cover her prosthetic. She follows Anita around. In the receiving line, she cannot take her eyes off the bride, resplendent in a coral sari with gold brocade. \nMaya is not always able to express her hopes and fears. But I can imagine her thinking about the day she might become a bride, about looking like a princess. Perhaps now there is a chance to realize those dreams.\nThe wedding, Anita tells me, is a good life experience for Maya. Maya thinks so too, especially after two servings of ice cream. \nBut everywhere she goes are reminders of who she is and where she came from. \nTwo teenage girls sit next to Maya and ask what grade she is in. \nKindergarten, Maya answers. The girls look surprised and size her up. \nNirmala feels compelled to explain. \"She came from a village.\"\n \nA winner\nThe next morning, Maya returns to Jwalant's house in the city. It's where he was raised. The trekking business consumes the ground floor; Maya sleeps upstairs in the room that once belonged to Jwalant's sister. \nMaya's kindergarten, Angel's Kingdom, is a 10-minute walk from the house. Anything longer than that becomes too painful. When she went home during the break, she walked eight hours to reach her parents' place, the prosthetic leg chafing her skin until it was bloody. \nJwalant takes Maya to see her orthopedic surgeon every three months. Because she is still growing, she has to be fitted with a new leg periodically. When she reaches adulthood, Jwalant hopes to get her a high-tech prosthetic, perhaps titanium.\nAt school, Maya smiles and plays with the innocence of her 5-year-old cohorts.  She rarely talks about the earthquake; she says she doesn't remember everything that happened. Who could blame her if she has willed her memory to be fuzzy? \nIn the heat of summer, her teachers encourage her to remove the prosthetic, but Maya refuses. She wants to look normal.\nJwalant enrolled her at Angel's Kingdom because the small school emphasizes creativity and uses alternative ways of teaching. (Learning by rote tends to be more common in Nepal.) The children are encouraged to draw, sing and interact. \nMaya, says Jwalant, was starving for all these things. He shows me her first-term\n \nreport card -- a series of As and only one B for spelling. \"She is very talented,\" wrote a teacher, \"but needs to improve her speaking ability.\"\nThe grades are no doubt lenient, but Jwalant says Maya has changed during the past year. She is no longer the scared little girl he ran into on a rugged mountainside. Underneath Maya's fragile facade, Jwalant sees a quiet strength. \n\"A child that age to have lost a leg like that, to have gone through all that trauma, she's definitely a winner,\" he says. \n\"I've not seen her sit in the corner and cry, or cry for her parents. I know if I had lost my leg I'd be angry at the world ... but you don't see that in her.\"\nMaya's father says he is content to have his daughter live with Jwalant in Kathmandu. He recognizes the constraints on her if she returned to the village, and he has come to understand the value of schooling.\n\"I will let her stay as long as she can stay,\" he says. \"She has to be happy.\"\nBut caring for Maya isn't always easy for Jwalant, who is not married and does not have children of his own. Maya calls him \"Dai,\" the Nepali term for older brother. I ask if he thinks of Maya as a daughter.\n\"I think I'd say I'm like a godfather because she does have parents, and I don't want to take that from them,\" he says. \n\"I do love her.\"\nLuck -- and fate\nIt's instinctive to think of Maya as a lucky girl, especially in the greater context of Nepal. In some places I visited on my return here, \nthe earthquake feels fresh\n, as though it struck yesterday. That's how slow the recovery process has been. \nHundreds of thousands of Nepalis, including those in Maya's village, are living in temporary or unsafe housing, desperate for assistance so they can get their lives back on track. \n\"I definitely think she was lucky to run into me that day,\" Jwalant tells me one evening. \"But on the other hand, she lost a leg. I don't know how you weigh one against the other.\"\nFrom disaster, he says, came a chance for one little Nepali girl, a chance to learn, to grow, to lead a full life that may have been denied her had she remained secluded in her village, mired in a life of poverty.\nBut as much of a dreamer as Jwalant may be, he is also a pragmatic man. He acknowledges that saving Maya in a moment of utter despair is not enough. Success requires a toughness on Maya's part. She will not succeed, he tells me, if she doesn't have a will of steel. \nI look at Maya as she plays with Jwalant's puppies. They crawl over her back and on top of her head. She smiles and giggles like any young girl. I could not have imagined this scene the first time I saw her wincing in pain on a hospital bed.\nThe earthquake a year ago threatened Maya with lifelong misery. The second tremor created a twist so fortuitous that it made hope possible amid destruction and despair. \nBut her fate in post-earthquake Nepal remains undetermined. Ultimately, only Maya holds the key.", "Would you eat this in space?": "NASA is sure it will be a hit amongst crewmembers on the International Space Station. It declared the dish, created by high school students from Passaic County Technical Institute in Wayne, New Jersey, the winner in this year's culinary challenge. Carolan Terrero, Jada Sanders and Sierra Bronas were on the Passaic team.\n\"The combination of the fire roasted pepper puree, the protein filled edamame, the saltiness of the asiago cheese, along with the creaminess of the rice cooked slowly in our housemade vegetable stock is surely going impress and satisfy the perfect image of a risotto,\" the team wrote in its presentation. \"Within our research, while writing our paper and learning about food preparation in space, we determined that a risotto would work best with the rehydration process and microgravity conditions presented upon the astronauts.\"\nIt was the second culinary challenge through the program \nHigh School Students United with NASA to Create Hardware, or HUNCH\n. This year's competition encouraged high school teams to create a vegetable entree with between 300 and 500 calories (less than 30% of those from fat), 300 mg or less of sodium, 8 grams or less of sugar and 3 grams or more of fiber. It also needed to be something that can be processed well for flight and for use in microgravity, according to NASA. \nISS crewmembers specifically wanted a vegetable entree, rather than just a side dish, according to NASA HUNCH project engineer Alli Westover. \nEdible experiments\nBecause this is STEM program, the high school teams also had to submit a two-minute video and paper detailing how their dish would translate to being rehydrated on the space station. Panel judges included a former astronaut, the ISS deputy program director, the director of Johnson Space Center's Food Lab, HUNCH representatives and food lab scientists. \nThey evaluated each dish using a sensory evaluation sheet, including taste, texture and odor. Panelists praised the risotto for its flavor combination and spiciness, without being too spicy. \nEarlier this year, 21 high school culinary teams from across the country competed in the challenge and submitted their dishes for tasting at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Afterward, the challenge was narrowed to 10 teams who traveled to Johnson Space Center in Houston. They cooked their entrees in the Space Food Systems Laboratory and submitted them before a panel for the final tasting in April. \nThe winning recipe\nComing in at second place was a butternut squash puree from Trussville High School in Trussville, Alabama. A Mexican brown rice paella from the Huntsville Center for Technology in Huntsville, Alabama, followed in third place. \nISS crewmembers Tim Kopra, Jeff Williams and Tim Peake already enjoyed last year's winning entree, a spicy Jamaican rice and beans with coconut milk, after it arrived via SpaceX Dragon cargo vehicle in early April. \nThe risotto will be sent up in November after the Johnson Space Center Food Lab processes it for flight. Most food on the ISS is preserved through freeze-drying or thermostabilization, or preservation by heat.   \n\"Our astronauts are bold, distinguished, and dedicated,\" the winning team wrote in its paper. \"The least we can do to contribute to their commitment is offer our gratitude through our immense passion and devotion to cooking.\"\nWant to try the recipe for yourself? Here is the recipe (before NASA processes it for flight): \nRed pepper risotto\n\u00bd cup arborio rice\n2 teaspoons chili confit\n2 cups housemade vegetable stock\n2 ounces shelled edamame\n2 teaspoons pignoli nuts\n10 basil leaves\n\u00bd ounce Asiago cheese\n\u00bd ounce red pepper puree\n\u2022 In a saucepan, warm the vegetable broth over low heat.\n\u2022 Warm 2 teaspoons chili confit in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.\n\u2022 Add rice, stirring to coat with oil for about 2 minutes.

Are you feeling warm and happy? Or do you just want to rip the strings right out of that folksy guitar?\nWhichever one is you, psychologists have found that your taste in music says a lot about your personality. \n\"People who are high on empathy may be preferring a certain type of music compared to people who are more systematic,\" said \nDavid Greenberg\n, a University of Cambridge psychologist. \nGreenberg \nhas quizzed thousands of people\n, first giving them a written test to analyze their personalities and then finding out what types of music they prefer. \nHe found a correlation: Those who have a well-developed ability to understand thoughts and feelings in themselves and others -- so-called \"empathizers\" -- tend to prefer mellow music that evokes deep emotion. \nBut the world is full of underlying patterns and systems, and those who can more easily identify these connections are \"systemizers.\" Greenberg's research shows they prefer intense music that forms complex sounds. \nThe theory, he said, is that empathizers are interested in music's emotional qualities and how it makes them feel, whereas systemizers are more intrigued by its structural qualities.\n\"They are focusing more on the instrumental elements, seeing how the music is mixing together,\" Greenberg said. \"It's almost like a musical puzzle that they're putting together.\"\nMusic taste reflects personality\nSystemizers lean toward jobs in math and science: the meteorologist who rapidly deciphers emerging weather patterns, the geologist who untangles eons of mystery about how a mountain formed.\nEmpathizers tend to be good listeners. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. Systemizers can have an average or even high ability to do this, too -- they don't lack empathy per se -- but their systemizing abilities are even greater, Greenberg said. \nHe found people who like both mellow music and intense music score about the same in empathizing and systemizing tests, indicating a \"balanced\" thinking style. \n\"We are seeking music that reflects who we are, so that includes personality, that includes the way we think, and it may even be the way our brain is wired,\" Greenberg says.\nOne hypothesis: Listening to mellow music can make us feel sad, so our brain may release a pleasing hormone to soothe us -- and empathizers may get a bigger dose, since the region of their brain responsible for regulating the chemical's release is larger. Systemizers' brains are bigger in regions responsible for recognizing patterns, so when they hear intense or highly structured music they may prefer it for its complexity. \nTest your taste in music\nAre you an empathizer or a systemizer? Or you could be balanced. Take our music quiz to find out. \nAbout the songs\nGreenberg and his team of psychologists found empathizers prefer music that inspires strong feelings, often sadness, such as Joni Mitchell's \"Blue.\" These songs often feature themes of love, loss, relationships, heartbreak and nostalgia. Not only are the lyrics to Bill Withers' \"Ain't No Sunshine\" about melancholia and loss, but the song is also in a minor key that's typically associated with sad feelings. Neil Young's \"Philadelphia\" is about brotherly love and loss. The chorus of Adele's \"Hello\" is about the desire to communicate regret and sorrow. Ray Charles' \"Georgia on My Mind\" is also in a minor key and is about remembering a lost loved one through a sweet but sorrowful song.\nGreenberg's team found systemizers prefer music that tends to be more energetic, often eliciting joy or even anger through charged lyrics and intricate patterns of notes. Led Zeppelin's \"Black Dog\" is about finding happiness with a woman. Hendrix's \"Voodoo Child\" and Rage Against the Machine's \"Bulls on Parade\" are aggressive songs about rebellion. \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses is an exhilarating rock anthem about the temptation of drugs. \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" by the Ramones is an animated, joy-inducing song written in a major key that's often associated with more positive emotions.  \nBalanced music lovers tend to prefer songs across the spectrum.", "Meldonium: the drug that got Maria Sharapova suspended": "The drug, known as meldonium or mildronate, is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, but it is \nprescribed elsewhere\n to help protect heart tissue by regulating metabolism.

If you're the mom in this scenario, you may take comfort in knowing you are not alone when trying not to wet your pants.\nThis involuntary leaking condition post-pregnancy -- called urinary incontinence -- affects many women, though you might not know it.\n \nIt's unlikely that a clinical, or informational, video on the condition would get on your radar to make you any more aware of the issue, so HelloFlo decided to shake things up -- by making you laugh.\nThe company, which has recently been acquired by \nSheKnows Media\n, uses humor in every video it produces. \nNaama Bloom\n, the founder of HelloFlo, sees humor as a way to open conversations among women about health topics no one likes to talk about but everyone experiences.\n\"It's like an ice breaker,\" said Bloom, who is also senior vice president of integrated marketing for SheKnows Media. \"I think the thing, at least with women, is that when we get together with our friends and we actually open (up), we laugh and we giggle about this stuff.\" She wanted to tap into those private conversations that women are already having and make them public.\nBloom has a lot of experience in making women laugh. Some of her earlier work went viral and encouraged women of all ages to talk more freely about topics such as menstruation.\nHer first hit, \"Camp Gyno\" -- \nwhich we reported on in 2013\n -- was about a girl who gets her period at summer camp. It has been viewed more than \n11 million times on YouTube\n alone. \"\nHalf Moon Party,\n\" about a girl pretending to get her first period, was her most successful video yet, with more than 36 million views on YouTube.\nHer \nnewest video also focuses on menstruation\n. We meet the character \"Aunt Flo,\" who makes her presence known to a young girl hoping to get her period soon. A young couple worries that \"Flo\" is a few days late after they have been sexually active, and a woman prepares for menopause by saying goodbye to \"Flo,\" whom she has known for many years.\nA lot of these transition moments in a woman's life are clumsy and awkward, said Bloom. \"If you laugh at it and you see that other people are going through it, it doesn't feel quite so isolating.\"\n'The vagina can be in the joke, but it can't be the joke'\nThere are definitely challenges in using humor to bring attention to an issue or a product, said Julie Cottineau, author of \n\"Twist: How Fresh Perspectives Build Breakthrough Brands.\"\n\"You have to make it clear from the very beginning that you're laughing with your target and not at them, and that's a fine line. It's easy to get that wrong,\" said Cottineau, former vice president of brand for Virgin Management and founder of \nBrand School, \na premiere online program for small businesses, nonprofits and entrepreneurs.\nShe stresses the need for empathy. \"You have to know what they're really thinking. I think you have to use the language and the jokes that they would use in conversations with their best girlfriends.\"\nBloom wholeheartedly agrees, and while she thinks humor is great, she says it can also be very dangerous. \"It's never about laughing about someone. It's always about laughing at a shared experience.\"\nDuring the development of \"Camp Gyno,\" Bloom gave some wise words to her creative team. \"The vagina can be in the joke, but it can't be the joke,\" she told them. \"You can reference something, but you can't make fun of it.\"\nBringing attention to taboo topics\nCottineau\n adds that humor works best when it has some purpose in advancing an issue. She uses the \n2013 video advertisement for Poo-pourri\n as a case study in her brand school. \nThe advertisement showcases a debutante-like woman, with her pearls and crinoline-lined dress, talking about the huge poop she just did and the quandary over what to do about the smell that lingers after you have a massive bowel movement at work or at your boyfriend's house.\n\"We use that as a case study, because I think by showing this woman who is somebody who would never admit to pooping because she's very proper ... it defuses the situation for the rest of us,\" Cottineau said. \"By portraying sort of the last person that you would expect to see on the toilet talking about poop, they're making it clear that it's OK for the rest of us to talk about it and think about it.\"\nAn unusual approach is also used in the \nvideo for the Squatty Potty.\n The advertisement uses a unicorn and the \"rainbow poop\" it produces to call attention to improper toilet posture and the best position for the healthiest bowel movements.\n\"They're talking about colons and what's really actually helping keep your colon healthy, but I don't think people would listen to them if they had done it straight on,\" Cottineau said. \"I think they had to go really over the top to make a subject that's kind of taboo seem like one that we should pay attention to.\"\nAt a time when people are bombarded with so many messages and images, bringing attention to taboo topics is no easy task. But the universal appeal is that these are stories and characters everyone can identify with.\n\"You want to connect to a character and be able to see it through their eyes and then understand how that can help you process what's going on in your own life,\" Bloom said. \"So I think that's why videos work, just because you have an ability to tell stories.\"\nHow much do you think humor can help when it comes to sparking conversation about difficult topics?

", "Weed users found to have poorer verbal memory": "Marijuana use is increasingly common among adolescents and young adults in the United States. In fact, a \nrecent survey of high school students found\n more teens use marijuana than tobacco. One reason: a perception that it's not harmful \nFor this study, researchers randomly selected more than 5,000 young adults from 18 and 30 and followed up with them at varying points over 25 years. At the end of the 25 years, there were more than 3,400 participants still in the study. Their cognitive function was measured using standardized tests of verbal memory, processing speed and executive function. \nThey found\n current marijuana use was associated with poorer verbal memory and processing speed, and lifetime exposure to marijuana was associated with worse performance in all three areas of cognitive function. Although past exposure to marijuana was associated with worse verbal memory, it does not appear to affect other domains of cognitive function. \nIt is unclear whether there are long-term effects on memory from occasional marijuana use earlier in life and whether there is an impact on other areas of cognitive function. \nFor every five years of past marijuana exposure, verbal memory was lower -- about half of participants remembered one word fewer from a list of 15 words, according to the study.\n\"In this study, there are as much women as men, as much black as white, as much lower education as higher education,\" said Dr. Reto Auer, one of the study's authors. \n\"It provides a better sense of what the association is in the overall population.\"\nAuer said there is a lack of well-performed studies on this topic. As is often the case, more research is needed, he said. \nPrevious studies show similar and consistent results about the potential effects of using marijuana over time. \nResearchers in New Zealand found\n people who used marijuana frequently over several decades had poorer cognitive function than those who did not participate in regular use. \"Regular\" reflects those with five cumulative years of marijuana use over the lifetime. The study analyzed IQ at 13, before marijuana was used, and again at 38. The results showed that the early initiators and constant users demonstrated the largest decline in IQ scores.  \nWith the liberalization of medical marijuana laws in the United States, it is becoming easier for adolescents to participate in persistent, daily use of marijuana, according to a \ncommentary\n also published in JAMA Internal Medicine. \nThis change is making marijuana more readily accessible and could possibly impact the increase of marijuana use in the United States, it  said.\n\"The public health challenge is to find effective ways to inform young people who use, or are considering using, marijuana about the cognitive and other risks of long-term daily use,\" wrote authors Wayne Hall of the Center for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland in Australia and Michael Lynskey of the National Addiction Centre at King's College London.  \n\"Young adults may be skeptical about advice on the putative adverse health effects of marijuana, which they may see as being overstated to justify the prohibition on its use,\" the authors write. \"More research on how young people interpret evidence of harm from marijuana and other drugs would be useful in designing more effective health advice.\"  \nFollow CNN Health on\n Facebook\n and \nTwitter\n.", "E. coli outbreak prompts massive General Mills flour recall": "Out of an abundance of caution, \nGeneral Mills announced \nthe voluntary recall of more than 10 million pounds of flour because it may be linked to the outbreak.\nApproximately half of the ill individuals reported making something homemade with flour before becoming ill, and some of them reported using a General Mills brand of flour, the company said in a news release.\nThe illnesses occurred between December 21 and May 3, according to General Mills.\n\"To date E. coli O121 has not been found in any General Mills flour products or in the flour manufacturing facility, and the company has not been contacted directly by any consumer reporting confirmed illnesses related to these products,\" the company said, adding that some of the ill individuals also consumed raw dough or batter.\nEating raw dough or batter that is \"intended for cooking\" is not recommended.

Here's why you might want to \nopen a page and say ahhhhhh\n.\nDailyBurn: The One Thing That Helped Me Lose Weight\nArt Therapy, Adult Coloring Books and Your Mental Health\nAccording to the American Art Therapy Association, art therapy is a mental health profession in which the process of making and creating artwork is used to \"explore feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, manage behavior and addictions, develop social skills, improve reality orientation, reduce anxiety and increase self-esteem.\" So basically, it's similar to good old therapy. (Don't think you need therapy? \nHere's why you should take a mental health day now\n) Yet art therapy is not only about learning and improving yourself \u2014 it's a means of personal expression, too.\nDailyBurn: 21 Meal Prep Pics from the Healthiest People on Instagram\nHowever, it is important to note that using an adult coloring book is not exactly the same as completing an art therapy session. \"Coloring itself cannot be called art therapy because art therapy relies on the relationship between the client and the therapist,\" says Marygrace Berberian, a certified art therapist and the Clinical Assistant Professor and Program Coordinator for the Graduate Art Therapy Program at NYU. And while art therapy was first practiced in the 1940s, the first research on using coloring as therapy is generally believed to have only begun as recently the mid 90s, according to Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association.\nDailyBurn: 9 Weight Loss Success Stories You're Going to Want to See\nThe Health Benefits of Adult Coloring Books\nDespite the fact that coloring and art therapy aren't quite the same thing, coloring does offer a slew of mental benefits. \"Coloring definitely has therapeutic potential to reduce anxiety, create focus or \nbring [about] more mindfulness\n,\" says Berberian. Groundbreaking research in 2005 proved anxiety levels dropped when subjects colored mandalas, which are round frames with geometric patterns inside. Simply doodling, though, had no effect in reducing the other subjects' stress levels.\nJust like meditation, coloring also allows us to switch off our brains from other thoughts and focus only on the moment, helping to alleviate free-floating anxiety. It can be particularly effective for people who aren't comfortable with more creatively expressive forms of art, says Berberian, \"My experience has been that those participants who are more guarded find a lot of tranquility in coloring an image. It feels safer and it creates containment around their process,\" she adds.\nHow to Get Started \nWant to fill in some pages? Keep in mind, if you're dealing with significant mental or emotional issues, art therapy is going to be more effective than coloring solo. But for those who just need a hobby to help them chill out, these books could be the ticket. As Berberian puts it, \"I truly believe that people should be engaging in activities that make them feel restored.\"\nAccording to ColoringBooks.net, adults should skip the crayons and go straight for the colored pencils (precision is everything when it comes to tuning in). And Crayola has a complete guide that shows how to take your tools up a notch by blending colors, shading and adding highlights and lowlights to your newfound masterpieces. Now get scribbling!", "Why 'shelfies,' not selfies, are a better snapshot of who you are": "This proclivity has paid off for me big-time. Before we started dating, my now-wife, Kate, developed what she called the bookshelf theory of dating. She had met someone at a party in her apartment a couple of years earlier who asked questions about her books, one in particular. That was telling, Kate told her friends; interest in her bookshelf was a quality she wanted in a partner. Years later, on one of our early dates, I brought up the same book, still on her shelf, and she cut me off. \"It was you! You were the person who asked me about my books. I developed a whole theory of dating around you!\" \nOur fate must have been written.\nBookshelves have been surprisingly good for me, but they hold tangible benefits for everyone. You may not have a biography written about your life, but you have a personal bibliography. And many of the books you read influence your thoughts and life in often deeper and longer-lasting ways than film, television, music and other attention-grabbing pleasures. \n\"How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book?\" Henry David Thoreau asked rhetorically, referring to nearly everyone. That was long before there were ubiquitous screens, but it's still true.\nBooks as therapy\nIf a book can change your life, why leave that to serendipity? The trend toward bibliotherapy -- a strategy of seeking books that aid you through difficult times and aspects of your life -- is \nstarting to catch on\n. \n\"Reading literature can increase a person's happiness, decrease stress, and unlock the imagination,\" is how \nBiblioRemedy\n describes the goals of its bibliotherapy, in which a specialist talks to you about about the issues you're wrestling with and recommends books to help you sort them out. \nElla Berthoud and Susan Elderkin,\n bibliotherapists at London's School of Life\n, have written -- what else? -- a book on the topic. In \"\nThe Novel Cure: An A-Z of Literary Remedies\n,\" they show how Gabriel Garcia Marquez can help overcome a fear of death and Patricia Highsmith can cure lovesickness.\nWe've probably all been bibliotherapists at some point. When I meet young people in the midst of their searching-for-the-meaning-of-life stage, I recommend \"The Razor's Edge\" by W. Somerset Maugham. For those who've seen a thing or two, I've given \"To Bless the Space Between Us,\" John O'Donohue's poems on the human experience. And for friends who have experienced true tragedy I have shared Pema Chodron's \"When Things Fall Apart,\" in hopes it may offer them some guidance through their grief. \nBooks, and stories in particular, are probably the greatest source of wisdom after experience (as I argued on the TEDx stage, diving deep into the \nmeaning of a single ancient Taoist parable\n). You aren't just more knowledgeable the more you read, but you have more insight into life, love and the other big topics that matter most. \nReading as exercise\nEven when we read for pleasure, we usually learn something (which you can rarely say of entertainment television). \"Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body,\" wrote the English politician and writer Joseph Addison.  \nResearch backs this up. \"Literacy propels the development of new, neuronal networks in the brain -- particularly in specific forms of connectivity between visual and language regions. That, in turn, create the potential for increasingly complex thought,\" explained Maryanne Wolf, author of \"Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain\" and director of the \nCenter for Reading and Language Research\n at Tufts University.\nThe benefits of a lifetime of reading are exponential and have \"profound implications for the development of a wide range of cognitive capabilities,\" wrote researchers in the Journal of Direct Instruction. The 2001 study showed \nlanguage acquisition is more impacted outside of formal teaching settings\n, most profoundly from books. The exposure to vocabulary is so much greater from them than from television or from spoken language that even a preschool book offers more new words than listening to an adult TV show or a conversation between two college-educated adults. Strong early reading skills have also been linked to \nhigher intelligence as adults\n. \nFiction is just as insightful as nonfiction, if not more so. Is there a reference book about love, for example, that is better at capturing its essence than Ian McEwan's \"Atonement\"? Tim O'Brien effectively illustrates in \"The Things They Carried\" that just because something didn't happen doesn't mean it's not true; it may be more true because it's fiction. And reading fiction enhances connectivity in the brain and \nimproves brain function\n in ways nonfiction doesn't, according to researchers at Emory University in a study from 2013.\nLet's not discriminate, though. Nonfiction, fiction, reference books, children's lit, sci-fi, poetry: All are portals of discovery and meaning. Books, rather than bite-sized posts and podcasts, take you spelunking instead of merely peering into the cave.\nYour ideal bookshelf\nThe impact of books on the lives of people is the inspiration behind a fascinating volume titled \"\nMy Ideal Bookshelf\n,\" in which Thessaly La Force interviewed a wide variety of writers and thought leaders, from Malcolm Gladwell to Patti Smith, about the books they value most. Artist Jane Mount then painted their books on a virtual bookshelf to illustrate each profile.  \n\"The reason I started the project was by looking at people's bookshelves and thinking about what that taught me about them,\" Mount explained. She and La Force agreed it would be fascinating to see the ideal bookshelves of certain people (not necessarily famous ones), so they began asking. And by painting the books those individuals considered their favorites, or the ones that made them who they are, or changed them in some way, it creates what Mount describes as a \"portrait from the inside ... almost like a book aura.\"\n\"It's fascinating that you can take something so basic as a book spine -- just a rectangle with words -- but it represents so many huge ideas about what's inside.\"\nMount's theory about why books affect us in deeper ways than other media is that \"when you're forced to imagine things, they stick in your brain longer.\" And after painting more than 1,000 ideal bookshelves (\nyou can commission your own through her website\n), she has noticed a trend toward books that formed a strong emotional bond with the reader when they were young. The most recurring book on people's commissioned bookshelves? Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" followed by J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye.\"\nIt's a fun and insightful exercise to ponder your ideal bookshelf. Which books have influenced you the most? Which volumes make your heart soar or brain buzz? Which do you reread because, at different stages of life, they reveal new insights? Or which ones do you find so enjoyable that you return to immerse yourself in the story again and again? And what do they collectively say about you? \nTo e-book or not to E?\nAs for e-books, warming your hands over the Kindle is fine, too, arguably useful when traveling and \nmore environmentally friendly\n. And audio books, when well produced, are practically a new art form. But personally, I find there's something less comforting about pixelated and audio books, and less satisfying about completing them. They're less read-in-the-bathtub friendly and more expensive when dropped. There's even research that shows electronic book consumption \ninhibits reading comprehension and recall\n, if you want a scientific reason to eschew them.\nBut consuming good books is more important than the medium in which you do so. \nAnd if you prefer e-books, that's another argument for maintaining a virtual bookshelf. \"People want to own physical books less but they still want a record,\" said Mount. \nIt was for a similar reason that 20 years ago I began drawing books on a virtual bookshelf of my own. \nThe 20-year bookshelf\nThe gallery above is my hand drawings of the spines of every* book I've read since my last year of college, sketched in various writers' notebooks I've kept over two decades. (*Well, not every kids' book that I read to my young children, but some of the better ones.) Spines, as Mount points out in her book, are \"totally lost in the digital age.\"\nThe drawings started out as an artistic lark and ended up a literary timeline of my adult life. I love looking them over and seeing the books that jog memories of eras of my life: what I read my middle school students as a reading teacher in Teach For America (including \"The Catcher in the Rye\"), while living in Dublin, Ireland (\"The Portable Beat Reader\"), living in San Francisco (\"McTeague\" by Frank Norris), traveling around the world for a year (Paul Bowles' \"The Sheltering Sky\" in Morocco, Vikram Seth's \"A Suitable Boy\" on long train rides in India), starting my job at The New York Times (Gay Talese's \"The Kingdom and the Power\"), becoming a father (\"Protecting the Gift\" by Gavin de Becker), and on long flights overseas while working for the BBC (Russell Brand's \"My Booky Wook\"). \nMany moves, plus access to great libraries in various cities, have meant I've only retained a small fraction of the books I've read, no matter how much I've loved them. And speaking of retained, my shelf is also a reference -- an \naide-memoire\n, as Proust might put it -- when I want to recommend something I can't quickly recall.\nThere are apps/sites that can help you track your reading consumption. The literary social network \nGoodreads.com\n, bought by Amazon, is probably the largest. But by drawing the book spines myself, I see the exact edition and copy of the one I read. And the act of drawing them is a slow, meditative art experience I look forward to with every new one. The only downside I've found with this project is that it has made me a bit OCD about reading entire books. If I read a parenting book for insight on my 4- and 8-year olds, I'll read the chapter on babies too, because I don't think it counts for the bookshelf otherwise. \nThere's a desire in our collective human experience to mark ephemeral time with the corporeal. For some, tattoos connect them to dates and places of their lives. Others collect vials of sands from beaches, or coffee mugs from the cities they visit. Many keep journals, many more create photo albums, and many more chronicle on Facebook. The virtual bookshelf is just another form of that. A great one, I'd argue.\nSo, whatever else you're bingeing on these days -- podcasts, magazines, Netflix, Candy Crush, cat videos or CNN news -- make sure you're still getting a steady, healthy diet of pulp. And keep your books on a bookshelf, real or virtual, to enjoy the memories.", "The real reason Mary Ingalls went blind": "The television show and popular book series -- and maybe even \na \"Little House\" movie in the near future\n -- draw on the real-life experiences of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Mary, Laura's sister, went blind as a teenager after contracting scarlet fever, according to the story. Recently, a team of medical researchers raised the question about whether that's true.\nDr. Beth Tarini, one of the co-authors of the paper, became intrigued by the question as a medical student.\n\"I was in my pediatrics rotation. We were talking about scarlet fever, and I said, 'Oh, scarlet fever makes you go blind. Mary Ingalls went blind from it,'\" recalls Tarini, who is now an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. My supervisor said, \"I don't think so.\"\nTarini started doing research. Over the course of 10 years, she and her team of researchers pored over old papers and letters written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, local newspaper accounts of Mary's illness and epidemiological data on blindness and infectious disease in the late 19th century. What they found was intriguing.\nIn Wilder's unpublished memoir, \"Pioneer Girl,\" there is no reference to Mary having scarlet fever the year she went blind. (She did have scarlet fever when she was much younger.) \"She never says scarlet fever. She never says rash,\" Tarini says, pointing out the rash is a telltale sign of scarlet fever.\nDigging deeper, when researchers looked at epidemiological data from the time, they saw that most cases of blindness attributed to scarlet fever were temporary. In addition, newspaper accounts of Mary's illness report \"severe headaches\" and one side of her face being partially paralyzed.\nFinally, and perhaps the most important piece of evidence, in a letter Wilder wrote to her daughter, Rose, right before her book \"By the Shores of Silver Lake\" was published, she makes reference \"some sort of spinal sickness.\" The letter also mentions that Mary saw a specialist in Chicago who said \"the nerves of her eyes were paralyzed and there was no hope.\"\nDiagnosis by these disease detectives: viral meningoencephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain and the meninges, the membrane that covers the brain. In severe cases, it can cause inflammation of the optic nerve that can result in a slow and progressive loss of sight.\nIt may not be the biggest bombshell to hit the medical world, but to \"Little House\" fans, the question remains: Why did Wilder change her sister's illness to scarlet fever? The study authors believe it could be because Wilder and her editors thought scarlet fever would be more relatable to her readers. Scarlet fever is mentioned in other books from the period, including \"Little Women\" and \"Frankenstein.\"\nBut there is also an important wider medical lesson we can learn from this research. Today, about 10% of people infected with strep get scarlet fever, says Tarini. It is easily treatable. But because the cultural reference to scarlet fever is so ingrained in our culture, people assume it is very dangerous. \"People read as children that scarlet fever makes you go blind,\" says Tarini. \"Parents look concerned ... so I have to debunk it in the office.\"\nThe study was published \nin the journal Pediatrics in March 2013\n.\nFollow CNN Health on\n Facebook\n and \nTwitter\n.", "No, you haven't read this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu story before": "But we know less about why we have the feeling. Is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu evidence of a past life, an out of body experience or just a good old neural misfire? \nMost researchers who study this area of the brain vote for the last option, and they are busy trying to find all the reasons why.\nWho gets d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\nAbout \ntwo-thirds \nof us experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at least once in our lives, experts say. While there's no gender difference when it comes to the phenomenon, age does seem to matter. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes drop dramatically in older adults; in fact, most reports come from people between age 15 and 25, leading some to wonder if d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is connected to brain development. We now know the brain isn't fully formed until at least age 25, maybe even later. \nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is also most common in people with \nhigher education\n and socioeconomic class, and those who watch \nmore movies and travel often\n. If d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is all about familiarity-based recognition, there's some logic to these statistics: Travel is most common among those with higher incomes, and traveling provides more opportunities to see new physical locations that might trigger a sense of familiarity, especially if those locations may have appeared in a previously viewed movie scene. \n\"Memory is far from perfect. We simply fail to recall everything that we encounter in day-to-day life,\" explained \nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu researcher Anne Cleary\n. \"However, just because something fails to be recalled doesn't mean that the memory isn't still 'in there' somewhere; often it is, and it is just failing to be accessed. These types of memories might be what drive the sense of familiarity that presumably underlies d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\"\nResearch also shows d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is more likely to happen if a person is under pressure or fatigued. Perhaps when we're tired, stressed or distracted we only recall a fraction of an event, just enough to trigger a sense of familiarity. \nA \n2010 study \nfound those of us who frequently remember our dreams seem to have more d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences. Dreams are notorious for being less than faithful to reality. Add that to the already fallible memory system of our brains, and you can see why the two might interact to create a feeling of familiarity; maybe you dreamed it, or something like it.\nThere's actually a term for dream d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: d\u00e9j\u00e0 reve, French for \"dreamed before.\" About 86% of college students surveyed as part of a study report reliving events they remember from dreams.  Cleary said she believes this might happen when you dream about something you've experienced, but later only remember the dream, not the event itself.\nThe brain on d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nSince having a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience is unpredictable, it has been tough to study. That's why some researchers are focused on the brains of patients with a certain form of epilepsy: specifically, those who often experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu during the \"auras\" that occur right before a seizure. \n\"The epilepsy patients whose seizures tend to trigger d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu have generally been patients whose seizures originate in the medial temporal region of the brain,\" said Cleary. \"This same area of the brain is involved in memory.\"\nIn the medial temporal lobe of the brain sits the rhinal cortex, which helps us recognize that something is familiar. Close by is the hippocampus, responsible for new memory storage. Not far away is the amygdala, in charge of our emotions, which can drive memory storage and retrieval.\nBy sending an electric current into the medial temporal region of the brain, researchers have been able to trigger d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences in epileptic patients and map brain activity. They found that even though the hippocampus is responsible for memory, it's easier to induce d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu via the rhinal cortex, the portion of the brain responsible for feelings of familiarity. Yet all three brain structures appear to be active during the episode.\nPatients in these studies report two types of seizure experiences: One involves a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu familiarity, the other a more vivid and complete recollection of an event from the past. That's known as d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu', or \"already lived.\" It has been suggested the two may fall on a \ncontinuum\n, with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu being a sort of low-level form of failed recollection. \nHarnessing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu into precognition?\nCleary, a cognitive psychologist Colorado State University, is using today's technology to recreate the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. She has created a 3-D virtual village she calls \"Deja Ville,\" based on the popular Sims 2 game, and is using it to explore the concept of Gestalt familiarity, the arrangement of objects within a scene.\n\"For every original scene created, we created another, different scene that mapped onto that original scene in its spatial configuration -- the configuration of elements on the grid,\" said Cleary. \"For example, if the original scene was a courtyard with a potted tree in the middle, surrounded by flower beds and hanging pots on the courtyard walls, the corresponding similar scene might be a museum with a statue in the middle where the potted tree had been, surrounded by rugs in the same configuration as the flower beds, and candelabra in the same configuration as the hanging pots.\"\nShe also presented the subjects completely novel scenes, which didn't have any similar elements that might be \"mapped\" and recognized. She found there was a greater likelihood of reported d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences when subjects failed to recall one of the previously seen mapped scenes. \nShe's now using the 3-D model to see if the memories that underlie a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience can help us predict what happens next, serving as a form of \"precognition.\"\n\"It's conceivable that a previous experience that exists in memory but that fails to be retrieved might not only produce a sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu upon encountering a highly similar situation, but also produce a sense of how the current event is supposed to unfold,\" explained Cleary, \"such as which direction to turn next within the scene.\" \nCould those insights give d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu a reason for its existence?\n\"Even when we fail to retrieve a memory,\" said Cleary, \"our brains might have a way of signaling to us that there is possibly a relevant memory in there somewhere. That signal might be useful in that it can prompt us to keep searching our memory for whatever it is that is in there that might be relevant to the current situation.\"", "Whole-wheat bread and other 'healthy' foods diet experts avoid": "No-Sugar-Added Ice Cream\n\"I never buy no-sugar-added or light ice creams.

", "Facing Zika fears: Raising kids with microcephaly": "\"She loves to just go constantly,\" her mother, Angelina, said. \"She never sits down, which, you know, isn't too bad for a little girl that wasn't supposed to walk.\"\nAnika's head and brain are underdeveloped, the result of a rare birth defect called microcephaly. \nIn the U.S., for every 10,000 babies born, only two to 12 will have the condition. Although the cause is largely a mystery, it's been linked to random or inherited genetics, malnutrition and certain infections during pregnancy.\nAn unproven but strongly suspected link to the Zika virus that is rapidly spreading across the Americas has raised recent fear and concern. Brazil and French Polynesia are seeing alarming spikes in babies born with microcephaly, and the \nWorld Health Organization estimates 3 to 4 million people\n in the Americas will contract Zika within the next 12 months. \n\"We just want people to see that she's not scary,\" Angelina said about Anika. \"There's nothing scary about microcephaly. It's not always easy, but she's a blessing.\"\n'Micro mommies'\nOn the day Anika was born, a neurologist told Angelina and the baby's father, Jesse Carter, that their daughter would never show emotion, or be able to eat on her own, or recognize them as her parents. Her life would be short, perhaps no longer than a year.\nAngelina was undeterred. If doctors couldn't help Anika, she figured maybe other families raising children with microcephaly could. She found 50 moms on the Internet. Among them, by utter providence, was a mom in her own city, Gwen Hartley, who had two daughters with the condition.\n\"She opened her arms to us immediately,\" Angelina said. \"I lean on Gwen all the time. She's who I cry to, and who I vent to. She's always been there for us.\"\nGwen and her husband, Scott, received a devastatingly similar microcephaly diagnosis years earlier after their daughter, Claire, was born. The signs and symptoms were evident even on the day of her birth.\n\"She looked so cute, and she was so tiny. And I remember my first words were, 'Oh my gosh, you forget how tiny their little heads are.'\"\nThe doctor asked Gwen what she was going to name her baby. \"Claire,\" Gwen answered.\n\"Claire is a beautiful name,\" the doctor told her. \"I just want to let you know that there could be some problems with Claire.\"\n\"Well, we'll fix them,\" Gwen casually replied.\n\"I'm just not sure we can,\" the doctor said.\nThe Hartleys were crushed. They were told Claire would likely be dead within a year. \nThe months that followed were full of anxiety. Their young son, Cal, who was born healthy, once asked, \"Mom, when is Jesus coming for Claire?\" His question made his mother cry, saddened that her son had to worry about losing his little sister.\nBut Claire did not die that year. Or the next one. Or the one after that. When she was 4, the Hartleys decided to have a third child. Their perinatologist, a doctor who works with mothers on complicated, high-risk pregnancies, encouraged them.\n\"I remember him saying, 'You guys seriously have a 75% chance or greater that it's going to be fine, so just go in knowing that -- knowing we'll check the whole pregnancy and it's going to be fine.'\"\nThe pregnancy was not fine. At 26 weeks, doctors confirmed microcephaly. The Hartleys' second daughter, Lola, was born with the same condition as her older sister. \nToday, Claire is 14 years old and Lola is 9. In addition to microcephaly, the girls have dwarfism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. They are still tiny -- roughly the size of a toddler and a large baby. Claire weighs about 23 pounds and Lola weighs about 12 pounds. They suffer seizures and have stiff muscle tone.\n\"You can diagnose them however you want, but they're just the sweetest, cutest little girls that I've ever been around,\" Scott said. \"We just love them to death.\"\nAngelina and Gwen like to bring their girls together for barbecues, hot tub swim sessions and other play dates.\n\"The girls have a chance to be around kids like them, rather than going to the park and having everybody point and stare,\" Angelina said. \"The girls can just be themselves and hang out.\"\nFor Angelina, Gwen has become a source of inspiration -- a time-tested, veteran \"micro mommy\" who's helped Claire and Lola far outlive the doctors' prognosis for their lives.\n\"You have spouses to lean on, or other families, but it's different with a mom that goes through it every single day,\" Angelina said.\nGwen is equally impressed by Angelina. \"She's a badass mom,\" Gwen said. \"She's probably one of the only other moms I know that's literally tried like a bazillion different things to make things work for her kid, and has found things that worked and defied odds.\"\nOther moms can 'totally do this'\nGwen prays the moms in Brazil and French Polynesia who are now raising babies born with microcephaly, potentially from Zika, get help and resources. She knows the support system needed for them will be huge. \n\"I couldn't have done it without my team of therapists and doctors and people that cared about me and helped me figure how to do this and find my path,\" she said.\nFor moms living in a region far poorer than her own, she knows it's a lot to pray for. \"They can totally do this,\" she said. \"It's going to be the most trying experience of their life, but also the most rewarding.\"\nAs Zika continues its spread throughout the Americas, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, has called for a repeal of strict abortion laws that exist in many Latin American countries, including Brazil, so that women can choose whether to end their pregnancies. \n\"Upholding human rights is essential to an effective public health response and this requires that governments ensure women ... have access to ... safe abortion services,\" Hussein said in \na U.N. statement\n issued last week.\nIn Colombia, where abortion is legal in some instances, pregnant women are, \naccording to The New York Times\n, \"considering -- and, in some cases, having -- abortions before any microcephaly cases have appeared in the country.\"\n\"The first time we heard doctors were encouraging abortion, it broke my heart,\" Angelina said. \nAngelina and Jesse were encouraged to abort her pregnancy. \"They told us, you know, no one is going to judge you if you go ahead and abort the baby and have healthy children later on. And if we had listened to them and believed that Anika was never going to do anything, she wouldn't be where she is today,\" Angelina said.\n\"That's the best decision we've ever had because she's just an amazing girl,\" Jesse said.\nAfter Lola's microcephaly was detected, the Hartleys were also offered an abortion. \"I gave it a lot of thought. For me it didn't feel right,\" Gwen said. \"Knowing I had Claire, knowing I knew how to take care of her already, I just knew I could do it a second time.\"\nShe added that she would not judge women in Zika-affected countries who make the other choice. \"I'm not walking in their shoes,\" Gwen said. \"Alternately, if they choose to have this child I can guarantee them that it's going to change their lives in a positive way, and they're going to realize the depths of love that they're capable of.\"", "Study finds new potential treatment for jet lag": "But scientists at Stanford University say there may be a way to prevent jet lag without medication or adjusting your sleep schedule. \nA team of researchers led by neurobiologist Jamie Zeitzer is working on a technique that exposes people to short flashes of light while they sleep to help them adjust more quickly to time zone changes. \nCurrent light therapy treatment includes sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day, which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip. Zeitzer's latest study, \npublished Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation\n, could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine.\nExploiting biology 'in the eye'\nResearchers believe the flashing light helps reset the \ncircadian system\n, which regulates rhythms in the human body and establishes normal sleep and wake phases. \nThe circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light; it controls sleep timing, hormone release and mood, said Zeitzer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms. \nTo adapt to a new time zone, most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination, either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive, Zeitzer said. Or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences; the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day, taking up to three days to catch up.\nThrough light therapy, the technique Zeitzer is experimenting with, a person's brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. The treatment \"exploits biology in the eye\" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said. \nCan this app cure jet lag?\nThis study builds on previous research published in 2014, which found that light therapy works best at night because the body's circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. In this latest study, Zeitzer and Raymond Najjar, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at Singapore Eye Research Institute, found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip.\n\"The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?\" Zeitzer said. This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process. \nContinuous light vs. flashes\nTo determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles, researchers recruited 39 participants ages 19 to 36. They put them on a routine sleep-wake cycle, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks. They then had the volunteers sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour.\nThey found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, every 10 seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light. Participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking.\n\"You get more effectiveness out of flashes of light. It will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light, which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment,\" Zeitzer said. \nThe treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules, he said, but that's a long way off. There's still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public.\nFollow CNN Health on\n Facebook\n and \nTwitter\n.", "Thanks to mastodons, we still have this": "Believe it or not, it's not your grandmother nor is it Martha Stewart who had the most influence on this part of your traditional celebration.

The really wild version of these baseball-sized plants were a bit like your great Uncle Bill after a few holiday martinis. \n\"They were small, tough and bitter,\" author \nLogan Kistler \nsaid.\nLindsay Wyatt, a plant breeder who did not work on the study, but who grew some of these ancient  gourds a few years ago, said they were definitely not fit for your holiday menu (unless you didn't really like your guests?). \n\"I had to smash them open with a cinder block to get the seeds out, you could crush them pretty easily but they were not knife friendly,\" Wyatt said. \"They were also so bitter that even after I washed my hands after handling them, when I'd eat my lunch later in the day it made the lunch taste funny.\"  \nBitter and hard was not a problem for the megafauna of the era, according to the study.  The mastodons and giant sloths were strong enough to get through the tough skin. The authors say the large animals had fewer copies of the bitter tasting gene, meaning to them it wasn't toxic as it was for smaller animals.  These large animals actually encouraged wild gourds to grow, grazing so much there was room for these plants. Unable to digest the seeds, the animals would spread the seeds around as they traveled and essentially pooped in different places.  \nRelated: Ancient ancestors may have slept better than you\nAs these animals \nstarted to disappear\n, these wild gourds did, too. What saved the gourd then from extinction were ancient farmers. Our ancestors didn't mind the tough skin, as gourds could be used to carry liquid in those pre-pottery days. Fisherman also used them to keep their nets afloat. But they had to do something about the taste. So farmers must have cultivated the gourds that weren't as bitter.\nThe growing tradition carries on today. \"What we grow changes with personal taste and fads and viability, this is not a static discipline; this is a constant evolutionary process with plants,\" Kistler said.\nWyatt, who works for \nJohnny's Selected Seeds\n in Winslow, Maine, said even in the last few years market appetite has shaped the variety of gourds. \n\"I think this is in part because of the Pinterest side of things,\" Wyatt said, meaning people want to take pictures of a wider variety of seasonal gourds. \"But also with the growing interest in locally grown fruit and vegetables, there is a much wider appreciation of culinary quality these days.\" \nHer company does what our ancestors did, although the gourds our \nancestors grew \nwould likely taste different from the ones Americans like today. Growing fruits and vegetables \"is a continual process of improvement,\" she said.  And tastes vary.  Americans like sweeter gourds.  Some Asian cultures prefer more neutral tasting gourds with a heavier starch quality that holds up well in cooking.\nRelated: When famous people are 'pumpkin-ized'\nDaniel Sandweiss, \na professor of anthropology and climate studies at the University of Maine, said he appreciated this PNAS study as a reminder of the impact even a tiny population like these ancient ancestors could have on what's on our table thousands of years later.\n\"Humans have such a large and sometimes unexpected influence on economies and ecosystems,\" Sandweiss said. \"The squash we have today are remaining representatives of this genus of plant which otherwise would have been in trouble for survival because of the changing landscape.\"\n\"It's fascinating to think what impact human intervention can have even through the depth of time,\" Sandweiss said.\nClimate change, a new technology, your decision to try a different pumpkin pie recipe -- all of these factors could change food tradition for thousands of years to come.  If that's too much pressure to think about this holiday, maybe you should consider another current Thanksgiving tradition \nthat has evolved\n over thousands of years of heavy meals -- a nice, long after-dinner nap.", "How to optimize your lunchtime workout": "Smart planning and a few little tweaks can help you make the most of your lunchtime sweat session, says celebrity trainer and certified strength and conditioning specialist Holly Perkins. Shave minutes off of your midday routine with these helpful hacks.\nPlan your outfit accordingly\nDon't waste any time getting tangled in your blouse in the locker room or bathroom stall. Instead, find a way to wear some of your gym clothes to the office (a non-issue for us Health staffers, honestly). \"The easiest item is the sports bra, of course,\" says Perkins. \"That's something you automatically have to change anyways and it's a pain in the butt. So wear it, work out in it, get sweaty, then put your fresh bra on.\"\nTake the trick a few steps further by layering a blazer over a black sweat-wicking tee and your sports bra. Or, wear a sleek pair of black leggings with a long sweater, with a sports bra or fitted tank hiding underneath. Just have clean clothes packed in your bag to change into when you're done. \nBe strategic about hair and makeup\nLike your outfit, you should also plan your 'do. On days you want to workout midday, pull your locks into a high ponytail, braid, or top knot before you leave the house. Make sure your updo is tight enough that you won't have to fiddle with it again before hitting the treadmill.\nIf you can, go super light on your makeup so you don't have to worry about spending too much time taking it off before you start exercising, recommends Mona Gohara, MD, a dermatologist at the Yale School of Medicine.\nPack your own lunch\nWaiting in line for an (overpriced) salad wastes time when you're up against the clock. \"It feels better anyway to nourish yourself afterward with something clean and homemade,\" says Perkins.\nIf you plan on doing cardio, pack a post-workout pick-me-up balanced with carbs and protein and eat it (at your desk) within 20 to 30 minutes of wrapping to keep your energy up and your metabolism humming. If you strength trained, try to have about 20 grams of protein within an hour of finishing your workout to help repair your muscles and keep you full for the rest of the day.\nRELATED:  6 Low-Impact Workouts That Burn the Most Calories\nAvoid peak lunch hour\n\"There are certainly busier times at public gyms, lunch being a big one,\" says Perkins. If you find yourself always waiting for a machine or lining up for the showers around noon or 1 p.m., exercise a little earlier or a little late. Plan a snack accordingly so you're never too full or too hungry to get in a good workout if you do adjust your schedule. Or, avoid gym crowds entirely and go outside for a run or brisk walk. \nGo in with a plan\nShowing up to the gym without a plan means you'll wander the floor deciding what to do, wasting precious minutes in the process. What's more, you may end up doing a workout that won't help you achieve your end goal. \nPerkins recommends asking yourself a couple questions before you even leave your desk: Am I just looking to burn the most calories in the least amount of time? Or do I have a larger goal I need to work toward? \" Here's an example: \"If a client tells me her goal is to put on lean muscle mass, but aside from seeing me once a week, she's mostly spinning on her lunch breaks because it's convenient, she will have trouble achieving that goal,\" explains Perkins. \"An overall strength training workout is something you could definitely fit into a lunch period, but you may need to forgo some spin classes in order to meet your goal.\"\nPerkins advises spending some time on Sunday pre-planning your workouts for the week. Mark the days on your calendar you expect to fit in exercise over lunch, as well as any days you don't plan to work out. You should also write some notes (in a planner, on Post-Its, in your iCal, wherever) about the type of workout you plan to do\u2014and why.\nJust remember, as convenient as lunch workouts may be, there are some goals that may not be achievable solely in these shorter sessions (marathon training, anyone?). Coordinate wisely and be flexible about carving out time before and after work when necessary.\nRELATED: 20 Tricks to Stay Slim Without Thinking About It\nWhen in doubt, HIIT it hard\nIf you just want crank up the calorie burn fast and hard so you can get your workout done and move on with your day, then high-intensity interval training is the winning workout for you.\n\"Hop on the elliptical or treadmill and follow a protocol where, for a certain number of minutes, you go at a high intensity and then you go at a low intensity,\" Perkins says. \"You can use a similar structure with a strength training workout\u2014HIT, or just high-intensity training, meaning that the strength set itself is intense and you're heart rate comes down while you rest in between.\" (Hint: If you don't want to get too sweaty, strength may be the better route.)\nFor a simple HIIT or HIT program, follow Perkins' 2-minute rule: Go hard for 2 minutes and lighten up the intensity for 2 minutes for the duration of your sweat session. \"During the 2 minutes on the high-intensity interval, you can't go all out because you're going to burn out,\" Perkins warns. \"Think of a scale from one to 10, where one is you're falling asleep at the end of the night and 10 is as if I made you sprint as fast as humanly possible for a few miles\u2014you want to be at an eight for the full 2 minutes.\" (Still feeling unsure about what to do? \nThis HIIT Workout Gets the Job Done in 10 Minutes\n.)\nShorten (or skip) the warm-up\nA warm-up isn't necessary when you're just doing cardio, says Perkins. \"Technically all a warm-up is to prepare you metabolically for a workout,\" she explains. \"So if you're doing an interval-type cardio workout, you can pretty much just jump in and start with your 2 minutes of low intensity.\"\nSuiting up for strength? In that case, warming up will help you prevent injuries, Perkins says: \"If your session is going to include traditional strength training, you do want to start out with about 5 minutes on a stationary bike or walking on the treadmill,\" she says. Save even more time by jogging from your office to the gym. \nSave your deep stretch\nDon't sweat it if you don't have time to stretch after your lunch workout, Perkins says. \"But in a given week, you should carve out a substantial period of time for a deeper stretch period. So if on your lunch break you don't have a lot of time to fit it in, choose another day.\"\nThat doesn't mean you should jump off the treadmill and go right back to your desk. \"There should be a little bit of a cool-down in some capacity, even if it's 1 or 2 minutes on the floor performing just a couple of quick range of motion exercises,\" Perkins adds, like gentle leg swings, arm circles, and moving your neck side to side and back and forth.\nRELATED: The Best Post-Workout Stretches\nShorten your shower\nPrioritize scrubbing away the sweat and germs, says Dr. Gohara, and not so much cleansing your hair. In fact, you can skip washing it in the afternoon and just shampoo later in the evening. Invest in a wide headband or a reusable shower cap to keep your hair from getting wet. Another hack: If your gym locker room has plastic bags for sweaty clothes, you can use one to cover your mane and secure it with a tie or jaw clip.\n...or don't shower at all\nYes, it's OK to skip the full-body washdown if you're crunched for time, says Dr. Gohara. \"You should always cleanse your face, but it's fine if you can't take a real shower immediately,\" she says. Have makeup and body wipes on hand to towel away sweat on your face, neck, and the reachable areas on your back and shoulders, where some folks are prone to \"bacne,\" she adds. (And don't forget to bring a change of underwear.)\nWorried about spreading stink? Don't, says Perkins. \"You really don't have to shower again. You're not going to stink. And even if you do stink, no one is going to smell you. Do not waste your time showering for other peoples' sakes.\"\nStock your gym bag with your favorite deodorant and rollerball perfume and you're set.\nSkip the full blow dry\nWear a slightly sweaty ponytail and dry shampoo as a badge of honor, says Perkins. \"I do it all the time. If I've had a really good workout and my hair is sweaty, I just grab the hair dryer and only dry the sweat around my roots and the nape of my neck,\" she says. \"A little dry shampoo and a quick fluff with a brush, that's all you need.\"\nDr. Gohara also advises drying around your hairline as best as possible in the time you have if you're prone to breaking out in that area.\nThis article originally appeared on \nHealth.com\n. ", "Football's dangers, illustrated by one young man's brain": "Despite the fact that Keck, 25, never played professional football, he was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the Alzheimer's-like disease that also claimed the likes of former Chicago Bears safety \nDave Duerson\n and former San Diego Chargers linebacker \nJunior Seau\n, and with equal severity.\n\"I was surprised how extensive it was,\" said \nDr. Ann McKee\n,  professor of neurology and pathology at Boston University. She and her team have evaluated 170 brains to understand the pathology of CTE. The telltale sign of the disease is tangles of the protein tau, which takes over parts of the brain. They result from repeated hits to the head.\n\"I have never seen this (brain) pathology in someone under the age of 30\", she said. McKee and her team's findings were published in \nJAMA Neurology\n.\nKeck suffered more than 10 concussions\nKeck began playing football at 6. In his 16 years of playing, he had more than 10 concussions, the first when he was 8. Not once did he go to the hospital for treatment. \nThe star high school player was also a good student. He had a 3.8 GPA and was offered football scholarships to Alabama, Michigan and Southern California, according to the \nKansas City Star\n. He spent his freshman year at the University of Missouri and then transferred to Missouri State. \nDuring his freshman year at University of Missouri, he suffered a concussion on the field. He lost consciousness, suffered headaches, neck pain, insomnia and anxiety. He couldn't remember things or concentrate.\nKeck was allowed to return to play a few days afterward but the symptoms persisted. He eventually saw a neurologist, who prescribed him a muscle relaxant and anti-seizure medication, but they did little and the symptoms continued. By the beginning of his junior season at Missouri State, he stopped playing football because the symptoms were so strong. \nKeck was also suffering at school, the once star student now had a 1.9 GPA, and he eventually dropped out of school, 12 credits shy of graduating with his bachelor's degree. \nHis wife, \nCassandra Keck\n, told \nCNN affiliate KCTV\n, \"he had great opportunities, and he had to turn these opportunities down because of something that was taking over his brain.\" \nHe became increasingly depressed and suicidal. He couldn't keep a job and started using marijuana daily to deal with his headaches and anxiety. In addition, he became increasingly abusive toward Cassandra, verbally and physically, despite becoming increasingly dependent on her.  \n\"It went to where he would punch holes in the walls or throw something,\" said Cassandra. \n'I want my brain donated' \nKeck believed he suffered from CTE, but it cannot be diagnosed in living people. \n\"He was like, 'You know, no one believes I have this disease,' but he believed he did and I believed him and so he told me, he's like, 'If I ever die, I want my brain donated to Boston University,' \" said Cassandra. \nKeck died from cardiac arrest in 2013, and it does appear his life was lost to CTE.\nThe devastating disease has been found in athletes as young as \n17\n. \nOwen Thomas,\n a football player from the University of Pennsylvania who had CTE, took his own life at 21. Keck was unique because of how extensively his brain had been taken over by lesions of tau. \nMcKee and her team have discovered CTE in the brains of 44 out of 55 college football players. \"To find it in 44 players suggests that it isn't a rare condition, just a condition that we didn't look for before.\"\nIn addition, behavioral symptoms of the disease usually don't appear for quite some time said McKee. \"Usually there's a latent period. He seemed to develop it while he was playing. Even after he quit playing, it seemed to get worse.\" \nWho develops CTE still a mystery\nBut there's much to still learn about this disease. McKee said it is still unclear what makes some players develop this disease and others not; factors such as environment and genetics may have a role. \"These may be factors that influence the development. We don't know.\"\nBut McKee points to the fact that despite not having played in the professional league, Keck played for a long time. \"He started at age 6, he still played 16 years. That's lengthy.\" She added that age of first exposure to these kind of hits may lead to greater cognitive consequences.\n\"I think its becoming more and more clear that the developing brain is more susceptible to concussion; it has a delayed recovery from concussion,\" said McKee. \nHow can we keep players safe? \nMore and more experts have called to limit contact sports among young children. \"We really need to limit the amount of head contact that young children and adolescents are experiencing,\" said McKee. \nWhile some experts such as \nDr. Robert Cantu\n of Boston University have said children younger than 14 should not be allowed to play tackle football, others such as neurosurgeon \nDr. Julian Bailes\n said what is most effective to keep kids safe is to teach proper technique. Bailes is medical director of Pop Warner football. \"We are taking out unnecessary head contact out of the sport, out of practice. We're enforcing rule changes,\" said Bailes. In addition, Bailes, who is chairman of neurosurgery at NorthShore University HealthSystem, points out that Keck is just one of a handful of severe cases in younger players. \nWhile debate continues about how to make the game safer, McKee says accounting for cases such as Keck's is important. \n\"I just want to make sports safe for our kids.\" ", "Life lessons for 2016 from Sarah Silverman": "You know who she is even though it might be hard to pinpoint what for. Maybe it's from her stand-up, in which she broaches taboo topics such as rape and racism with \nwhat one comedian called\n a \"quiet depravity.\"\nOr, maybe you recognize her from her appearances on just about every comedy show that mattered in the last two decades, from \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Larry Sanders Show\" to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" \"Mr. Show with Bob and David\" and \"Chapelle's Show.\" She even had her own Comedy Central show, \"The Sarah Silverman Program\" from 2007 to 2010, which received a Primetime Emmy nomination.\nThe last few years she's shown her serious side through political activism and roles in independent films. She received a \n2016 Screen Actor's Guild Award\n nomination for \"I Smile Back,\" in which she plays a mother struggling with depression.\nShe's learned a thing or two from all that living, and she's been dispensing wisdom in recent media appearances to promote her film. Here's a smattering of what she has to say about depression, body image and the \"vagina tax\" women pay in comedy and other realms of society.\nLook in the mirror less\nSure, it's necessary to check yourself before leaving the house, and many people can't avoid paying attention to their appearance for their jobs. That doesn't change the fact that looking in the mirror can provoke anxiety for many. \nSilverman projects this anxiety in a scene in \"I Smile Back\" in which she gazes in the mirror and lifts her arms to see how her breasts would look at a higher position.\nRepeated references in news articles to her \"coltish\" beauty and slender figure notwithstanding, \nSilverman told NPR's Terry Gross\n that she still experiences insecurity over her body. To keep it at bay she follows this brilliant piece of advice from her therapist: Look in the mirror less.\n\"It really blew my mind in the greatest way,\" she said. \"And I just thought, 'oh, right.'\n\"I always look at myself knowing that I will have a certain degree of cognitive distortion ... so I put it on a bell curve. I kind of adjust what I'm seeing and know that it's better than what I'm seeing, whether that's true or not.\"\nTalk about taboo topics \nComedians often crack jokes that make people uncomfortable and stir controversy, as Silverman knows well. (See her \nher 2001 appearance on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\n.\")\nThere have been other times when Silverman used comedy to address social injustices and instances of inequality. In a 2014 viral video, she \nparodied the wage gap\n between men and women in the United States, calling it a \"vagina tax.\" \n\"Comedy has always played a big part in pop culture and the way we see history. It's more of a mirror to society and more of an honest reflection of history than history, sometimes,\" Silverman told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \nFor example, there was a time when the transgender community was rarely acknowledged, she said. What's changed over time is people started talking about the community and its experiences, she said.\n\"If you look at all things that were at one time taboo and aren't anymore, the change is that it became a topic of discussion,\" she said.\n\"If you look at the trans community, these people always existed; they just were living in personal hells where they couldn't expose themselves,\" she said. \"What it took was -- and it continues to take -- is that it just becomes part of a conversation and then it's not so crazy anymore.\"\n... And depression is one of those topics\nWhen it comes to dealing with depression and anxiety, Silverman is fond of quoting Mister Rogers, who \nonce said\n, \"Whatever is mentionable can be more manageable.\"\nIt's something she learned over time coping with depression, starting when she was a teenager in New Hampshire. She has several ways of describing depression and how it's different from grief or sadness. To her, it's an instant \"chemical change,\" like a \"cloud covering the sun\" or a sudden onset of the flu.\n\"My perspective of the world changed about three degrees, and everything I saw was different,\" she told NPR's \"Fresh Air.\" \"I had been an extremely social person with best friends and the class clown. And all of that meant nothing, suddenly. I didn't see any reason -- being with friends felt like a burden.\"\nShe was initially prescribed four Xanax four times a day. She said she found a new psychologist and eventually stabilized after tapering off her medication. She channeled those experiences into playing her character, Laney, in \"I Smile Back.\" \n\"She really lives entirely in anxiety, in that state we all get in occasionally of 'what if?'\" she told Amanpour. \"We tell ourselves horror stories and that's anxiety... and there's no space for anything else.\"\nBut treatment is a lifelong process -- a commitment, even -- of adjusting medication if need be and finding the right person to talk to.\n\"We drive every kind of car before we pick a car. Plan on seeing 12 different therapists before you find one. It's important,\" \nshe told James Lipton\n, host of \"Inside the Actor's Studio.\"\n\"People say I can't afford therapy. Get a shittier car -- it's important.\"\nYou can't have the highs without the lows\nEven if you take your medication and regularly visit a therapist, the mood swings never go away, Silverman said. But you learn how to manage them.\nSilverman started experiencing panic attacks as an adult after she started working as a writer at \"Saturday Night Live.\" \n\"I remember thinking I want to move home to New Hampshire. ... You just want to go home, and you don't want to do anything scary. And then I found a woman who put me on a pill called Klonopin that all it does is block panic attacks. And that really saved my life in that I was able to go to work at 'Saturday Night Live' and exist through each day while I was figuring this out,\" she told NPR.\nSilverman said she has been on a low dose of Zoloft since 1994, what she calls a \"godsend.\" It doesn't make her numb but it helps keep panic at bay. \n\"It was the perfect fit for me, and I feel like I can live life,\" she told NPR. \"It wasn't something where, like, now I'm happy. I'm very lucky in that I still experience highs and lows. And I think those lows are important. But I am not totally paralyzed, and, you know, it keeps me from just complete staid paralysis.\"\nIt's OK to tell girl jokes\nWhen Silverman started in comedy the men around her held up Paula Poundstone as the exemplar female comedian because any man could take her material and be just as funny, she told NPR.\n\"She's not talking about tampons and stuff,\" she said. \"And I really took that as truth. I just accepted it as the way things were and that that was cool.\"\nOver time, she came to see the value in sharing her experiences. And she found an audience for them. \"Comedy is talking about my own experience, and I'm a woman. And that's my experience. And just because it isn't yours doesn't invalidate it.\" \nEmbrace the quiet moments\nFrom comedian Gary Shandling, who gave Silverman a shot on his popular HBO 1990s comedy, \"The Larry Sanders Show,\" Silverman learned not to fear the quiet moment.\nThe context for Silverman was onstage, but it's a skill that could apply in everyday life.\n\"He really taught me to find comfort in the quiet moments,\" she told \"Inside the Actor's Studio.\" \"The moments between the jokes, the setup, the punchline ... can be just as powerful and say just as much as words.\"", "The most popular baby names of 2015": "For the \nsecond year in a row\n, they are the most popular baby names in the United States, \naccording to the Social Security Administration\n. 2015 is actually the third consecutive year at the top for Noah. \nWe said our farewells to other perennial favorites -- Daniel for boys and Madison for girls -- as two new baby names reached the Top 10: Benjamin for boys and Harper for girls. This is the first time either name has cracked the list of most popular names.\nThe lists for boys and girls haven't changed much, with only a few shifts up and down. Perhaps Charlotte, a newcomer to the list last year, is a more popular name after the birth of British royal baby \nPrincess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana\n in May 2015. James and Michael also swapped places, with the former growing in popularity. \nThe boy names are a mix of classics and nods to popular actors and pop culture. The name Liam has steadily been on the rise in the top 10 since 2012, when the first \"Hunger Games\" film, starring Liam Hemsworth, premiered. \nThe Social Security Administration is able to share the ranking because parents provide the names of children when they apply for Social Security cards. The agency started releasing its popular baby name list by gender in 1997 but has \ncollected names dating back to 1880\n. \nBeyond the top 10, less-traditional names are also on the rise. For girls, Alaia spiked from No. 2,676 in 2014 to No. 664 in 2015. Perhaps this can be traced to Alaia Baldwin, a model and the daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin, or fashion designer Azzedine Alaia, the Social Security Administration noted.\nMeilani, Adaline and Zelda are also growing in popularity. Meilani is the name of Jersey Shore star Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley's daughter, born in 2014, as well as the middle name of \n\"Soul Surfer\" and shark attack survivor Bethany Hamilton\n. Adaline was Blake Lively's character in the 2015 film \"The Age of Adaline,\" and Zelda could be attributed either to popular video game \"The Legend of Zelda\" or to continued fascination with writer Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald.\nFor boys, the name Riaan jumped from No. 2,286 to No. 926. This name is connected with the son of popular Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh. Huxley, Omari and Jabari are also rising on the list of popular names. Omari Hardwick is an actor who has appeared on the shows \"Power\" and \"Being Mary Jane,\" while Jabari Parker plays basketball for the Milwaukee Bucks. \nAs for Huxley, the agency is stumped, questioning whether \"Brave New World\" author Aldous Huxley is receiving renewed attention.\nMost popular names for girls in 2015: \n1.

Smells like rotten apples\nSeveral diseases have been discovered to harbor signature scents on the body in recent studies, including people with typhoid fever reported to smell like baked bread, people with yellow fever smelling like a butcher's shop and the glandular disease scrofula leaving people smelling like stale beer -- subtle scents picked up most likely by a trained nose.\nA more common disease with a trademark odor is diabetes, which is described as having notes of rotten apples, caused by low concentrations of acetone released on the breath. The change is subtle, however, and more easily picked up by a trained nose, such as that of George Preti, an organic chemist at the \nMonell Chemical Senses Center.\nPreti has been studying body odor for more than 30 years.\"I ride public transport a lot, and every now and then, I come across someone emanating a strong odor, and it's obvious,\" Preti said.\nOlsson's team set out on a more general challenge: to explore how odors can reveal when someone is sick, or recently infected. The process is thought to be evolutionary among humans who sense the change and steer clear -- to stay healthy.\n\"People should be able to detect when someone is contagious,\" said Olsson, who sniffed out the truth in a recent \nstudy\n.\nSmelling the sick\nThe team injected human volunteers with lipopolysaccaharide, a compound known to activate the innate immune system and inflammatory responses in humans as if they were fighting bacteria. \nBy injecting eight volunteers with either the compound or a placebo, bodies were made to behave either as if they were sick or healthy. Body odors were then collected from the armpits of t-shirts worn by volunteers, ready for inspection by a panel of judges whose noses were trained for the occasion.\nThe odors were sniffed by a panel of 40, who described their intensity and pleasantness. The odors stemming from bodies that had begun to behave as if they were sick were found to smell more aversive, proving that disease smells.\n\"This was the first experimental study to show that when you're sick, you smell differently,\" Olsson said.\nIn this instance, the change in smells didn't distinguish between diseases but was instead a warning light -- or smell -- that someone was unwell as their immune system was active.\nThe benefits of disgust\nSince the study in 2014, Olsson has been exploring the doses at which these odors can be picked up as well as the body's response to unpleasant smells. \nIn more recent studies, he found that the disgust felt by people when smelling unpleasant odors activated a mild immune reaction of their own, to protect them further from disease.\nOlsson tested immune reactions in people exposed to a range disgusting smells -- including cheese, fermented fish and rotten yeast -- and found slight increases immune activity.  People's bodies were gearing up for attack. \n\"Emotional disgust is there to keep us healthy,\" Olsson said.\nAlternative scents\nOlsson has also been exploring other sources of telltale smells -- including urine -- and the team's next target is breath, which is harder to sample and expose people to.\n\"We saw this inflammation process affected the smell of urine as well, and breath is a good indicator of some diseases,\" Olsson said.\nBut Preti warns that when working with more metabolic odors, such as those in urine and breath, there are many other factors that come into play aside from immune activity. \"These can be affected by your diet or you body's microbiome. ... This will make it harder to diagnose the situation,\"  Preti said.\nRead more from Vital Signs", "Experimenting with death to save their lives": "They are wide awake and very much alive, but they're attending their own funerals.\nFrench photographer \nFran\u00e7oise Huguier\n photographed them this year at the Hyowon Healing Center in Seoul, South Korea. It's where groups of people who might be struggling with depression, stress or suicidal thoughts go to act out their own funerals. There isn't any additional mental health treatment around the funerals, Huguier said, but participants told her they believe it could make them feel better.\nSouth Korea has the \nhighest suicide rate\n among the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. For young people, especially, there's pressure to ace schoolwork and exams to land a good job at a big company, Huguier said. \nPeople she met came to the center on their own or because their doctors recommended it. They, like the center's founders, believe it offers an \"experimental death in order to better appreciate life.\" \nAfter participants arrive, their portraits are taken in the same style as photos found on the coffins of dead people, Huguier said. There's a speech about suicide and an emotional film, then participants dress in a funeral costume. They write their farewells and read them before the group.\nThen they get into coffins as lights are lowered. The lids are closed, and it stays that way for 10 long, quiet minutes.\nWhen the coffins were reopened, the reactions varied, Huguier said. Some people cried from claustrophobia; others were asleep. Some seemed lighter and happier. Some took selfies.\n\"The head of the center tells them: 'Now you know what death looks like. You are alive. Fight for Korea,' \" Huguier said.\nThis is a uniquely South Korean experience, she said. Other places have different relationships with death. Anywhere else, \"You would go to a psychologist, but you wouldn't live this experience,\" Huguier said. It works because they're in a group, sharing the experience, she said. Otherwise, a person who laid down in a coffin \"would look like a mad person.\" \nHuguier said she doesn't believe the experience will reduce suicides; it felt to her like a business designed to make money. But it could help those who believe in it, she said.\n\"People I met told me it helped them to feel better,\" Huguier said. \"They do believe this is an answer, but I don't.\"", "Quiz: How healthy is your diet?": "", "Stopping gun homicides by paying kids not to kill": "They're relaxing in the lobby of a city agency, one outfitted with a couch and wing chairs to make it feel homey. Anything to provide relief from the hard streets of Richmond, California, once known as one of the most violent cities in America.\n\"What can I do better?\" the mentor, Kevin Yarbrough, asks.\n\"Help us get out of Richmond and stuff,\" one teen mumbles. \"Get us far away.\"\nThe conversation sounds like one any mentor might have with a group of inner-city teens in America. \nBut this is no ordinary group. The mentor is an ex-con working for the city. The teens are suspected of the worst types of crimes but haven't faced prosecution, for lack of evidence. The mentor's job: Get them to put down their guns, stop their violent ways and transform their lives beyond the streets.\n\"They're babies growing up in a war zone,\" says DeVone Boggan. \"But the police would tell you they're killers. 'Serial killer' is what a police officer might call some of these young men, because of what they're suspected of doing.\"\nBoggan helped found the innovative city agency, the Office of Neighborhood Safety or ONS, in the fall of 2007 after gun violence spiraled out of control in Richmond, a city of about 100,000 just north of Berkeley.\nFueled by gang violence, neighborhood rivalries and large-scale unemployment among black youth, the violence led to 47 homicides in Richmond in 2007 -- a record for the city and a rate more than eight times the national average. \nBy comparison, Oakland saw 30 killings per 100,000 residents that year; Chicago had nearly 16 per 100,000.  \nA drastic approach was needed to turn the tide. There was so much violence, the city even considered bringing in the National Guard to restore calm.\nThe next year, Boggan saw the killings drop to 27 -- a 40% decline -- as he began his strategy of hiring reformed ex-cons and sending them into the most violent neighborhoods to keep the peace. \nBut those gains were followed in 2009 by another spike of 47 killings. They had put too much emphasis on \"hot spots\" and not enough on individuals. \n\"We learned that focusing on hot spots [is] important, but they're not more important than hot people,\" Boggan says. \"Why? Because hot people make hot spots.\"\nAnd so Operation Peacemaker was born. Loosely based on an academic fellowship, the ONS program invites some of the most hardened youth into the fold: often teenage boys suspected of violent crimes but whom authorities don't have enough evidence to charge criminally. \nThese fellows must pledge to put their guns away for a more peaceful life. They are hooked up with mentors -- the reformed criminals-turned-city workers -- who offer advice, guidance and support to get jobs. If the fellows show good behavior after six months, they can earn a stipend of up to $1,000 a month.  \nSince the fellowship started, the city has seen dramatic results, including a low of 11 gun homicides in 2014 -- the fewest number of people killed in Richmond in four decades. \nThe program has caught the attention of cities hoping to model programs with similar success, from Sacramento, California, to Toledo, Ohio, to Washington.\nIn the media, the fellowship is often dubbed \"cash for criminals,\" which makes Boggan's eyes roll. He laughs because, although it's true, the program is so much more. And it's predicated on the most basic of human elements: \"We harass them with love and kindness.\"\nTo understand the hardships these young men face, he says, you must know that each has had family members, friends and neighbors killed -- that it's not uncommon for a 15-year-old to have known a dozen people killed in his young life. \n\"You grow up with that experience,\" he says, \"and it creates a great deal of hostility, anger, untreated vicarious trauma in your life.\"\nOf the four teens discussing job possibilities with their mentor, Yarborough, when CNN visited, one's mother died when he was a young boy; another had a brother killed. Two are already fathers. \nThe way it works\nThe ONS relies on Yarborough and five other mentors, known as \"neighborhood change agents,\" to keep the pulse of hot-spot neighborhoods and the fellows within their program. The mentors, along with a few other part-time workers involved with street outreach, monitor police scanners for shootings and have neighborhood contacts who let them know when they sense that something bad is about to happen.\n\"Like if something's going down,\" says Yarborough, \"somebody will call me and be like: It ain't cool.\"\nHe then touches base with his fellows to make sure they're alive and confirm that they haven't returned to their old ways. \nThe mentors, Boggan says, are not naive: They've all served time in local or federal facilities for some type of gun offense. One served 18 years in San Quentin State Prison for second-degree murder. \n\"It's been cool knowing that I got some back-up help,\" says T.K. Sykes, one of the fellows being mentored by Yarborough. \"There's a lot of stuff they've been through that I don't want to go through. I'm glad they get to share those kinds of situations with me.\"\nA graduate of UC Berkeley, Boggan began his career in Oakland with Safe Passages, which works to break the cycle of violence through an array of programs. \nWhen he moved his work to nearby Richmond, he says, he \"decided to dedicate my life to reducing gun violence.\"  The Office of Neighborhood Safety, he says, was formed solely \"to reduce violent assaults and associated deaths.\" \nBoggan studied and borrowed from other programs, most notably one created by David Kennedy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.  \nKennedy's model, which has been implemented in dozens of cities, targets those individuals believed to be the most violent and brings them together for \"Call Ins.\"\nThose sessions are headed up by law enforcement, who issue \nstern warnings and threaten harsh punishment\n. Often, the people invited are on parole, and their attendance is mandatory.  \nBoggan focused his program not on parolees but on teens and young men known to be active in gun violence who've escaped doing serious time. And Boggan took law enforcement out of the equation. He wanted to shower these youth with positivity, not threats of prison. \n\"So many approaches to these young men are uninformed and don't take into account who these young men are and where they come from,\" he says. \nWith the distrust between the black community and police, Boggan adds, having police try to persuade young men to stop their ways is not a long-term solution. Scaring people might stop violence for a short period, he says, but it won't last. \nHis approach, Boggan admits, has led to \"healthy tensions\" between the ONS and local police.\n\"Our relationship with law enforcement is not perfect, but it gets better each day,\" he says. \"It's important that we not have an adversarial relationship but clear separation and respect of those necessary lines.\"\nRichmond Police Chief Allwyn Brown says his department welcomes all efforts to reduce gun violence. \n\"The police, the justice system can't do this whole thing,\" he said. \"There has to be multiple interventions. We get it.\"\nSince the program began, he said, more residents have come forward with information about shootings. That's led gang rivals to take their grievances -- and shootings -- out of neighborhoods and onto the city's interstates.\nStill, Brown credits the agency with helping young men who are involved in \"potential criminal activity\" and \"living outside the law\" with choosing an \"honest approach\" instead. \nBoggan believes the vast majority of youth in rough inner-city neighborhoods are inherently good and need to be exposed to new opportunities. With ex-felons as his change agents, he says, the teens are more likely to respond. \n\"That translates into trust on the street,\" Boggan says. \"And trust is a major commodity with what we do.\" \nAt one point, he employed seven full-time mentors, but cutbacks reduced his staff to four full-time and two part-time mentors. \n2015 saw gun homicides nearly double to 21, from the low of 11 in 2014. Boggan says staffing cuts may have played a role. \"Less people touched, and the people touched are not being touched as often,\" he says. \"That's certainly an impact.\"\nHow it started\nThe most controversial part of the program -- fellowships offering monthly stipends -- began after gun violence jumped in 2009. \nBoggan says he was sitting in a room with local, state and federal law enforcement discussing the root cause of the violence. They believed that 17 suspects were responsible for 70% of the 47 homicides that year.  \n\"I began to see just how simple the problem was, albeit tough work,\" Boggan says. \"If we could find our way towards those 17 people in a more focused, intentional, deliberate way, then change could happen.\"\nIt turned out the number was actually 28. He and his team of change agents put all of their efforts into reaching out to them within three months. He rolled out the red carpet, inviting them to meetings like he would anyone else he wanted to do business with. \nHis premise: \"This city will not be healthy unless these young men are healthy.\"\nThree of the 28 young men were killed before the ONS could even get to them. That left 25. Of those, 21 -- ranging in age from 16 to 26 -- showed up. Each was receptive to change.\nUnlike the \"Call Ins\" from the Kennedy model, the agency simply asks the youths to hear them out. It's part of showing them a form of respect. \"We have no authority to 'call in' anyone,\" Boggan says. \"We ask these young men to join us. We ask them to partner with us. We ask them into the family.\"\nThus, the fellowship began. Boggan describes the 18-month program as similar to most any post-graduate work, but this one is \"designed specifically for active firearm offenders who've avoided sustained criminal consequences.\" \nEach fellow commits to promoting peace in his community and to a life without guns. They get hooked up with jobs and anger-management experts. A life map is provided, detailing the barriers they face and what they must do to overcome them.\nSix months into the fellowships, the young men can apply for the monthly stipend, which can go up to $1,000 depending on their participation and achievements. Most earn about $300 to $750 a month. They can make money for up to nine months. \nHe bristles when asked whether it's a good idea to use tax dollars to pay people to stop committing violence. \"That's nothing compared to the cost of gun violence in this city,\" Boggan says.\nDuring the fellowships, the young men meet with mothers whose children were killed by gun violence. They visit colleges and meet business leaders. With the help of private donations, they've traveled to places like the nation's capital and Chicago, as well as outside the country to spots in Mexico and South Africa. \nGang rivals get paired on trips so they can talk with one another and see each other as human beings. \"To share their stories,\" Boggan says, \"is part of the healing process for these young men.\"\nA total of 68 fellows -- \"the most lethal young men most likely to be killed in our city\" -- have been through the program since June 2010. Ninety-four percent are still alive, and 79% have not been suspected of a new gun crime, Boggan says. Of the other 21%, one has been convicted of a gun homicide, 12 have been convicted of firearm possession, and eight have been suspects in shootings.\nSome fellows who successfully complete the program are allowed to reapply for another 18 months. Most move on into the world. \"They are no longer the person we met on Day 1 of the fellowship.\" \nEven after they leave, the ONS stays in contact with them, if for no other reason than to lend support when they might struggle. \nThe city has experienced a 76% reduction in gun homicides since the fellowship began in 2009, the agency says. The program can't take all of the credit for the reduced crime, Boggan says; police work and an improved economy also play a part. \nBut he adds, \"I would give the credit to the young men. When you actually focus on the very people involved in gun violence, I think you can't argue that they're not contributing to the safer environment happening in this city.\"\nBoggan recently stepped down as ONS director to form a nonprofit organization called Advance Peace. He remains contracted with the city of Richmond to help advise the office but will also work with other cities to build pilot programs similar to the one started here. \nHis life mission is to provide hope to troubled youth to \"change the reality ... of this epidemic facing our nation.\"\n\"America's gun violence,\" he says, \"is a national disgrace. We should be ashamed of ourselves.\"\nHe will keep pushing for change. ", "Dr. robot could conduct your next surgery": "One step up the technological spectrum is \nartificial intelligence\n, where robots are now making informed decisions based on the tasks they're presented with, highlighted by the burgeoning field of \ndriverless cars\n.\nAs we get used to the idea of machines producing our goods, we're slowly coming around to them making decisions for us, but would you put your life in their hands? More specifically, would you let a robot perform surgery on you? \nChina restaurant debuts robot waiters\nBetter than a human surgeon\nThe idea might scare you, but scientists are making it happen -- and doing it safely -- as shown in a \nrecent study\n by surgeons at \nChildren's National Medical Center\n in Washington.\nThe team showed for the first time that a supervised autonomous robot could perform soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel during open surgery -- and doing so better than a human surgeon.\n\"This smart, intelligent technology will tell you how to (conduct surgery) optimally,\" said Peter Kim, \nassociate surgeon in chief\n at the hospital and project lead on the Smart-Tissue Autonomous Robot, or STAR. \"This is not to replace surgeons tomorrow but provide collective experiences of how things should be done.\" \nKim argues that developing robots in this way can ensure all patients receive the best care, regardless of which surgeon is available when they are in need of it. \"Wouldn't it be nice that whenever or wherever you need surgery, it's done by the best surgeon?\" \nRobot vs. human\nThe use of robots to aid with surgeries is nothing new. Surgeons regularly use devices such as the \nda Vinci Surgical System\n to perform complex procedures, and the robots can help access hard-to-reach tumors or visualize the inside of a patient with minimal invasion. \nStep into operating room from wherever you are\nBut the use of robots purely as aids is what Kim is trying to move beyond. He wants them to outdo the surgeons.\n\"(Current) tools are simple extensions of a human. Unless you make them better, there's no point,\" said Kim, who believes that his robot can be developed to conduct routine parts of a procedure, freeing up surgeons to focus on more challenging aspects. \"The tool will come in at a time and place for maximal function.\"\nHow does it work?\nIn the study, STAR sutured and reconnected bowel segments in a selection of pigs. Results were compared to those of manual surgery, the use of laparoscopes and use of robot assistance with the da Vinci system. On all counts, such as quality and accuracy, STAR came out shining bright.\nThe machine is made up of a robotic arm and surgical tools that use imaging technologies and markers to navigate along  tissue. The visuals further help the robot decide where stitches should be made. \n\"The robot makes the decision of where sutures should go, based on vision and pressure,\" Kim said. \"The precision is within a sub-millimeter range.\"\nRobots are already used to work on hard tissues, such as bone, but the solid structure offers an easier, more stable target for the robot to cut into. Soft tissues are more challenging. \n\"Soft tissue constantly moves, so one major finding (of this) is that we can model soft tissue and follow it,\" Kim said.\nThe team hopes that using robots autonomously will remove human error from the operating room for the 45,000 soft-tissue surgeries estimated to take place in the United States each year. A \nrecent study \nsuggested that medical mistakes might be the \nthird leading cause of death\n in the country.\n\"With other robot technologies, complication rates haven't changed at all,\" Kim said. \niPhone photography is cool, eyeball photography is cooler\nAn ethical challenge\nOne critical question that remains is whether it would be acceptable for robots to be used autonomously in procedures where human life is at stake. \n\"There are ethical issues, such as where lies the responsibility if it is completely automated,\" said \nShafi Ahmed\n, a consultant cancer surgeon at the Royal London Hospital. \nWhen a surgeon should just say 'I'm sorry'\nAhmed is a proponent of the use of technology in surgery, exemplified through his recent \nlive stream of an operation\n in virtual reality, but acknowledges the risks involved in automating procedures.\n\"A surgeon can deal with a complication,\" he said, adding that the ability to adjust when a complication arises is one of the hardest parts of the job. \"Will a robot be able to deal with it?\"\nFor now, Ahmed believes that the use of autonomous robots in only part of an operation, with the surgeon present at all times, alleviates this dilemma. But he also questions why a robot is needed if a surgeon has to be in the room. \"These are the first steps,\" he said.\nThe study was a intended to show that STAR could be an option for surgery. Kim's team now hopes to take the robot into clinical trials and make it more intelligent, with the goal of automating an entire procedure.\n\"It's not a perfect technology. It does make mistakes,\" Kim said. \"But fundamentally, it (will be) safer and accessible to everybody.\"", "'I'm an abortion travel agent'": "One needs a bus from Texarkana to Shreveport, Louisiana. Another traveling from Corpus Christi to San Antonio has to find a hotel room. A third must get to Fort Worth from a small town in the western part of the state. A fourth reaches out from Lubbock to say she missed her appointment in Dallas.\nTo the stranger at a party who asks what she does, St. Clair keeps her answer vague: \"Just feminist stuff.\" But the truth is blunt, bold and a sign of the times: \"I'm an abortion travel agent.\" \nIt's a job that emerged after Texas enacted House Bill 2 in 2013, imposing a new round of restrictions on abortion care and abortion providers. Two key parts of the law have been challenged all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which \nhears arguments in \nWhole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n on Wednesday. \nIt has been called the biggest abortion case to face the high court in more than two decades and could have far-reaching effects depending on how justices rule.\nREAD: All eyes on Justice Kennedy as Supreme Court takes up abortion case\nIn Texas, the effects of HB2 have already been felt. Unable or unwilling to meet new requirements, clinics across the state have shut their doors. Before HB2, the state had more than 40 abortion clinics; now there are 13, according to St. Clair's latest count. Among the new rules: Doctors must have hospital privileges, and clinics must function like outpatient surgery centers.\nIn an enormous state that spans 270,000 square miles -- bigger than many countries -- some women are now living in an abortion desert. In Lubbock, for example, they have to travel nearly 300 miles to reach a provider. And the ripple effects don't stop there.\nThe farther a woman lives from a clinic, the more complicated it is to get there. Especially if she works more than one job, needs to secure child care or doesn't have a car or money for a hotel. Add to this the wait time to get an appointment, and another wait time after a legally required sonogram. In some clinics, it has taken as long as 23 days to get on the schedule since the passage of HB2, according to the \nTexas Policy Evaluation Project\n at the University of Texas.\nThe longer the wait to get an abortion, the more expensive -- and potentially more complicated -- the procedure. What could have cost hundreds of dollars easily jumps into the thousands. And if a woman is more than 20 weeks pregnant, she has waited too long to get an abortion in Texas. Under HB2, it's illegal in most cases -- and she'll have to travel out of state. \nEnter \nFund Texas Choice\n, where St. Clair, 23, works as the operations manager and is the organization's only full-time employee. While other \nfunds have helped pay for abortions for decades\n, this one answers a different call necessitated by HB2. It's for anyone who doesn't have a vehicle or must drive two hours or more on their own to reach a clinic. \nWorking out of an office in Austin, St. Clair often wires women gas money. (PayPal would be easier, but it requires a bank account, something many clients don't have.) In rural parts of Texas, just getting that wired money can require travel across multiple towns to reach a MoneyGram at Walmart. She books flights, taxis, bus tickets and hotel rooms. She regularly studies Greyhound routes and bookmarks airline schedules. Once she drove 3\u00bd hours one-way to hand deliver last-minute financial help. \nShe tells stories of women who offer to sleep in their cars. Hell will freeze over, she says, before she'll let that happen.\n\"By far these obstacles are greatest for low-income clients living in rural areas -- which are mostly populations of color,\" St. Clair says. And if they're not native English speakers, the hurdles are even higher. \nShe talks about the people who have had to miss appointments because their babysitters flaked or their paychecks didn't clear, and then couldn't afford a later procedure. \nThere was a woman who flew to Albuquerque, only to be blocked by protesters. By the time she got into the clinic, she'd missed her appointment and had to fly home. \nAnother young woman stood on a rural West Texas road waiting for a Greyhound bus that never showed. St. Clair scrambled to find a way to get her to her appointment the next day. A taxi would have cost $500, so instead she paid one of the client's friends to do the driving. The two arrived at 3 a.m., five hours before the appointment, only to find out she was further along than expected and couldn't afford the procedure that was required. \nI heard similar stories from one of St. Clair's allies in this work.\nThere was the woman with severe diabetes who knew it was unsafe for her to carry a baby. The first-generation American, the first in her family to go to college, who desperately wants kids someday -- but not now. The one whose abuser took off his condom and said, \"Now you belong to me.\" \nSt. Clair fields about 60 calls a month and manages about 20 abortion trips. While her focus is logistics, she's often a safe sounding board for clients. They thank her for not judging them. Some say they had no idea they could get pregnant. Others tell her about the men who hurt them. Then there are those who want to be reassured they're still Christian. \nHer hours are odd, usually at night, so she can be in touch with clients when they're off work. Most people like to text, in part so no one can hear their words.  \nShe works in a closed-down Whole Woman's Health clinic. Others who share the space are like-minded advocates: educators, counselors, spokeswomen. \nDown the hall from St. Clair, a reproductive rights policy wonk keeps a Kevlar vest on her bookshelf. It belonged to her late father, who was an abortion provider in South Texas. An FBI agent was assigned to him to monitor threats. The vest is her \"talisman,\" she says, \"a reminder of why I do what I do.\"\nThe dangers in this work are real. Over the years and across the country, abortion providers have been killed and clinics bombed. One need only think back to November, when a \nshooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic\n left three dead.\nBecause of this reality, St. Clair's eyes open wide when -- at night -- someone shows up outside the building and incessantly rings the doorbell. The entrance is hidden, a dark hallway outside provides cover, and there's no telling what, if anything, might have been left outside the door.\nShe reaches out to colleagues, who tell her to call the police immediately. She does. An hour and a half and four calls later, an officer shows up. \nOn this night, she has a visitor and officer to escort her to her car. On all other nights, she walks out into the darkness alone, holding a phone to her ear. She keeps a friend on the line, just in case something happens. \n'What do I do now?'\nNearly 400 miles to the northwest, Angela Martinez stands in front of the place she once thought would employ her forever. She was the clinic director at the Planned Parenthood Women's Health Center in her hometown of Lubbock.\nNow empty and undergoing renovation for new tenants, the facility shut down in October 2013, a casualty of HB2.\n\"We became an example of the assault on clinics. I was devastated,\" she says of the closure, which left her depressed for months and led her to move back in with her parents. \"I had this great job with amazing purpose, and it was gone.\"\nCollege students, addicts who don't believe they are fit to be mothers and women who already had children would pull into the parking lot. Martinez remembers them arriving in cabs, old jalopies and fancy SUVs \u2014 some even with McCain/Palin bumper stickers. Women who might rail against abortion in their social circles, she says, were happy to accept Planned Parenthood's services once they got pregnant.\nThey would say things like, \"I'm a good Christian or I don't believe in this, but my situation is different,\" Martinez says.\nShe never judged. She says she was just glad her clinic could provide them a choice, and a safe legal option to do what they thought was best for themselves and their families.\nThis overriding purpose drove her. Each week she'd pick up a doctor who flew in from out of town to perform procedures on Thursdays. He would arrive incognito, wearing a hat and sunglasses. He'd step into her car and fully recline his seat so no one could see him. \nMartinez could handle the anti-abortion activist who knocked on the door posing as a reporter and wrote down her license plate number. She dismissed the plea from one of her brothers that she get a license for a concealed handgun. She could tune out the screams: \"Angela Martinez, you're killing babies!\" \nWhen dozens of protesters gathered on the sidewalk and their shouts could be heard inside the clinic, she turned up a dinky radio to drown out the noise for patients -- and herself.\n\"My attitude was, 'I'm going to be fine.' I wanted my employees to be safe,\" she says. \"And I'd rather have a protester yell at me than at a patient.\"\nShe's now working on a graduate degree in social work at nearby Texas Tech University, but in many respects Martinez's heart remains in the past, and she still hopes she can one day return to her previous work.\nAlso in the past, at times, is Dorothy Boyett.\nFor two decades, every Thursday without fail, she stationed herself outside this Lubbock clinic. Starting at 6 a.m. and for the next eight hours -- rain or shine, snow, wind or heatwave -- she had a job to do.\nShe says she quietly prayed and passed out Bible tracts and pamphlets about baby development. It was her ministry to offer another way. A London native, Boyett is sweet, genteel, her English accent charming. \nThis born-again, 69-year-old grandmother of 15 sits at her kitchen table and says she still sometimes forgets on Wednesday nights that she has nowhere she has to be in the morning.\n\"We had worked for 20 years with that goal in mind,\" she says of the clinic's demise. \"So when they did close, it was euphoric. And then you think, well, what do I do now?\" \nIt's not that she's not keeping busy. An orthopedic nurse, she still works at a hospital once a week. Between that, her grandchildren, her evangelism on Texas Tech's campus, her Tuesdays passing out fliers on a Lubbock street corner, there's plenty to do. \nBut it's not the same as her mission outside that clinic, where she says she peacefully prayed for so many years.\nShe didn't always play by the rules, though, and admits, \"I've crossed the line from time to time\" -- meaning, she says, the property line. \nShe joined hands with Operation Rescue in Wichita, Kansas, where Dr. George Tiller -- later shot dead while in church -- was performing second trimester abortions. She helped block doors and says she's been arrested about a dozen times.\nFrom her large white Chevy van in her garage, she offers a brochure and hands over a tiny rubber baby, saying it represents what a baby looks like at 10 weeks in the womb. Leaning against the cargo van's inside wall: an oversized sign, featuring a gruesome image of an aborted fetus.\nA place next door\nHalf of all pregnancies in the United States are unintentional, according to a report in the American Journal of Public Health. And of those unplanned pregnancies, four out of 10 end in abortion.\n\"Everyone knows someone who's had one, whether they know it or not,\" says Nan Little Kirkpatrick, the executive director of the \nTexas Equal Access Fund\n, which helps women pay for abortions. \nWhile there's no place in Lubbock to get an abortion these days, there are still plenty of places and groups dedicated to talking women out of abortions. \nThe \nNurturing Center\n, which advertises pregnancy support services and free sonograms, opened next to the now-shuttered abortion clinic by design. On top of ultrasounds, the center offers peer counseling, baby items, referrals to adoption agencies, limited financial assistance -- and lots and lots of warnings about abortions. \n\"We believe in the sanctity of all life,\" explains Lawrence D'Souza, the 73-year-old executive director. \"Cradle to grave and womb to tomb.\"\nHis eyes tear up when he wonders how many scientists have died because they weren't allowed to be born. He reads aloud from a list of scenarios given to women who come to the clinic.\n\"It's the year 1955, a lady is pregnant with a baby out of wedlock, her family would disown her and so will her community. Should she abort?\"\nHe looks up, to make sure I'm listening, before he reads on: \"You would have killed Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, and nobody would have an iPhone.\"\nThe idea to open his center at this location came to him during a clinic protest years ago, after he saw abortion seekers mistakenly walk toward the entry of what was then a closed-down dental clinic. If D'Souza, then a steel company controller, set up shop in that old clinic and put up a sign in lights, there was no telling how many lives he could save.\nSometimes, even though the abortion clinic has been closed for more than two years, women still show up at his center next door thinking they're at Planned Parenthood. \n\"Women are choosing life maybe because they have no other option,\" says Elizabeth Trevino, the center's director of client services. \nShe wears a purple T-shirt emblazoned with a cross and a reference to scripture. When she used to protest outside the clinic, she says she preferred to show love rather than scare off women. She passed out rosaries, baby booties and onesies. \nShe beams after introducing two Texas Tech activists who are involved with the student-led organization Raiders Defending Life. For two years in a row, their school has been named the most politically active campus in the state at a \nTexas Right to Life\n student conference.\nTrevino describes the information she shares with women about the dangers of abortion. They're the very claims medical professionals dispute and include risks of severe psychological trauma. \n\"I have yet to meet a woman who has not regretted her abortion,\" she says.\nThat means Trevino hasn't met Anne, a Lubbock-area woman who was years beyond middle-of-the-night feedings when she found herself pregnant. A married professional in her late 40s and already the mother of three, including a teenager, this was a life twist she didn't see coming -- and didn't think was possible.\nThe decision to have an abortion was easy for her and her husband. Never mind that they didn't want more kids, the thought of carrying a baby to term in her body, at this age, felt dangerous.\nShe was lucky and had the resources to travel. Her husband was able to watch the kids. She could reschedule some meetings and didn't have to craft excuses for a boss or risk losing pay. She could afford to fly to Denver and not waste a day driving hundreds of miles. She was able to foot a hotel bill. \nThe procedure the next morning took minutes and, she says, felt no different than a pap smear. But the $1,500 journey, which could have been a lunch-break appointment had Lubbock still had a clinic, felt at best ridiculous and at worst like a violation.\n\"It bothered me so much after I got back. This could have happened to someone else who doesn't have the means I have,\" says Anne, who asked that I not use her real name. \"This is a real issue affecting real women, not just teenagers acting irresponsibly.\"\nA Texas education\nHere in this abortion desert, though, it seems there's more than a lack of clinics. There's also a scarcity of knowledge -- the very kind needed to act responsibly. \nThe Lubbock area is home to a number of colleges, including Lubbock Christian University, Wayland Baptist University and South Plains College. The largest, by far, is Texas Tech University, home of the Red Raiders.\nA group of Texas Tech undergrads, hailing from different parts of the state, tell me about the abstinence-only assemblies they were required to attend in public school and the pledges they felt pressured to sign at 13. \n\"I signed because I wanted to fit in,\" says Catherine Ragsdale, 20, an officer in the school's Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance. \"I didn't know what sex was.\" \nAnother student, who learned she was pregnant over winter break, paints the picture of how Texas' anti-abortion culture colored her reaction. She didn't know who she could talk to at school and worried about being judged for scheduling an abortion (which she ended up canceling after she miscarried). One of her best friends had already dropped out of college to have her own baby. Everyone had tried to be happy: \"Congrats!\" they said. What would they now think of her?\nThere was no mention of birth control in their Texas schools, or at least there wasn't supposed to be. One student sang the praises of a teacher who broke the law in seventh grade to tell students about safe sex. Health classes generally amounted to being bombarded with horrifying photos of STDs.  \nIt's no wonder, these young women say, that so many of their peers are clueless -- and that \"Raider Rash,\" the school's signature sexually transmitted infection, is so widespread it has a name among students there. \nFaculty in the women's studies department offer additional commentary.\nSara White teaches an introduction to women's studies course, which draws 40 students, equal parts men and women. When she asks students to list the forms of birth control they know about, she says, 9 out of 10 can only come up with abstinence and condoms. \nShe talks about the young man who said he drank bleach believing it would keep him from impregnating a woman. One student who got pregnant wrote an email to White in a panic: \"I didn't think his penis was big enough,\" as if size was linked to fertility. Other women have admitted douching with Mountain Dew to keep from conceiving. \n\"They say it's something about carbonation,\" a student nearby explains. \nOne young woman told her classmates to set a timer when having sex. She explained that guys only last seven minutes, so if you stop before then you're fine. \n\"This method was flawed, though,\" White says. \"The student had a child.\" \nWhite shows them what she calls \"the birth control website.\" It's just the \nPlanned Parenthood site\n, although she doesn't say the name out loud.\nIn it for the long haul\nOutside a Dallas clinic, one of two in the city, the regular protesters assemble and scream. One protester arrives lugging a huge crucifix. Beside her are two small children.\nA clinic staffer rushing inside yells back with a broad smile, \"I love my job! Free IUDs!\"\nSince HB2 forced the closure of abortion clinics across Texas, this Dallas facility has nearly doubled in capacity. For a time, the waiting area was standing-room only. The wait for an appointment jumped from five days to about 20. The clinic had to acquire adjacent space, \"a hemorrhoid center of all things,\" one physician says. \nThe clinic sees about twice as many patients as before HB2; about 200 come through each week. Patients arrive from all over North Texas as well as Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas.\nOBGYNs in private practice in Texas may perform abortions on occasion, but they certainly don't advertise this, says Heather Busby, the executive director of \nNARAL Pro-Choice Texas\n. And if hospitals do elective abortions, they risk losing public and private funding. That makes clinics the overwhelming go-to place, which means women of all backgrounds, ages, races and socioeconomic status walk through these doors. \nFour physicians work here, some more days than others. Additional doctors are expected to pitch in soon. \nOne doctor, who insists on not being identified, keeps what she does quiet for her and her family's protection. She doesn't touch social media and often wears sunglasses, even when there is no sun. \nWhen abortion providers in Texas meet with a new patient, they are legally required to read off a list of risks -- a list the doctor calls \"ridiculous.\" Among the warnings: Abortion may cause breast cancer and infertility. \nThe doctor says she explains to patients that while she has to say these things, science doesn't back up these statements. Yes, women who carry a baby to term are less likely to get breast cancer, but abortions do not \ncause\n breast cancer. And there's no evidence linking infertility to uncomplicated abortions, she says. \nNearly 90% of abortions happen within the first term of pregnancy, when there's a less than 0.05% risk of major complications, \naccording to the American Journal of Public Health\n. In fact, \"the risk of death associated with abortion is about one-tenth that associated with childbirth,\" the \nGuttmacher Institute\n reports.\n\"It's really frustrating and tiresome to explain this to people over and over again,\" the doctor says. \"They've already gone through so much to get here.\"\nShe remembers the young college woman from Lubbock who took a bus for eight hours by herself to get here. She'd been afraid to visit a crisis pregnancy center in Lubbock like the Nurturing Center for fear she'd be judged and shamed for wanting an abortion. The doctor began the exam, only to find that the student had a growing ectopic, or tubal, pregnancy -- a condition that can be life threatening.\n\"It was extremely dangerous. It could have burst on her bus ride,\" the doctor says. \"She literally could have died.\" \nShe told the young woman that she would need to go to the hospital immediately and would likely need surgery. The patient, who was in Dallas all alone and scared, insisted that she needed to first go to the bus station to change her ticket, or else she'd lose her fare back to school. \n\"My heart just sank,\" the doctor says. \nAnother doctor, who also won't be named, walks in mocking what she's wearing. She's in a whole surgical getup -- scrubs, a gown, a bonnet, her booties had just been pulled off -- new requirements since the passage of HB2. \nThe Texas abortion law says physicians must have hospital admitting privileges and clinics must meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs. \nThis language may not sound like a big deal, but these are the matters that will be taken up in front of the nation's highest court on Wednesday. \nHospitals that don't provide abortions themselves and are state-funded, faith-based or otherwise politically hogtied won't give admitting privileges to an abortion provider. \nThen there are the standards of ASCs -- which include building codes like specified door heights, room sizes and hallway widths to accommodate gurneys abortion clinics don't use -- which amount to construction costs most facilities can't swing.\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court upholds this Texas law, more clinics may close, and not just in Texas. Some states already have similar laws in place; others are watching with their own versions poised and ready to drop. \nAnother ASC standard is what has this doctor dressed as if she's about to perform heart surgery. \nAll this for a procedure she usually completes in about five minutes. Not because she rushes, she says, but because she's good and the procedure is simple. \nThis doctor flies in once a week from New Mexico to work in this Dallas clinic. She hates that she, too, hides who she is and what she does, but in today's climate she feels she has no choice.  \nShe also remembers a woman who'd traveled by bus from afar. She arrived amid heavy rains. A power outage had closed the clinic. Unable to afford a hotel room, the woman roamed the streets over the weekend and spent her nights in a round-the-clock laundromat. \nWhen the clinic finally reopened and she got in, she was required by Texas law to wait another 24 hours after her sonogram before having one of the doctor's five-minute abortions. The clinic got her a hotel room so she could at least clean up, sleep and stay warm. \nBoth these doctors were trained in other fields -- one as a family physician, the other as an OBGYN -- before completing fellowships in family planning. \nFor 43 years, since the passage of \nRoe v. Wade\n, women have been entitled to abortions under the law in this country. And no matter the challenges, these doctors insist they're in it for the long haul. \nThere's still plenty of misinformation in their way, however.\nAfter the passage of HB2, callers to a fund that helps cover abortion costs proved this. They were confused and especially scared, the fund's director tells me. They wanted to know if they'd be arrested for getting an abortion. \nSo the fund changed its outgoing voice mail message to remind women: \"Abortion is still legal in Texas.\"", "The slow crawl to designer babies": "\"You can tell he takes his physique quite seriously...  his eyes...\n seemed bottomless.\" \nThese are not descriptions from romance novels, nor are they OKCupid profiles. These are actual descriptions you'll find when sperm-shopping online.\nWith a few mouse clicks and a credit card, you can order the beginnings of a specific type of baby. And as genetic technology improves, there will be many more ways for us to choose the kind of child we have. The question is, will we?\nThought leaders, scientists and policy makers from both countries \nare holding a historic summit in Washington\n this week to debate the question of \"when, if ever, we will want to use gene editing to change human inheritance,\" as David Baltimore of Caltech, the summit chairman, put it in his opening remarks. This is the latest conversation among experts to try to determine how much technology is too much. \nFor generations, reproductive medical technology has advanced, sometimes faster than popular opinion. But historically, opinions shift to welcome the advances. Now, as millions of parents struggle with fertility challenges and turn to technology, the broader question is, will they use science to create not merely healthier babies, but designer babies who have extraordinary traits?\n A Victorian phenomenon \nThis possibility may sound like the plot of \"\nGattaca\n,\" a futuristic movie where all babies are designed for perfection, but science has been intervening in pregnancy since the Victorian era. The first doctor-designed baby that we know of \nwas born in 1884\n.\nA Quaker couple with fertility problems didn't know they'd change reproductive history when they sought \ntheir doctor's\n help. Using \nthe \nVictorian technology\n of the day\n, the Philadelphia doctor put the woman under anesthesia and inseminated her with sperm donated from a medical student. Using Victorian reasoning, the doctor didn't tell the woman how she got pregnant. \nThe baby was healthy, but she never knew the child wasn't her husband's. Eventually the doctor confessed to her husband and published the case 25 years later. The procedure itself (not the fact that he didn't tell the woman or get her consent) made the doctor a pariah. Other scientists who pioneered reproductive technology lost jobs for\n \"messing with nature.\" \nNontraditional pregnancies became such a debate in the 1940s that Pope Pius XII denied millions of Catholics the option, condemning it for \n\"tak(ing) the Lord's work into their own hands.\"\nHow IVF evolved\nEventually popular opinion accepted this technology as a medically ethical practice. \nA record number \nof women have used in vitro fertilization \nto get pregnant\n. At least 55 million people can thank IVF for their existence.\nIVF tech has also evolved, although it's still intrusive, time-consuming and expensive. Typically, primary-care physicians don't perform the procedure. Instead, \nspecialized clinics\n freeze, store and test the sperm for diseases.\nUsing pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, doctors need only an eight-cell embryo to test for about 100 genetic diseases.\n\"Genetic screening like this has really taken off and helps improve the odds to eliminate a disease that is life threatening and it can improve the effectiveness of the IVF treatment,\" said Dr. Jessica Spencer, a reproductive endocrinologist at the\n Emory University School of Medicine'\ns department of gynecology and obstetrics.   \nDoctors also can tell the embryo's sex at this early stage. Sex detection is banned in many countries to prevent parents from terminating a pregnancy because they prefer one sex over the other. U.S. law does not restrict sex detection, so American clinics that offer the option are popular with clients from countries that don't allow it. (Spencer's reproductive center at Emory doesn't offer the service).\nThree-parent birth has arrived\nA technology currently banned in the United States that \ngot UK approval in February\n lets scientists combine the genetic material of three people to eliminate a DNA mutation that create conditions like blindness or epilepsy.  \nScientists replace mitochondria in an egg that contains a defect with healthy donor mitochondria. U.S. scientists have tried a similar technique replacing cytoplasm and created more than a dozen babies without the mutation, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stopped that practice after questions about the long-term consequences. More than 40 countries outlaw any practice of human genetic modification that can be inherited. The U.S. does not go that far and the FDA is currently re-examining the banned three-parent procedure. \nSome ethicists worry this same technique could open the door to genetic modification procedures that would go beyond improving a child's health, to select for eye color or hair color or intelligence. \n\"I am absolutely certain this is coming,\" said \nRonald Green\n, a Dartmouth College professor author of \"Babies by Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice\" who has served on the National Institutes of Health's human embryo research panel. \"By the end of this century, I am absolutely confident that we will have the tools for someone with the means to use this information to change the child they can have through this process.\"\nAre short men endangered?\nPolls show\n most Americans are leery of technology that goes beyond disease elimination. That might change if technology gives a child an advantage, Green believes. \n\"\nNo one (knew they) wanted the iPhone\n at first, but Steve Jobs made it and everyone has one,\" Green said. \"This will be no different.\" \nFor instance, he thinks parents may want taller boys. \n\"It's a terrible thing for a male to be short, even if this is not a disease, to be short, studies show the child earns less, will be more likely to be bullied, or may not be asked to lead,\" Green said. \"I can see parents saying, 'Let's create a taller child.'\"\nAs an ethicist, Green doesn't believe parents should choose modifications that turn their child into the next Michael Jordan. Nor does he think genetic manipulation should be used for racially discriminatory or homophobic reasons. But he believes some cosmetic applications may become more accepted.\nWhat's next\nUsing DNA from potential sperm donors and recipients, one reproductive technology company, Genepeeks, can create virtual embryos to screen for more than 600 diseases. That's more than traditional tests. \nTheir patent application \ncovers future tests in development that could screen for traits like a person's propensity to drink or do drugs, or to see if their grooming behaviors will be tidy or sloppy.\nAllan Hanson, a professor of sociocultural anthropology at the \nUniversity of Kansas \nwho's interviewed hundreds of women who had children using IVF, doesn't anticipate a kind of designer baby arms race, even with improved technology.  \nHe said that most of the women he interviewed \"tend to want a healthy child, and beyond that they want a child who is like themselves,\" Hanson said. \"Someone who may look like them and someone who will have the same skill level and intelligence.\" \nHanson did interview two clients of the so-called \"\ngenius sperm bank\n,\" a facility that picks donors based on achievements and intelligence, as opposed to donors picked solely on appearance, race or sperm quality. \nOne client said she chose that bank because she preferred an highly intelligent child. The other didn't. \n\"Often they will select a sperm donor from the kind of guy that she might have married,\" Hanson said. \"A lot of essays assume that the minute you can improve the genetic quality of your child you will do this, that this will become a fertility arms race. I don't find that in the research I've done. I don't see that changing.\"\nFertility specialist Spencer agrees. \n\"We are not there yet, first of all,\" Spencer said. \"I have no doubt as the genome is better characterized, there will be more ways of detecting things that aren't necessarily associated with health problems.\"\n\"And there are always going to be rogue practitioners who will take it upon themselves to do things that the rest of the community does not agree with. But I personally feel other clinics will be reliable and will follow our professional guidelines that will not be as permissive.\"", "Your brain on fantasy sports": "Today, fantasy sports is a \nmultibillion-dollar industry\n. According to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, \n56.8 million people\n played in some sort of fantasy league last year -- about 14% of the entire U.S. population. Two-thirds of players are male, according to the trade association; most are college-educated and almost half earn more than $75,000 annually. \nSo how is it that educated, high-paid sports fans get sucked into high-tech games of make-believe, games that often keep them obsessively checking scores and tweaking lineups? It's about the love of the game, camaraderie -- and maybe a strong shot of dopamine in the brain.\nFrom 'book club' to big business\nFantasy baseball credits its beginnings to journalist \nDaniel Okrent\n, a former New York Times public editor, who \nginned up the idea during a long flight\n. He presented the idea to friends while having lunch at a New York restaurant, La Rotisserie Francaise, and they agreed to play. Rotisserie baseball -- what's now known as fantasy baseball -- was born. \n\"I can't really tell you what prompted my Rotisserie/fantasy urge,\" the lifelong baseball fan said, \"other than it was the off-season and I was missing baseball.\"\nFor years, it was relegated to sports geeks holed up in a room together. \"A lot of math, statistics, dispensed through the mail. It was very labor intensive. ... It wasn't customizable,\" said Brendan Dwyer, a researcher at the \nCenter for Sport Leadership\n at Virginia Commonwealth University. \nBut once it took off online, fantasy sports gave people a chance to stay connected, whether they're in the same city or on opposite sides of the world.\n\"People play to stay in contact with people, to have something to talk about, especially for men. Sports in general has been a space for men to communicate ... and now fantasy sports is an enhanced version of that,\" Dwyer said. \"I like to equate it to the male version of a book club.\"\nRemember Judd Apatow's 2007 comedy \"\nKnocked Up\n\"? In the movie, Debbie, a character played by Leslie Mann, is convinced that her husband, Pete, played by Paul Rudd, is cheating on her. She even follows Pete to the house where the affair is supposedly taking place and sneaks in. Finding nothing, she's about to leave when she hears voices -- and discovers Pete sitting around with a bunch of other guys in baseball gear, a meetup he'd attended secretly.\nThe sense of community is fun, but it's healthy, too. Studies have found that \nloneliness\n can negatively impact our health. Socially isolated people have shorter life spans and increased risk of infections, heart disease and depression.  \nThe camaraderie has kept public relations adviser Matthew Berger playing in the same league for the past 20 years. For Berger, it's become a professional network of sorts. His league includes prominent journalists, business executives and diplomats, some of whom have flown in from overseas just for the draft. Berger has cut trips short to attend the draft in person.\nFor Berger, fantasy baseball connects him even more to the game he loves. The players seem more real if you're buying and selling like a team owner, Berger said.\n\"It's the really getting to sort of see the players as more than just the guys on TV,\" he said.\nThe power of fantasy sports\nEven if a person never comes close to really owning a sports team, managing a successful fantasy team can come with bragging rights. The drive to compete can be just as strong.\n\"I'm very competitive. ... To me, it's like a test of my own knowledge,\" said \nRenee Miller\n, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester who writes about daily fantasy sports for ESPN. \nShe speculates that the people who play fantasy sports are risk takers. While it hasn't been measured specifically in fantasy sports players, Miller said research has found that the brains of risk takers have more sensitive reward circuitry -- their brains get more of the neurotransmitter dopamine when they are doing something they enjoy. Dopamine is the chemical your brain releases when you experience or anticipate pleasure or a reward.\n\"When you have more dopamine, it rewards that behavior and provides motivation for playing again,\" Miller said.\nMost of the behaviors that we are rewarded for are actions that have evolved to keep us alive as a species, said Miller. For example, eating foods high in sugar (for energy) or having sex (for procreation). \nBut there are\n behaviors like gambling that also can send the reward circuitry \ninto overdrive in some people's brains. \n\"Not just the win, but near misses can cause increased dopamine,\" said Miller. \nShe said risk-taking itself has been seen to be\n an attractive feature when finding a mate. \n\"People with increased reward sensitivity tend to exhibit when they are in front of their peers,\" Miller said. \nShe thinks fantasy sports -- particularly fantasy football -- might attract these types of personalities.\n'Is your brain sabotaging your lineup?' \nBut there might be different drivers among fantasy baseball fans, she noted. During a typical baseball season, a team will play 162 games, and each one might have a different lineup. It demands a lot of commitment and study of numbers. \nAnd although most people believe they are logical and rational when making decisions, in fact, our brains likes to take shortcuts, said Miller, who wrote the book \n\"Cognitive Bias in Fantasy Sports: Is Your Brain Sabotaging Your Team?\" \nIf we are invested in something, we value it more. So whoever we draft for our teams, she said, we tend to align with our own identities and attribute more to their value than they are really worth. It's known as the endowment effect. \n\"Say you're at the store and you're trying to decide between three pairs of shoes. By the end of the day, you will like the ones that you bought 60% more. We do the same thing with our fantasy players -- and that influences all kinds of decisions,\" said Miller.\nPlayers may not be willing to make changes when they're winning, even if a lineup change could improve the team -- or they might be quick to change things when their record is down.\n\"One of the things that I try to emphasize is, be aware of these tendencies -- be aware of how they can impact you in all kinds of situations,\" said Miller. \nMiller, who was in seven fantasy football leagues, one fantasy basketball league and a baseball league last year, said she did most of her research between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Miller has found she enjoys daily fantasy sports, where players manage a team for a day, even more than the long, drawn-out seasons.\nWhen fandom turns to addiction\n\"There's a lot of sports enthusiasts that are involved in the game. But what makes its more of an addiction is the immediate gratification, which ultimately leads to addiction. ... It's a form of escape,\" said \nKimberly Young\n, a psychologist and founder of the \nCenter for Internet Addiction\n. \nYoung said she is seeing more patients for whom fantasy sports is more than just a hobby. \n\"Ten years ago we weren't talking about (fantasy sports addiction),\" she said. \"Now, there's a whole new generation, so you have a more diverse group of people, more immediate gratification, more advertising to it -- to those who are clinically addicted.\" Most of these people have other issues as well, she said, like obsessive-compulsive disorder or depression, on top of their fantasy sports addiction. \nBut Young cautions that she only sees the most extreme cases, where people shut off other parts of their lives. \"People who have a mild problem aren't going to call the doctor,\" said Young. \nUltimately, Young says, it boils down to the brain -- and the brain perceives all addiction the same, no matter what the activity is. \nAlthough there's sometimes money to be made on daily fantasy sports, Virginia Commonwealth's Dwyer argues that a fantasy addiction isn't the same as a gambling addiction. Gambling is an antisocial behavior, Dwyer said, while daily fantasy sports has much more pro-social behaviors that bring people together and make them feel connected. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association said that fantasy sports isn't gambling, a game of chance. It said fantasy sports is a game of skill. \nRead: Daily fantasy sports are banned in New York\nBut for many, fantasy sports is just a way to extend their love of the game.\n\"It's fun. It's a great distraction. It gets me more engaged in watching the games,\" Berger said.\nAnd for others, fantasy sports has become too much work. Just ask Okrent, its creator. He never anticipated it ballooning into the enterprise it is today. \"If I had, I would be a very rich man,\" he said.\nHe said he stopped playing in 1995, picked up a simpler league in 2001, then stopped for good in 2009.\n\"I decided I wanted to be a fan again,\" he said, \"to go to games, watch them, and listen to them simply for the sheer joy and beauty of the game.\" ", "Dancer: 'I am so much more than my wheelchair'": "\"I grew up watching 'The Nutcracker' on television,\" she remembers. \" \"Someday,' I said, 'I'm going to do that.' \"\nBut Westerman faced a challenge: She had cerebral palsy.  \nGrowing up, she endured more than 15 surgeries on her legs to help with mobility. The last one left her in a wheelchair permanently.\n\"I don't regret going through any of them because every experience I've had has made me the person I am, and I like who I am,\" she says. \"So I really don't have anything to complain about.\"\nWesterman went to a small school for disabled children; her class consisted of six people. She participated in concert choir, chess club and student council. She also excelled as a student, making the honor roll. She is grateful her parents didn't integrate her into the large public high school. \n\"I would've been lost in the shuffle,\" she says. \"I don't think I would have learned as much in that setting, because I would've just been forgotten and pushed aside. Not just because of my disability but because of sheer numbers.\"\nShe's also thankful her parents and brothers didn't treat her differently. \"That was probably the biggest gift they could give me,\" Westerman says with a smile.\nShe was a \"normal kid,\" and that allowed her to become independent.\nWhen she was 11, she decided she wanted to dance, and her parents were supportive.\n\"They said, 'If you want to do something, then try as hard as you can to make it happen,' \" the Colorado resident recalls. \"And if you can't, then we'll help you find a way that you can do it.\" \nWesterman started dancing with an all-wheelchair square dance team called the Colorado Wheelers. The feelings of flying and being free are two of the reasons she loves to dance. \n\"If I'm dancing with a partner, they can take me by the hand and propel me across the floor or stage,\" she explains. \"And my hands, my arms, are completely free to do whatever I want to do.\"\nAfter graduating high school, Westerman tried her hand at acting but faced disappointment at audition after audition.  Producers and directors were unsure how to incorporate her into shows. So she and a few friends decided to start a theater  company for people with disabilities, called \nPhamaly\n. \nThen she met Paul Fiorino. \n\"He was the first person who saw me as a dancer, not a person with a disability who wanted to dance,\" Westerman says.\nPhamaly and Fiorino's company Ballet Arts Theatre collaborated to perform at \"Dance Event 2000.\" It was there that Westerman met and was paired with her long-term dance partner, David Mineo. The connection was instant. \n\"To be Teri's dance partner has been quite an interesting, unique experience,\" Mineo says. \"She's just a beautiful spirit.\"\nWesterman's accomplishments continued to rack up. She was crowned Ms. Wheelchair Colorado in 2000 and competed in ballroom competitions in both the United States and Europe. \nIn 2012, Westerman co-founded \nSpoke N Motion Dance\n, a nonprofit integrated dance company.  \n\"Anybody from any level of dance background or any level of physical ability is more than welcome in the company,\" she says, beaming.   \"I don't believe in auditions. I think auditions are necessary in some instances, but I choose not to use them for Spoke N Motion because I feel like people with disabilities are judged enough.\"\nWesterman hopes she will inspire others to believe in themselves and realize that having a disability does not have to define you.\n\"I am so much more than my wheelchair. I used to tell people, 'See the person first,' \" she explains. \"But if all you see when you look at me is the wheelchair, you have no idea who I am.\"", "How I gave my wife Zika virus": "Suddenly, a virus that wasn't supposed to be a game changer in the United States took on a whole new dimension. It spurred the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add \nrecommendations for safe sex \nto the already growing list of precautions needed to protect pregnant women from getting Zika and possibly infecting their unborn babies.\nBut here's what is most startling: The Dallas case wasn't unique. The first known case of sexually acquired Zika in the United States actually occurred eight years ago in northern Colorado after a husband and wife reunion. \nThe story of how microbiologist Brian Foy obtained Zika in Africa and passed it to his wife, Joy Chilson Foy, when he returned home reads like a detective novel: frozen blood, false leads, a clever clue from Africa and finally success -- laboratory proof that Foy had given a mosquito-borne virus to his wife during sex.\nMosquito magnets\nIt was the summer of 2008. Colorado State University Professor Brian Foy was in southeastern Senegal with graduate student Kevin Kobylinski, collecting mosquitoes. They were studying how to stop the spread of malaria as part of a research grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  \nEach day, Foy, Kobylinski and African researcher Massamba Sylla trekked miles from their camp to the villages of Ibel and Ndebou, nestled at the base of hillsides in this West African nation. They arrived before dawn so they could capture mosquitoes that had preyed on villagers in their homes during the night. \n\"One village was taking this drug, ivermectin, to cure themselves of a tropical parasitic worm,\" Foy explained to CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.  \"We were studying how well the drug affects the survival of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria.\"\nIt was hot, sweaty work -- just the thing to attract bloodthirsty mosquitoes looking for their next meal. But as not to scare them off, the men could not use any mosquito repellent.\n\"As scientists, you tend to put your work ahead of your personal safety at times,\" Foy said. \"We take malaria prophylaxis. I get all the vaccines that I can possibly get.\n\"But because of the nature of our work, tromping through the village until the sun rises, sweating way too hard, wearing aspirators on our backs that are kind of like big vacuum cleaners that suck the mosquitoes out of people's huts, unfortunately, we were bitten a lot.\"\nFinishing up their work in late August, Foy and Kobylinski headed back to the United States. \n\"When we got back, I was fine,\" said Foy. \"I was happy to see my wife, Joy, my four kids and everyone. It wasn't until approximately 10 days after we left the villages that I started feeling ill.\"\nA puzzling illness\nIt began with a rash on his back and torso, headache, light sensitivity and ever-worsening joint pain and swelling. \n\"My wrists, ankles and my thumb joints in particular definitely got worse,\" Foy said. \"I remember very specifically after a whole week had passed, it really hit me. I just needed to cover my eyes and lay down. I was really tired.\"\nFoy thought he'd probably contracted a flavivirus, one of a family of mosquito and tick-borne arboviruses, transmitted by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. She's an aggressive biter that only preys on humans and prefers to feed during the day, unlike the malaria-carrying mosquito, which bites at night. She also likes to live, breed and bite inside homes, rarely flying more than a short hop to her next human victim. \n\"We like to say she's the rat of the mosquito world, highly adapted to urban tropical environments,\" Foy said. \"The species used to breed in small tree holes, in places like West Africa, but it seems to be a very simple leap for this mosquito to then lay its eggs in used tires, or cans and trash that are around human settlements.\"\n\"There were also lot of nonhuman primates in the villages in Senegal,\" Foy added. \"Most of these arboviruses have their roots in primates. So mosquitoes might bite a monkey and pick up the virus and then bite the villagers, passing on things like dengue, chikungunya and even Zika.\" \nBut Zika, which was only discovered in a Uganda forest in the late 1940s, was the last suspect on Foy's mind. His bet was on \ndengue\n or \nchikungunya\n, two viruses characterized by fever, joint pain, swelling and rash. Despite his illness, the hunt was on. \n\"I'm a scientist. I want to figure out what's going on, and it's my field,\" Foy said. \"I'm thinking, 'All right, I need to take my blood. If we can get blood while I'm having acute symptoms, then we have a chance of catching the virus. And I need to document my symptoms, and I need to call my student, Kevin, and see if he had the same thing.'\" \nSure enough, Kobylinski had come down with a similar rash and body aches about the same time as Foy.\n\"There were definitely some times by the end of the day, I couldn't type at all,\" said Kobylinski.  \"It was difficult to operate things with my hands.\"\n\"I said 'All right, start documenting your symptoms, Kevin. We're going to get your blood drawn,' \" Foy remembers. \"We got our blood drawn, but then, of course, my wife got it.\n\"And that's what really started having the light bulbs go off in my head saying, OK, there's something odd going on here, because this should have been a mosquito-borne transmission.\"\nThe hunt for a mysterious virus\nFor Foy, the only scientific way to prove sexual transmission was to eliminate other potential causes, one by one. Since Chilson Foy had not left northern Colorado in over a year, if she'd been bitten by an infected mosquito, it had to be near their home. \n\"I grabbed some traps from my lab, and set them in my yard, to see if we had mosquitoes that potentially could be the same species that might transmit an arbovirus,\" said Foy. \"But this was in early September in Colorado. There wasn't really anything out.\"\nAt any time of year, northern Colorado is \nnot the place to find the Aedes aegypti \nin the United States. She's primarily a southern gal, with the biggest concentration found in the Florida Keys and along the Texas-Mexico border. The other, less efficient carrier of Zika is the Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito. She's also not likely to be found in Colorado.\nWhile Foy was mosquito hunting, Chilson Foy, a registered oncology nurse, was documenting her symptoms, taking snapshots of her rashes and getting her blood drawn and certified at a local laboratory. \n\"So, your wife has developed the same symptoms as you by now, and you're piecing this together. How sick does Joy get?\" Gupta asked.\n\"She got worse than I did, by far,\" Foy said. \"Her joint pain was stronger, and it lasted a lot longer. She couldn't really open cans, and things like that, for quite a long time. And I think her symptoms of headache and aversion to light were a lot stronger than mine.\"\nAnother clue emerged. As Foy's illness progressed, he began having prostate pain and blood in his semen, mounting evidence for a sexual link to the virus transmission.\n\"But when you gave the virus to your wife, you were feeling fine, right?\" asked Gupta. \"You weren't sick at that point?\"\n\"Exactly,\" Foy said. \"We had just seen each other for the first time in months. You do what husbands and wives do. But later, when I'm feeling sick, I'm not having any sort of relations. I think any transmission event would have happened very soon after I got back, before I got symptoms.\"\n'Many things we don't yet know about Zika'\nSpeaking in front of Congress last week, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden was blunt. \n\"We are figuring out more about Zika literally every day,\" he said. \"But as hard as we work, there are still many things that we cannot know now, and cannot do now.\"\nWith the current state of knowledge about Zika, health officials believe that a person is only contagious for as long as they are symptomatic. The problem is that only one out of five people with Zika will have any symptoms at all. In Foy's case, it would appear that he was contagious before the worst of his symptoms began.\nAnd then there's the issue of how long the virus will last in semen. \nMale testicles, along with the eyes, placenta and the fetus, are what is known as \"immune privileged\" sites, areas of the body that have special protection from an inflammatory immune response. Simply put, it means your antibodies aren't allowed in to kill off invaders, an evolutionary way of protecting procreation.\n\"Immune privilege\" affected survivors of the most recent Ebola outbreak. \nOne U.S. man \ndiscovered Ebola in his eye\n months after his blood was declared Ebola-free. And Ebola has been found in the semen of male survivors in Sierra Leone for up to \nnine months\n after it had disappeared from their blood, although the volume of the virus does appear to reduce over time. \nOther than the Dallas case, scientists today know of two more cases where Zika virus has been found in semen. One was during a 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia, just as the virus began its explosive spread around the world. A Tahitian man had three separate episodes of Zika; after the third, \nhis semen showed high levels of the virus\n, even though it was undetectable in his blood. \nA \nsecond documented case\n in the United Kingdom in 2014 found high levels of the Zika virus in semen up to 62 days after the onset of the illness; in fact the viral load was stronger at that time than when the first samples were taken. \nBut in 2008, when Foy was searching for answers, those clues weren't available. \nNo sign of dengue or yellow fever\nBy now, the blood test results had come back from the Centers for Disease Control's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado, not far from Foy's lab at the university. Foy and Kobylinski's antibody panels showed a cross-reactivity to dengue and yellow fever, meaning they had been vaccinated or exposed to those viruses. \nBut Chilson Foy's results showed nothing. No dengue. No yellow fever. No antibodies to any of the viruses on the panel.\nZika was not on the test. It was too new, too isolated, too obscure. No one had thought of adding it.\nPuzzled, Foy tossed the blood samples back into the fridge at his lab and went on with his life.\nA case of serendipity\nFast forward a year. Graduate student Kobylinski was back in Senegal, replicating malaria field studies in additional villages. \nIn a twist of fate, he found himself having lunch with Andrew Haddow, a researcher working for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Haddow's grandfather, Alexander Haddow, was a famous entomologist who had been studying tropical diseases in the Ugandan forest for decades. \n\"We were drinking beers and discussing the difficulties in working in Africa with no electricity or running water,\" Kobylinski told CNN's Gupta. \"His research team was there to study obscure viruses that affect people in that region. I mentioned that we probably had one of these lesser-known viruses and described the results that we had received from the CDC and the symptoms that we had. He told me he thought it could potentially be Zika virus.\"\n\"How did his mind go to Zika?\" asked Gupta. \"Why did he think that?\"\n\"Well, his grandfather was the man who discovered Zika virus,\" said Kobylinski. \"You know, out of the Zika forest in Uganda.\" \nBack in the states, Foy was intrigued.\n\"We basically decided, 'Jeez, we should research this,' because we weren't really satisfied with the original results; they were inconclusive,\" remembers Foy. \"Especially with relation to my wife.\"\nSo out came the frozen blood samples. This time, they sent them to Haddow who had the blood processed at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. The tests returned as positive for all three samples, including Chilson Foy's: It was Zika.\nAnother lab confirms the results. And finally the mystery was solved, at least to the extent that it could be. The scientist in Foy was still cautious about interpreting his findings.\n\"We didn't actually isolate the virus. We weren't able to. We weren't able to catch it in time,\" he said. \"Our data was indirect confirmation of that hypothesis through antibody tests. After we followed the antibodies, I clearly had Zika. Kevin clearly had Zika, and my wife definitely had Zika, because she didn't have any cross reactive antibodies to anything.\"\nExcited, the team \ndecided to publish\n what they'd found. Carefully titled \"Probable Non-Vector-borne Transmission of Zika Virus,\" the paper came out in May 2011 in the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases. While Foy, his wife and Kobylinski are listed as authors, their identities are disguised as Patient One, Patient Two and Patient Three to protect their privacy, something extremely important to Chilson Foy. However, it wasn't long before Foy, never one to dissemble, was outed.\n\"Once a clever reporter read that paper, they kind of instantly put two and two together, and said, 'It's clear that you're either Patient One or Two, and the other one is Patient Three,'\" said Foy. \"I admitted as much, and of course, after that, it kind of went crazy.\"\nBut not in a good way. The media invaded Chilson Foy's privacy at every turn, and scientific mentions of the paper often dismissed the findings as \"inconclusive.\" \"unsubstantiated\" and a \"one-off case.\"  \nThat is until now. Until Dallas.\n\"Is it redemptive, in a way?\" Gupta asked Foy. \"Nobody wants to be the first when it comes to something like this, but that you recognized it, you wrote it, you did all this almost a decade ago?\"\n\"I kind of feel proud about that,\" Foy said with a smile. \"I think anybody who was skeptical about it, any colleagues, they were just being skeptical scientists, as they should have been. They wanted to see more evidence.\" \nThe smile fades. \"Now, unfortunately, we have more evidence.\"\nNow Foy isn't thinking about his scientific detective story.  Instead he's thinking about what could have been, if things had been different.\n\"The real tragedy of all this is that right after we wrote that paper, we wrote a grant and submitted it to the National Institutes of Health to try to get funding to research this further,\" Foy said, \"with the hypothesis that Zika virus outbreaks are only going to happen more frequently, and we think sexual transmission is a possibility.\"\nThe grant didn't get funded. Foy said there's just not enough money to fund \"high-risk, high-reward, hypothesis-driven projects,\" especially when the paper seems like a \"one-off thing.\"\n\"If we would have had that work ongoing, way back when, we would have had the ability to research it, to maybe even predict that sexual transmission was going to be more frequent, when a potential virus outbreak occurred,\" Foy said. \"Maybe we would've even been on the road to therapeutics or vaccines, but now we're kind of behind, and trying to catch up.\"\nNever one to quit when it comes to science, Foy resubmitted the 2011 grant to the NIH on Tuesday. He should hear if it's being considered in about three months. ", "Woman charged with DUI has 'auto-brewery syndrome'": "That's what happened to an upstate New York woman when she blew a blood alcohol level more than four times the legal limit. Just before Christmas in Hamburg, New York, a judge dismissed the charges after being presented with evidence the woman suffers from \"auto-brewery syndrome.\"\n\"I had never heard of auto-brewery syndrome before this case,\" attorney Joseph Marusak told CNN on the condition his client's identity remain anonymous. \"But I knew something was amiss when the hospital police took the woman to wanted to release her immediately because she wasn't exhibiting any symptoms.\"\n\"That prompts me to get on the Internet and see if there is any sort of explanation for a weird reading,\" adds Marusak. \"Up pops auto-brewery syndrome and away we go.\"\n\"I'm in touch with about 30 people who believe they have this same syndrome, about 10 of them are diagnosed with it,\" said Panola College Dean of Nursing Barbara Cordell, who has studied the syndrome for years. \"They can function at alcohol levels such as 0.30 and 0.40 when the average person would be comatose or dying. Part of the mystery of this syndrome is how they can have these extremely high levels and still be walking around and talking.\"\nExtremely rare condition\nAlso known as gut-fermentation syndrome, this rare medical condition can occur when abnormal amounts of gastrointestinal yeast convert common food carbohydrates into ethanol. The process is believed to take place in the small bowel, and is vastly different from the normal gut fermentation in the large bowel that gives our bodies energy.\nFirst described in 1912 as \"germ carbohydrate fermentation,\" it was studied in the 1930s and '40s as a contributing factor to \nvitamin deficiencies and irritable bowel syndrome\n. Cases involving the \nyeast Candida albicans and Candida krusei\n have popped up in Japan, and in 2013 Cordell \ndocumented the case of a 61-year-old man\n who had frequent bouts of unexplained drunkenness for years before being diagnosed with an intestinal overabundance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or brewer's yeast, the same yeast used to make beer.\nFlat tire a blessing\nIt was a beautiful fall afternoon in 2014 when Marusak's client met her husband at a restaurant for food and drinks. She consumed \"four drinks between noon and 6 p.m.\" says Marusak, \"less than one drink an hour. We hired a local pharmacologist who said that a woman of her size and weight having four drinks in that period of time should be between 0.01 and 0.05 blood alcohol levels.\" That would be beneath the legally impaired level of 0.08 BAC in New York state.\nAnd here's the \"crazy thing,\" says Marusak. \"Her husband drives to meet friends and she is driving home. She gets a flat close to home but doesn't want to change the tire so keeps on driving. Another driver sees her struggling with the car and calls it in as an accident. So if she hadn't had that flat tire, she'd not know to this day that she has this condition.\"\nBecause she blew a blood alcohol level of nearly 0.40, police procedure is to take the accused to a hospital, as that level is considered extremely life-threatening.\nInstead of allowing his wife to be released as the hospital recommended based on her lack of drunken symptoms, the husband asked for tests to be run. Sure enough, Marusak says, the results showed a blood alcohol level of 0.30, hours and hours after her last drink. That prompted Marusak to do his own sleuthing.\n\"I hired two physician assistants and a person trained in Breathalyzers to watch her and take blood alcohol levels over a 12-hour period and had it run at the same lab used by the prosecution,\" said Marusak. \"Without any drinks, her blood level was double the legal limit at 9:15 a.m., triple the limit at 6 p.m. and more than four times the legal limit at 8:30 p.m., which correlates with the same time of day that the police pulled her over.\"\nEven more strange, says Marusak, is the fact that the woman exhibited no signs of the levels until she reached a blood alcohol level of between 0.30 and 0.40. \n\"That's when she started to feel a bit wobbly on her feet.\" Marusak explains that by pointing to the world of alcoholism, where the bodies of \"functioning alcoholics\" adapt to the high levels of booze in their blood.\nEven though the Hamburg judge dismissed the case against his client, Marusak says it's not over yet. \n\"I've heard the DA's office says they plan to appeal. I'll know more by the middle of January.\"\nAssistant Erie County District Attorney Christopher Belling confirmed a review of the judge's decision is underway but declined to comment further.\nIn the meantime, Marusak's client is treating her condition with anti-fungal medications and a yeast-free diet with absolutely no sugar, no alcohol and very low carbs.  While that works for some, Cordell says, others relapse or find little relief.", "Pakistan divided over condom advertising": "The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) had issued a directive to TV and FM radio broadcasters not to air advertisements for condoms in an attempt to ameliorate the \"negative impact\" of the content on \"tender and gentle minds of youth and children,\" according to local media. \n\"General public is very much concerned on the exposure of such products to the innocent children, which get inquisitive on features/use of the products,\" the initial directive read, \naccording to\n the country's Dawn newspaper.\nThe directive threatened 'legal action\" against media that defied the ruling.\nWhile religious voices in this deeply conservative Muslim nation have voiced their support for the ban, advocates point that it is at odds with government population control initiatives and a more progressive attitude toward family planning. \nSuch ads are a rarity in the country, which has a rapidly growing population. \nFaced with the opposition to the ban, the body acknowledged that it has raised \"social, medial and population control\" concerns and has since softened its stance and deferred the decision to its board. \nAustralian Olympians to get 'Zika-proof' condoms\nDeeply divided\nIn a document titled, \"We value opinion on all decisions,\" the regulatory body explained its rationale, suggesting that the decision \"triggered a debate in the country as to whether this is a regressive step or not\" and that \"Pakistani public opinion is diametrically opposed on such social issues.\" \nIn a situation where public opinion is so sharply divided, it said, \"it is a challenge for the regulator to take a decision acceptable to all.\" \n\"In the larger public interest, PEMRA, recognizing both shades of opinion in our society, has decided to put this decision for vetting to its board for further deliberations.\"\nCan this pill end the AIDS epidemic?\nUntil this decision is made, there will be no blanket ban on these advertisements as long as they are not aired during times when  children are expected to be watching TV and \"special care ... given to the use of language and visuals to conform to our cultural values which are going through a slow evolutionary process.\"\nThis is not the first time the regulator has clashed with the prophylactic industry. Last year, PEMRA \nbanned a condom ad\n after receiving complaints, calling it \"immoral\" and contrary to religious norms. ", "'Resting bitch face' is real, scientists say": "The phenomenon known as \"resting bitch face\" is real, according to scientists. Better yet, there's research available that could explain why some people are \"throwing shade.\" \nIn a study conducted in October 2015, scientists Abbe Macbeth and Jason Rogers from Noldus Information Technology, a company that develops software for observational and behavioral research, used the company's FaceReader software to analyze the faces of celebrities like Kanye West, Kristen Stewart, Anna Kendrick and Queen Elizabeth II, notable public figures who have been known to occasionally wear a less-than-pleased expression.\n\"We were looking to see if anything popped out,\" Macbeth said. \"Our software is objective. It's not prone to human subjectivity like we are.\"\nWhat they discovered was that celebrities who had bored or annoyed looks were showing underlying levels of emotions that are not seen in people who don't have RBF.\nReading your face\nHere's how the software works: Scientists pick a neutral-looking image of a person \u2014 one in which they aren't smiling \u2014 and run it through the FaceReader software. The software then registers the face and gives a percentage of underlying emotions it's picking up. \nOn an average reading, the software will register a face at 97% neutral. But there's about 3% of an underlying expression, Macbeth explained. That 3% is made of emotions that show traces of sadness, happiness or anger, for example.\n\"We see that people who have this RBF expression [have] double the amount of emotionality expressed,\" she said. Those afflicted with RBF may show a jump of trace emotions as high as 6% and most of the emotion expressed is of contempt: the feeling that something is worthless or deserving scorn. \nSubtle facial expressions like a slightly pulled-back lip or squinting eyes are read as contempt, Macbeth said. \nCelebrities with neutral faces are people like Jennifer Aniston and Blake Lively, Macbeth said. Although their faces are neutral, according to the software, people will register Aniston and Lively's faces as happy faces.\nSo what does this mean if you think you have RBF? Is there some hidden amount of contempt boiling up inside you? Some unresolved issues that you need to talk about? Macbeth said there's not a clear-cut answer just yet.\nCultural differences and gender bias may play a role in people's perception of RBF. \"Eastern European people are seen as very stoic and not showing a lot of emotion and ... a lot of the people touted as having RBF are women,\" Macbeth said.\nStreet art project wants you to \"stop telling women to smile\"\nShe and Rogers, both behavioral neuroscientists, want to do more with the data than just identify who has RBF. They want to know why some people have it and what RBF means in terms of a person's psychology. Most important, they also want to understand why people react so negatively to a face with RBF. \n\"We've all heard the anecdotal evidence of people being told to smile more ... there's something that is unconsciously showing up on people's faces when people think they are just being neutral,\" Macbeth said.\nRBF first gained attention when a meme took over the Internet in 2013. That, plus a \nviral mock-public service announcement\n on \"Bitchy Resting Face\" made the \"condition\" somewhat of a joke. \nIs RBF really a thing?\nBut RBF is a real phenomenon, according to David B. Givens, director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies in Spokane, Washington. He calls the condition blank face and said in \nstudies\n, subjects judge a neutral, expressionless face to be \"unfriendly.\"\nAnthony S. Youn, a board certified plastic surgeon in Detroit, has RBF and said it's a combination of multiple forces.\n \"Gravity combined with genetics can pull our mouths down. As we get older and our skin gets looser and it gives us a permanent frown,\" he said.\nWhen it comes to whether software can detect the emotions behind RBF, Youn said he doesn't know if what Noldus's software is seeing is true emotions. \"I don't think they can tell if it's true sadness or bitterness,\" he said. \"I have it, but it doesn't mean I am in a bad mood.\"\nIt doesn't hurt to try smiling, though. There's research to suggest that smiling can boost a person's happiness levels. \"The expression on our face can affect our mood,\" he said. \nNevertheless, there are a few people who really want to know if they have RBF, Macbeth said. Since Tuesday, when people started discovering they can get their face analyzed, Noldus Information Technology has received more than 150 photos from people asking to see if they have RBF  \nAnother way to see if you have RBF, or if you will have it in the future, can be as easy as looking at your relatives, Youn said. \"The biggest predictor of those who have RBF is if your parents have it,\" he said.\nIf you fear you have \nthat \nface and are worried why so many people think you look angry all the time,\n you can share your photo \nwith Noldus and find out if you have RBF.", "Drug baggies of London: 'Addiction made public'": "It's something he had been planning to do for quite some time, but the thought of accumulating trash for a project seemed like a \"scummy activity.\" So he held off for a while until one day he discovered a \"baggie\" near his home with an intriguing black widow spider design. He picked it up and began what he now calls, the \"Discarded Drug Baggies\" project. \nGiannopoulos had a goal in mind to create a series that was more focused on art than his traditional reportage work.\n\"This project was as much, if not more, about the beauty I saw in these little bits of trash as it was about what they represented,\" said Giannopoulos, a 35-year-old photographer based in London. \n\"This is first and foremost a project intended to make something aesthetically engaging from pieces of trash that the general public are mostly unaware of. To me they are really interesting pieces of street art that are loaded with meaning and questions. They're almost like tags of drug users. Or minute markers of an addiction made public.\" \n'One man's trash is another man's treasure'\nWhen he finds a baggie, Giannopoulos plots the exact location on a map in an attempt to chart patterns of drug use across the city. He focuses on areas close to where he lives, on the outskirts of London and South East London. \nMost baggies are found in poor areas, but he also finds baggies in wealthier areas with large, open public spaces. He has discovered baggies in parks, near bars and nightclubs, and even next to schools and playgrounds. \nAfter he collects a baggie, Giannopoulos photographs it against a white background. \n\"I like the term 'One man's trash is another man's treasure,' \" he said.\nDuring his three years of hunting for drug baggies, Giannopoulos has found 67 variations of designs and graphics. He wanted to map the baggies to see whether there were any patterns connecting different designs to certain locations, but he hasn't found those links yet.\n\"Some designs would stop appearing and other new designs would take their place from year to year,\" he said. \"There isn't an area that has more Bob Marley baggies than Union Jack baggies.\"\nThe most prominent baggies are the ones with leaf designs, bulldogs, machine guns and plain bags with a green reseal strip.\nMaking the invisible, visible\nGiannopoulos is passionately curious about the underlying stories of these dirty, discarded baggies.\n\"There are a number of ways that you can read into these artifacts,\" he said. \"Whether that is questioning where they came from, the journey they took to get where I found them, what was in them, who it was that consumed the contents. What was their story? Are they a casual, social user or is their story one of dependency? And you can also ask bigger questions about public drug use in London.\"\nGiannopoulos says most of the baggies he finds allude to or contain obvious remnants of marijuana. This isn't surprising, since cannabis is the most commonly used drug in England, according to national statistics from the \n2014 to 2015 Crime Survey for England and Wales\n (PDF). \nHe also notes that many of the designs on the baggies relate to weed in some way.\n\"They'll either have a cannabis leaf displayed somewhere in the design, or will have something that is in the design that is synonymous with cannabis culture, for example Bob Marley or lips with a joint,\" he said.\nHis intended end result for the project was to create a large digital collage of all the baggies to illustrate drug culture in London and the ubiquitous baggies that symbolize these illicit acts. He never had a particular number in mind, but when he recently finished the project, the final total was ironically, and entirely unintentionally, 420 baggies.\nGiannopoulos is working with the \nBen Oakley Gallery\n, a commercial art venue in South East London, to create an exhibition that will be displayed this June. \n\"London is really no different to any other big city. There are plenty of drug users -- public and private. I think that this project has made some people more aware of these baggies,\" he said.\n\"In a way, it has made something that was always there but invisible, now visible. I've had people tell me that prior to seeing the project they had never seen one of these baggies before, and now they see them everywhere.\"", "Drawing upon your own life experiments": "We are kicking bad habits, searching for happiness, improving relationships, saving the planet, advancing our careers, getting in shape and so on. Or at least trying to, by\n \nconverting our thoughts into action and then trying over and over again until we discover what works (and doesn't). \"All life is an experiment,\" wrote the science-minded transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson. \"The more experiments you make, the better.\"\nLife itself is an experiment, but you can turn up the heat on that Bunsen burner by concocting your own DIY experiments toward various short- and long-term objectives. I personally have about a half dozen going at any given time, which is probably too many, but good fodder for Wisdom Project columns.\nThe spoils of long-term commitment\nOne of my longest is the choice I made to become vegetarian 20 Thanksgivings ago. The only other idea or project I've committed to longer has been keeping a journal (26 years and counting).\nA longitudinal experiment that spans decades has unique challenges and rewards. The challenge is sticking to it, not just in moments when it's a struggle, but also during periods when you lose touch with its value or purpose. The rewards come later, sometimes subtly and unexpectedly, so you have to keep faith in them in the absence of short-term payoffs. There's no easy hack for this. The closest I've come up with is revisiting the initial reasons for my choice and, when that doesn't work, sticking with it anyway. \nThis theory is often referred to as \"deliberate practice\" and research has linked it to success in \nmedicine\n, \nsports\n, \nspelling bees\n, \nchess\n and \nplaying the piano\n. Simply persevering and \nsticking to any long-term goal\n has the added benefit of increasing the likelihood of general success. It's more predictive than IQ or talent. You may even be able to extrapolate that the benefits of long-term dedication to a goal or ideal are akin to benefits of a long-term, committed relationship, which research ties to a greater sense of \nlife satisfaction and happiness\n.\nRelated: Backcasting to the future\nSticking with vegetarianism for two decades has taught me a lot -- about myself, about ethics, food, culture and even human nature. Some lessons took years to reveal themselves. What started as a simple and surprisingly easy ethical choice has been a portal of growth and self-improvement when it pushes me outside my comfort zone. \nMake the action itself the goal\nMost of our experiments (resolutions, mantras, lifehacks, diets, new habits, etc.) have some end goal in mind. But despite the worth of those goals, we often don't stick with them. New Year's resolutions, research has shown us, have a discouraging \n8% success rate\n, with more than half given up by summer. \nSo part of the secret of a long-term commitment is not thinking of it as a means to an end, but as the goal itself. Instead of focusing on losing 15 pounds, make two hours of exercise every week the commitment. By staying resolved to that week after week, the weight loss will follow, along with more energy, better sleep and perhaps a longer life.\n \nSome commitments bring less predictable outcomes. In a fascinating TED Talk, \n\"planet walker\" John Francis \nreflected on unexpected lessons in environmentalism and education over 30 years of refusing to take motorized transportation, and an overlapping 17-year long vow of silence. \"Leave behind the security of who we've become,\" Francis says, \"and go to the place of who we are becoming.\"\nHaving a self-improvement goal be the action itself is\n often more successful\n than trying to reach an objective. The Japanese have a business philosophy that sums up this concept of small changes, over a long period, leading to big change: \nkaizan\n. And if the idea -- or person, or religious faith -- to which you are committing, is good and pure, it follows that the outcomes eventually will be, too.\nVegetarianism: Day one, year one\nI started my two-decade-long pursuit by giving a lecture at Thanksgiving dinner 1995. \"To quote George Bernard Shaw,\" I told my assembled family, \"'Animals are my friends ... and I don't eat my friends.' \" My grand pronouncement was met with groans, communal eye-rolls, and my father's prediction that I'd be chomping on a turkey leg a year later.\nParental gauntlets are their own motivation (that's perhaps another column), but what really pushed me to commit initially was a column I wrote for my college newspaper two days before. In it, I pledged my vegetarianism, knowing that by putting it in print, I was throwing down my own gauntlet and that I'd have to follow through or live as a hypocrite.  \nAs my Thanksgiving toast/lecture suggests, I was rather insufferable back then. My poor college roommates endured mealtime soliloquies on the environmental and ethical implications of their dining habits. I may have been convincing myself more than trying to convert them, but either way, I made for an obnoxious dinner companion those early months. \nThat was my first lesson: You convince no one of anything by putting them on the defensive. John Francis stopped speaking, in part, because he was tired of defending his choice not to ride in cars. These days, I deflect the debate. Sometimes people genuinely want to engage in the ethics of my choice -- though I've noticed this happens a lot less than it used to -- and I'll often say, \"I'm happy to talk about it, but I've learned that vegetarianism makes for terrible dinner conversation.\"\nI'm grateful for the debate, however. It adds resolve, but also nuance to my reasoning. I recognize now that most people have thoughtful, at times conflicted, reasons for their food choices. My own ethical logic to vegetarianism should lead me toward veganism, maybe even fruitarianism. But I still eat eggs and cheese and wear leather shoes, and don't mind trying to defend that arbitrary line.\nYears two to 20\nThere have been long stretches when I've been out of touch with the reasons for my dietary mandate, but grateful I stuck to it anyway. Other times, I've been forced to consider my choice out of inconvenience, usually when traveling in countries where meat-free options are harder to come by. Rural Mongolia was a steady diet of rice porridge with raisins, salty vegetables, fermented mare's milk and vodka. I didn't fair much better in Morocco and parts of Spain.\nRelated: Success path rarely travels a straight line\nAnd before we had our first child, my wife (who enthusiastically eats all manner of animals) and I had to sort out how to raise her, diet-wise. All parents make this decision, and base it on their own philosophy of food, but it was an opportunity to re-question my own belief about why vegetarianism mattered.\nIt's not a radical or even difficult commitment I've made, and its impact on others and the planet is a miniscule part of a larger progressive movement with environmental, ethical and consumer repercussions. But it has changed me, slowly and subtly, for the better.\nMaybe one day I'll start eating meat again. I do miss the taste of some of it, especially crab, the staple of my hometown of Baltimore. Or maybe I'll stick with it until the end (which may come \nyears later \njust by staying meat-free). I do know the longer I continue the experiment, the more I learn. So I think I'll stick with it for another decade or two and see if anything else surfaces.

Manzone is at risk of Huntington's disease, a hereditary illness that has robbed many of his relatives of fruitful lives. At only 32, he has lost aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. The disease is believed to be the reason two of his relatives committed suicide.\nFor years, he prayed it wouldn't affect his immediate family. Maybe, just maybe, they'd be in the clear.\nOn May 15, 2012, Manzone called his mother, Debbie Franczek, with exciting news. His wife, Danielle, was pregnant again. \nThe joy was short-lived. Later that day, Franczek was diagnosed with Huntington's disease. It is slowly killing her.\nLiving with Huntington's\nA year before, the family started noticing changes in Franczek's mood, behaviors, speech and gait. She'd slur words as she was speaking and jerk uncontrollably. Her moods were unpredictable at best. \n\"We knew exactly what it was,\" says Manzone, who lives in upstate New York.\nThe symptoms of Huntington's disease can be similar to those of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's simultaneously. The Huntington's Disease Society of America reports that there are about 30,000 symptomatic Americans and more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease today.\nKevin Biglan, professor of neurology at the University of Rochester and director of the Huntington's society's Center of Excellence, has treated patients with Huntington's disease for much of his career. \n\"It varies dramatically across individuals,\" Biglan says of the neurodegenerative disease. \"Brain cells dysfunction and progressively die over a period of decades.\" \nAccording to Biglan, patients with the fatal disease experience a slow progression of symptoms over a 10- to 25-year period. \"You can imagine if you are 25 years old, you may not have symptoms for 25 to 30 years,\" Biglan says. \"It can create quite a bit of anxiety among individuals. It doesn't give you much predicted value.\"\nManzone remembers the way his mom used to embrace tradition in her household -- and how much she cared. \"She would take me to New York City every year for my birthday,\" he says. \nFor the devout Catholic and single mother of two, church was not an option; it was mandatory. Every Sunday, she'd gather Manzone and his sister, Chelsea, for Mass and family dinner. \nSince she was diagnosed with Huntington's disease, Franczek's personality has slipped away, along with the traditions she once set forward. \"She doesn't go to church anymore,\" Manzone says. \"In her words: God wouldn't do this to me.\"\nFranczek stopped attending church right around the time she said goodbye to a job she cherished for 25 years. At just 48 years old, after spending her entire career as a dietary clerk at a local hospital, she could no longer mask the symptoms of the haunted genetic disorder. Manzone too worked at the hospital, where they had lunch together every week.\n\"It was an emotional goodbye,\" he recalls.\nThese days, life is a lot different for the entire family.\nFranczek is no longer capable of completing basic tasks. Even writing a card is too much. She takes various medications to help manage the jerking, depression and personality changes. Her diet is limited because swallowing is difficult. Her speech is broken, so she can't properly communicate her thoughts. \n\"She has lost all drive,\" Manzone says. \"She knows there's no cure, and she's accepted the fact that she will just get worse and worse.\"  \nFranczek couldn't even hold her granddaughter the day she was born in 2013. Manzone feared she'd accidentally drop her.\nTo test, or not to test?\nNone of this rings uncommon to Amy Chesire, a social worker for New York state, who has worked with Huntington's disease patients for 25 years. Both Chesire and Biglan believe that with new therapies, support groups and the right treatment plan, patients don't tend to see the disease in such monstrous terms. \n\"I think sometimes calling it a death sentence gives too much power to this disease,\" Chesire says. \nIn the same respect, Chesire and Biglan acknowledge that the disease brings a financial burden to many families -- and that it ultimately causes death. Most commonly, patients die from pneumonia, falling, suicide or blood clots or infections resulting from progressive immobility, Biglan says.\nMatt and Danielle Manzone now help watch over his 17-year-old sister, Chelsea, who still lives with their mother. Like Matt, Chelsea has a 50% risk of carrying the faulty gene. If either of the siblings were diagnosed with Huntington's disease, the same would be true for any of their children. \nAlthough the question continues to haunt Manzone, he has decided not to get tested. The only two things that would change his mind: If he started showing symptoms or if a cure is discovered. \nHis sister is of a similar mindset but remains open to the possibility down the road. \nMatt and Danielle Manzone made the choice years ago to have children without testing. They now have Giovanni, 6, and Milania, 3. \n\"To say I'm scared is an understatement,\" Manzone says. \"I worry for myself. I worry for my wife. I worry that I will one day leave her a widow and our children without a father because of this disease.\"\nBut still, he stands by his decision, although not everyone accepts it so easily.\n\"People have asked us, 'Why did you even have children?' \" Danielle says. \"It's such a personal question. So he's not allowed to experience fatherhood because a terrible disease runs in his family?\"\nIf there's something everyone can agree on -- Biglan, Chesire and the Manzones -- it's that there's no right or wrong answer. Getting tested or pursuing a treatment plan is personal to each individual at risk of the disease. \nManzone's focus remains staying strong for his family and taking care of his mother, as her need for care becomes more constant. \n\"She was outside recently, and I overheard Giovanni say, 'Grandma, does Mom know you're out here by yourself?' \" Danielle says. \"He knows something is not right.\"\nThe Manzones choose to take everything day by day, but Matt knows he may, one day, end up like his mother.\n\"If I do ever develop the symptoms and get diagnosed with Huntington's disease, I know I am going to fight like hell,\" he says.", "What happens when you go without sugar for 10 days?": "By cutting back sugar for your kids, \nyou can see dramatic improvements in just 10 days.\n That is pretty remarkable, if you think about it. \nWe typically think diets take months, or even longer, to make a positive dent. For 43 children, however, \nDr. Robert Lustig\n and his team at University of California, San Francisco, decreased triglyceride levels by 33 points on average. The LDL -- bad -- cholesterol dropped 5 points, as did \ndiastolic blood pressure, the lower number\n.\nAll of the children dramatically reduced their risk of diabetes, as their blood sugar and insulin levels normalized. Again, just 10 days. And while the study was done in children, there's no reason to believe the benefits wouldn't extend to adults, as well.\nIt speaks to what was once an unspeakable idea -- in fact, all calories are not created equal. \nAs much as we love the simple accounting principles of calorie counting, there are some calories that are simply worse than others, and for most people, sugar is at the top of the list. The table sugar most people know is sucrose, made up of equal parts glucose and fructose. But it is the fructose that is such a bad actor, Lustig told me. The reason why is really fascinating.\nBecause our bodies use glucose as the preferred energy source, it is easily metabolized and used just about everywhere and the extra is stored in our muscles or liver as glycogen.\nUnfortunately, this is not the case with fructose, which is metabolized in only one place -- the liver. And, because the liver can only handle so much fructose at a time, the extra gets converted into fat. Your liver starts to accumulate fat, which is wildly unhealthy. Even worse, the excess fat spills out into your blood stream, increasing your risk of heart disease and strokes.\nIn ancient times, before sugar and high fructose corn syrup (which are basically the same) became so cheap to refine and produce, we only got our fructose in small amounts, when fruit fell from the trees. Heck, even honey was protected by the bees. \nNowadays, however, we consume 130 pounds a year -- or roughly 1/3 of a pound every day. Our livers, however, have not evolved to keep pace with the staggering increase. As a result, a sugary drink hits your liver like a tsunami wave, according to Lustig.\nThere is something else peculiar about fructose: Unlike other sources of calories, it doesn't suppress the hunger hormone, known as ghrelin. So, despite eating lots of it, you don't really feel full. \nThe result: you keep eating. In addition, fructose targets my favorite area of the brain, the nucleus accumbens, also known as the reward center. Turns out fructose gives the nucleus accumbens a little nudge, resulting in someone feeling rewarded, good, even euphoric, and -- you guessed it -- wanting to eat even more. \nLustig and his team wanted to make something very clear in this study. \nWhile many diet studies derive most of their benefit from people simply eating less, it wasn't the case here. While study participants reduced their dietary sugar from 28% to 10%, it was replaced with other complex carbohydrates. Think bagels instead of pastries. The goal was not to lose weight but to isolate the impact of sugar on the body. \nSo, hide the extra Halloween candy from your kids and yourself. At our home, \nthe Switch Witch\n will pay a visit within a week after Halloween. She takes the candy and leaves something special in its place. (We still haven't decided what she's leaving this year.)\nHowever you cut back, you now know your body will thank you for it in as little as 10 days.", "Researchers explore the science of awe": "Accounts of awe abound in the arts and humanities, but it wasn't until relatively recently that psychologists have begun to explore the phenomenon in depth. In 2003, researchers Jonathan Haidt and Dacher Keltner published a landmark study on the social and emotional functions of awe, reporting that it appeared to increase people's feelings of connectedness and willingness to help others.\n\"The consequences of awe should be of interest to emotion researchers and to society in general,\" they wrote in the study, published in the journal \nCognition and Emotion\n. \"Awe-inducing events may be one of the fastest and most powerful methods of personal change and growth.\"\nThe importance of losing yourself to awe\nMore recently, a team of researchers (including Haidt) built on this research in a new paper exploring the psychology of the \"overview effect,\" published earlier this year in the journal Psychology of Consciousness. The overview effect \u2014 the profound reaction astronauts experience when viewing the Earth from space \u2014 was first coined in 1987 by psychologist Frank White, who published a book of the same title. In his research, White found that many of the astronauts had undergone \"truly transformative experiences including senses of wonder and awe, unity with nature, transcendence and universal brotherhood.\"\nSince the first humans were launched into space, plenty of cases of the overview effect have been documented, but researchers have devoted little attention to examining exactly how it works. Inspired by White's work, David Yaden, a University of Pennsylvania psychology research fellow and the lead author of this latest paper, set out to examine two questions about the effect: First, what is it? And, second, is there a way to use its emotional power in other contexts?\nIn addition to surveying existing research on self-transcendental experiences, Yaden and his colleagues analyzed astronauts' accounts of their experiences \u2014 like this one from a NASA astronaut \nidentified as Kathryn D.\n, about the first time she saw the Earth from space:\n\"It's hard to explain how amazing and magical this experience is. First of all, there's the astounding beauty and diversity of the planet itself, scrolling across your view at what appears to be a smooth, stately pace ... I'm happy to report that no amount of prior study or training can fully prepare anybody for the awe and wonder this inspires.\"\nOr this one, from the \nGerman cosmonaut Sigmund Jahn\n:\n\"Before I flew I was already aware how small and vulnerable our planet is; but only when I saw it from space, in all its ineffable beauty and fragility, did I realize that humankind's most urgent task is to cherish and preserve it for future generations.\"\nA sense of wonder may be good for your health\nBoth descriptions, Yaden explains, contain the two main components of awe. The first is perceptual vastness, or being confronted with something of striking physical magnitude, \"like seeing the Grand Canyon.\" The second is conceptual vastness, \"which is like a mind-blowing idea,\" he says.\nPast research has shown that awestruck experiences like the ones the astronauts described appear to have psychological benefits, especially relating to altruism. In their paper, Yaden and his colleagues summarized the link between awe and unselfishness. \nOne 2012 study\n, for example, found that awe \"caused people to perceive that they had more time available and lessened impatience\" \u2014 a social bonding effect that may also have conferred an evolutionary advantage, helping our ancestors to survive.\n\"Basically, evolutionarily, groups that were able to induce more experiences like awe were more cohesive,\" Yaden explains, \"and thus cooperated better, and thus more effectively, than other groups who had less awe.\"\nHow neuroscientists explain the mind-clearing magic of running\nWhile these studies make a compelling case for awe's benefits, it's a tricky thing to study, largely because the data rely on somewhat subjective self-reporting criteria. Some past research has supplemented participants' descriptions with facial analysis, though that too is far from exact. (An awed face, generally speaking, will have raised inner eyebrows; widened eyes; an open, slightly drop-jawed mouth; visible inhalation; and a head jutted slightly forward.)\nTo understand awe more comprehensively, Andrew Newberg, another of the paper's co-authors and a neuroscientist at Thomas Jefferson University, has been studying the physiological \nunderpinnings\n of self-transcendent experiences like meditation and prayer. His research, which uses techniques like \ntranscranial direct stimulation\n, \nSPECT imaging\n, and \nfMRIs\n, suggests awe may be \"felt\" by the autonomic nervous system, which controls both our arousal and our calming (fight-or-flight) mechanisms.\n\"Normally, one side of the autonomic nervous system comes on and the other shuts down,\" he says, \"but in very intense spiritual experiences and practices like meditation and prayer, there's evidence to show they mutually turn on at the same time. I think the feeling of awe is the combination of both.\"\nHe points to the brain's parietal lobe, which contributes to our spatial sense of self and orients us in the physical world \u2014 and appears to shut down in awe experiences. \"The decrease of activity in that area is going to be associated with a loss of the sense of self, and a loss of the boundary between the self and other things in the world, and ultimately a sense of oneness and connectedness,\" he says.\nCurrently, Yaden and his colleagues are studying ways to foster that feeling of connectedness \u2014 specifically, they're looking into projects that could allow civilians to experience the overview effect, through techniques like virtual reality or a planetarium. Other possible collaborations could include companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic. \"The whole space tourism industry ... is essentially selling the overview effect,\" Yaden says. \"You're not doing science up there. You're there for the experience.\" In the meantime, there's plenty of awe to be found here on Earth.\nThis story originally appeared on \nScience of Us\n.", "Cell phone radiation increases cancers in rats, but should we worry?": "Part of the problem is that studying people is less controlled than testing animals in labs. Researchers have asked individuals diagnosed with brain tumors to recall how much they used their cell phones and compared it with usage by healthy people, but it can be hard for people to accurately remember their use. Other studies have followed healthy people for years to see whether those who use their phones the most develop more cancers, and while they have not found that to be the case, heavy users could differ in other ways that affect their cancer risk.\nTo get around these challenges, some researchers have turned to rodents. They expose mice or rats to known doses of radiation that are equivalent to -- or sometimes more than -- what people get from their cell phones.\nIn the \nlatest rodent study\n (PDF), released Friday, researchers at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences gave rats high doses of radiation every day for two years and compared them with rats that did not receive radiation. The researchers looked at how many animals developed tumors in the brain and in nerve cells of the heart.\nThe researchers found that 2% to 3% of the hundreds of male rats that were irradiated developed brain tumors, compared with none of the control rats. The number of female rats that developed these cancers was smaller, about 1% of the animals, and could have been due to chance. Similarly, between 2% and 7% of the irradiated male rats developed heart tumors, compared with only about 2% of the irradiated female rats and none of the control rats.\n\"Our report outlines small increases in tumors of male rats,\" said John R. Bucher, associate director of the National Toxicology Program and one of the researchers involved in the new report. He explained that the tumors were \"of types similar to those\" in other research that found radiofrequency from cell phones is a \npossible carcinogen\n (PDF). \nHowever, \"much work remains to be done to understand the implications of these findings, if any, for the rapidly changing use of cell phone technology today,\" Bucher said. For the time being, he is still using his cell phone, putting it next to his head or wearing earbuds, depending on what he is doing.\n'It may raise more questions than it answers'\nThe\n bulk of the research\n on this topic has not found a link between cell phone radiation and tumor risk, although the possibility had not been ruled out, said Salvatore Insinga, a neurosurgeon at Northwell Health's Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, New York. \nBecause of the unusual findings in the new study, \"it may raise more questions than it answers,\" Insinga said. Nevertheless, it suggests that researchers should double down on studying the possible cancer link, he added.\nFor now, Insinga said, there are not enough data to advise people to cut their cell phone use or to use earbuds. The Federal Communications Commission states that people could reduce their exposure to cell phone radiation by using an earpiece or headset when they talk, and by keeping the device away from their bodies. However, the agency falls short of endorsing these practices and states that \"\nno scientific evidence currently establishes\n a definite link between wireless device use and cancer.\"\nOne of the conundrums with the current study is that, for reasons unclear to the researchers, rats in the control group did not live as long as the rats that received radiation. \"If rats are living longer, the chance statistically is increased they will get cancer,\" Insinga said. \nSeveral researchers provided feedback as part of the study and echoed this concern. \"It is puzzling why the control [rats] had short survival rate,\" one researcher wrote. If these animals had lived as long as the irradiated rats, he added, they might have developed brain and heart tumors at similar rates. The rate that rats develop brain and heart tumors, even without receiving radiation, is typically 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively.\nIt is also unclear why the male rats in the study developed more cancer than the females. Bucher noted that studies in rats generally find males to be more susceptible to developing tumors, but the few studies in people that observed a link between cell phone use and cancer risk did not find gender differences.\nThe third conundrum is whether the animals received too much radiation. The lowest dose the animals received was 1.5 watts per kilogram, just below the limit of \n1.6 watts per kilogram\n set by the Federal Communications Commission for the amount of energy the body can absorb. However, the animals were exposed to this amount of radiation over their entire bodies nine hours a day for two years. \nThe rationale for using this amount of radiation is that people could be using their cell phones more and more in the future, and the radiation emitted by newer cell phones and cellular networks could increase, Bucher said. \"We wanted to make sure we captured future use,\" he said. \nThe researchers also chose to expose the rats' entire bodies to radiation to mimic the situation with people who hold their cell phones on different parts of their bodies, Bucher said.\nPrevious research in rodents has found that exposing animals to cell phone radiation across their entire bodies for only \nan hour a day\n or \nsix hours a day\n for a shorter number of days did not lead to increases in the rates of lymphomas and brain tumors, respectively. \nAction item: More research\nThe value of the new study is really to strengthen the biological possibility that cell phone radiation could cause cancer, said Jonathan M. Samet, chairman of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, who led the World Health Organization panel in 2011 that \ndetermined\n cell phone use is a possible cancer risk.\n\"It really signals the need for a more integrated research agenda than we have had and to try to get a better mechanistic understanding,\" Samet said.\nSome researchers have \ndismissed\n the possibility that cell phone radiation could cause cancer, because it is non-ionizing and does not carry enough energy to damage DNA like the ionizing radiation in X-rays and CT scans does. Hopefully, animal studies can help shed light on how non-ionizing radiation could be increasing cancer risk, Samet said. \nThe current report is the first of two installments of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study. The second report, which should be released in the fall of 2017, will include data from mice as well as rats and will look at rates of cancers in other organs and tissue types. ", "After devastating accident, woman gets back in the saddle": "She slowly slips her right leg -- a prosthetic limb of metal and plastic tucked into a brown leather boot -- over the massive animal and freezes, half on, half off the saddle. For several minutes, all she hears is the pitter-patter of chilly February raindrops on the barn roof mixed with the pulsing sound of her own heart racing. \nIt was 10 months ago that Fuggetta was last on horseback -- when mounting a horse was simply a matter of grabbing the reins, throwing her foot into a stirrup and swinging herself over the saddle. With a light kick, she and her white-and-red-spotted horse, Sammy, would be off, galloping down a forest trail or traipsing through the scenery of rural Oregon.\nUnable to shift her weight onto the horse, terrified of leaving the ground, she looks to her side toward her friend, who holds the horse's reins and tells her it's time to make a decision. \"Get on or get off.\" \nA tragic accident\nA self-described \"animal nut,\" the 27-year-old once spent much of her free time in the saddle, riding with Sammy through open fields in the company of her friends and their horses. Often in tow was her pit bull, Tina, who joined them at the barn or came along for hikes through mountainside trails or under forest canopies. Her Facebook newsfeed was a proud barrage of pictures of Tina and Sammy and their adventures together. \"Anyone who knew me knew how much I loved my animals,\" Fuggetta said.\nOn a balmy day in August, a devastating accident dramatically changed the course of Fuggetta's life. She and several friends, all on horseback, left the barn and were headed to a nearby restaurant when a driver barreled into her and Sammy. \nThe impact sent them flying. Fuggetta landed in a drainage ditch, her leg bent behind her, almost torn from the socket. She called out for Sammy repeatedly, but the horse had died instantly. \nDoctors amputated the leg below the knee. They told her she faced a long, arduous road to recovery, full of surgeries and multiple skin grafts. They assured her she'd regain mobility but would have to relearn how to walk. She said none of it compared to the pain of losing Sammy.\n\"I'd never really cried about the fact that I lost my leg. It never really felt like something that I couldn't get over,\" Fuggetta said. \"Losing my leg was like I had lost something. But losing Sammy, that was like losing someone.\"\nA few days after her accident, tragedy struck again. Groggy from pain medicine, Fuggetta sat up in her hospital bed as her mother entered the room, hugged her and took her hand. \"Tina's gone,\" her mother said. Her beloved pit bull had died suddenly after an undetectable mass on her liver erupted.\nStunned, Fuggetta sat back and began to sob. \"I just didn't understand. Tina had nothing to do with any of it,\" she said. In the course of one week, she had lost her leg and both of her animals. \n\"I had been a rider and an animal mom, and those aspects of my life were a huge part of my identity,\" Fuggetta said. \"It was like I had lost everything that made me who I am.\"\nFinding a new normal \nFor the first few painful weeks bound to a hospital bed, Fuggetta would spend some nights crying, achingly frustrated with grief. But during the day, surrounded by friends, she said, she never felt hopeless. With an outpouring of support from her fellow riders, family and even acquaintances, she was overwhelmed with love.\nHer hospital room filled with flowers, books, cards and tributes to her late animals. Friends from the equestrian community would hang pictures of her animals on the wall and brought stuffed horses that resembled hers. Other friends made collages and scrapbooks covered with pictures of her pets. A friend of a friend even sent her a watercolor portrait of Sammy. \n\"I think posting about my animals every day on Facebook made other people feel like they knew them too,\" Fuggetta said. \nThe support never waned during Fuggetta's month in the hospital, followed by more time at an inpatient rehabilitation center. At any given time, the desk in her room was covered with a variety of paper cups from friends who would stop in to bring her coffee and chat. It was her community, she said, that saved her from despair. \n\"They let me feel the loss but also got me to picture my life in the future and realize that this was an interruption, not a fundamental change to who I had been,\" she said.\nAs time passed, she began to feel more like herself again. She got to know the other patients around her, involved herself in the clinic's activities and decorated her room to resemble the bedroom she had back home. She insisted that her friends bring their pets along to visit her and one day turned the rehab clinic into an impromptu petting zoo as the facility allowed a team of miniature horses to visit.\n\"She was always having fun,\" said Jean Powrie, a physical therapist who worked with her. \"I think her attitude was a big part of why she healed so well. She never gave up, and it was amazing to see.\"\nOn Halloween, Fuggetta tied a gag gift -- a fake plastic severed leg -- to her wheelchair. \nFrom there, Fuggetta's mission became finding a new normal. Three months after her accident, she moved back home with a wheelchair. Two months later, she was fitted for a prosthetic limb, which she practiced walking on every day. At some point, she expects to be back on her own two feet, with the help of what she calls her \"robot leg\"; it's just a matter of time. \nSoon after she returned home, Fuggetta welcomed a new dog into her life: K.J., a 55-pound, one-eared brown pit bull who was rescued from a dogfighting ring in northern Florida. Fuggetta wrote proudly on her Facebook page, \"We're both missing a piece.\" \nEventually she returned to work, tending to the children's section at a Portland bookstore. She admitted that she's limited in what she can do on the job. She can't reshelve books or quickly move around the aisles. But she wouldn't give up. To allow the accident to disrupt her work life \"was a lot more power than I wanted to give it.\"\nThere was another place where she needed to return: the barn. Though her chest tightened each time she passed Sammy's empty stall, she was grateful to be a part of her equestrian community again, around horses and the owners who were like family. \nBut there was something missing.\n\"The world wasn't going to be quite right until I rode again,\" she said. \nBack in the saddle \nIt's February in the barn.  Fuggetta's right leg is planted on the ground, and her prosthetic leg dangles over the horse's back. She knows she must decide whether now is the time. As desperate as she is to reclaim a fundamental part of her identity and get back into the saddle, she's also terrified. Can she trust this horse to carry her through? Can she trust her body in this new, more challenging form? \nFuggetta glances around at the dozen or so people around her who are cheering for her. She takes a deep breath, shifts her weight onto the horse and picks her foot up into the stirrup. With a light kick, she and the horse move forward into a trot, riding circles around the arena. \nSmiling, she grips the reins and relaxes into the seat of the saddle, grateful to be on horseback again. ", "It terrorized millions; now one man is close to killing it": "The dead Guinea worm has been there for most of Hopkins' tough slog against a disease that he is finally on the verge of vanquishing. \nHe doesn't know why he called her Henrietta except that he might have thought of a Dutch princess by that name. But Henrietta inspires Hopkins to soldier on. She reminds him of the resilience of people who have experienced the excruciating scourge of Guinea worm, a water-borne parasitic disease that culminates with milky white worms bursting from festering blisters on human skin. \nSoon, Hopkins hopes, Henrietta will be the last of her kind.\n\"My passion,\" he says, lifting the jar off the shelf, \"is to see the end of this worm.\"\nIt has been a passion, as well, for former President Jimmy Carter. Last August, when Carter announced to the world that he was battling brain cancer, he expressed this wish: \"I hope Guinea worm dies before I do.\"\nThat wish may very well come true. \nCarter has been declared cancer free. And Guinea worm cases now number 22, down from 3.5 million in 1986, \nwhen the Carter Center tapped Hopkins to lead the global eradication effort. \nBack then, Guinea worm terrorized people in 21 countries. Today, the remaining cases are limited to isolated parts of Chad, Mali, South Sudan and Ethiopia. \nGuinea worm never commanded attention like malaria or polio. Perhaps that's because the disease --  aptly known in Latin as \ndracunculiasis\n or \"little snake\" --  was not indigenous to the West and mainly affects people in African and Asian nations with poor water sanitation. Perhaps it's also because Guinea worm is generally not a killer. It still can be devastating: It is so painful and disabling that it often keeps impoverished men and women from working for months or even years, and children from attending school. \n\"We've kept 80 million people from having Guinea worm, and now we are approaching the end of the process,\" Carter says. \"I would say this is perhaps the most gratifying personal experience I have had in the so-called successes of my life.\"\nFor that reason, Carter calls Hopkins a hero. \nHopkins' quest to succeed began early in life. Few things faze him, and a pathological (that's the word his colleagues use) optimism has buoyed him through formidable challenges.\nBut the disease doctor has learned to temper his excitement in what has been a long and weary fight against Guinea worm. Several target dates for eradication have come and gone and Hopkins knows that even now, on the precipice of victory, a setback could happen. All it takes is for one sick person to contaminate a water supply and an entire village can become infected.\n\"That's one of the things that keeps me up at night,\" Hopkins says. \"The worm has a prolific reproductive cycle.\" \nHopkins, who will turn 75 this September, hopes he will be around to see the World Health Organization declare Guinea worm dead. \n\"God willing. I take great satisfaction in knowing that this worm will be gone.\"\nAnd when it is, Hopkins, will be in a class of his own. \nEradicating an infectious disease is no small task. Only one other human disease has ever been stamped out: smallpox in 1980. Hopkins, who worked for many years at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, played a key role in that effort as well.\nNow he stands to accomplish a public health feat as the man who killed two horrific diseases.\nFrom Miami to Mali\nOn this wintry day in the Windy City, the white stuff is blowing sideways. Hopkins uses a broom to clear the wooden steps leading to his front door for his CNN visitors.  \nHe moved here to be closer to his wife Ernestine's family and for a while commuted to work at the Carter Center in Atlanta. As the center's special adviser on Guinea worm, Hopkins, a 1995 MacArthur \"genius\" grant recipient, now wages war on the worm from a small office equipped with a laptop, a land line and a fax machine. He doesn't have a cell phone; nor does he care much for e-mail. He thought his pager annoying during his medical internship at San Francisco General, and his dislike for such devices has only grown. \"Distractions,\" he calls them. \nHopkins' Victorian-era townhouse near Lincoln Park is embellished with things he's collected throughout his career. They add up, like pieces of a puzzle, to reveal a man of many distinctions: a black man who succeeded despite the obstacles of racial injustice. A man who delves deep into whatever captures his interest.\nThere's a small idol of Sitala Devi, the Hindu goddess who protects from smallpox, and an award plaque with pump handles on it in honor of John Snow, who traced a 19th century cholera outbreak in London to a single contaminated water pump and is considered the father of modern epidemiology. \nHopkins owns an old Brooklyn Dodgers pennant (because of barrier-breaker Jackie Robinson) and a Lion of Judah flag (because he was impressed with Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie). \nHe framed a certificate of his 1998 knighthood in Mali. Among his many books is his own, \n\"The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History,\"\n which earned him a Pulitzer nomination. And on top of his bookshelf is a collection of blue bottles, most of them antique medical vials and one empty bottle of the Luna di Luna wine he shared with Ernestine on a vacation to one of their favorite spots, Martha's Vineyard. \"I like the color blue,\" Hopkins says. \nHe also likes orchids. A customer on his childhood paper route brought back the delicate flowers from the Everglades, and Hopkins realized then that they were so much more than corsages. He wishes he could have a greenhouse at home to grow them in Chicago's weather. \nBut perhaps most striking are the myriad pictures and carvings of woodpeckers. His fondness for the birds began as a young boy when he glimpsed a pair of pileated woodpeckers the size of pigeons in an oak tree at his grandmother's house. He was taken by their red crests, unusual posture and loping flights.\nLater, in Nigeria, Hopkins learned that the Yoruba concept of ashe, or the power to make things happen, was symbolized by a woodpecker. He recognizes exemplary work by his team members by sending notes rubber-stamped with a woodpecker image, a gesture coveted like a Nobel Prize at the Carter Center.\nAll these years later, Hopkins recognizes his fascination seems fitting: Woodpeckers are persistent at picking off worms.\nPhotographs of his parents and family hang in the hall outside his second-floor office. Hopkins traced the genealogy of his Bahamian ancestors and credits his parents for giving him the right start in life. \nHe was one of 10 children born to Joseph Leonard Hopkins, a carpenter who built three family homes, and Iva Louise Hopkins, a seamstress who made all her children's clothes. The family lived in the Bahamian section of Coconut Grove in  Miami. \nUnder Jim Crow, the city was strictly segregated and built concrete walls to keep blacks out of white areas. Hopkins remembers black kids never got the new shiny things white kids got. He rode on rickety school buses, sat at scratched-up desks and read second-hand textbooks.\n\"In that day and age, to raise 10 black children and have them stay out of trouble and have most graduate from college was a big deal,\" he says. \"I didn't understand how much my parents sacrificed for us.\"\nHe can't say that segregation touched his life in a sinister way. \"It was just the way things were,\" he says. But later in life, the experiences of his youth informed his work chasing disease from the Ganges Delta to the jungles of Ghana.\nHis mother often made her children recite multiplication tables while she sat with her foot on the pedal of her sewing machine and read out the poem, \"Don't Quit\" to inspire them.\nHopkins was barely a kindergartener when he realized he wanted to study medicine.  At 4, he was badly scalded by a solution of lye and hot water his brother was using to take paint off his bike. That first encounter with a doctor ignited his desire to be one.\nHe was a good student but knew college would be a financial burden for his parents. Then, in the 10th grade, Hopkins won a full scholarship to attend Morehouse College. He quit high school and his job as a paper boy and landed in Atlanta in 1957. \nHe was 15 and weighed a mere 87\u00bd pounds.\nHe sat through four years of tough classes with talented classmates like Julian Bond, the late civil rights activist, and inspiring professors who every day reminded him: Black people before you have beaten the odds and done well. So can you.\nIt was in his sophomore year at Morehouse that Hopkins first learned about the fiery serpent. A biology textbook contained a picture of a woman with a long worm erupting from her body. \n\"I never forgot it,\" Hopkins says, not with disgust but with the kind of awe a warrior might have for the most menacing enemy on the battlefield. \nHe carried that image with him as he equipped himself to become the greatest slayer of the worm.\nEpiphany\nIf Hopkins ever came close to having an epiphany, it would have been on a trip to Egypt in February 1961. \nAfter his junior year, Morehouse gave him the chance to study at the Institute of European Studies at the University of Vienna. During that stay, Hopkins and three friends traveled by train to Istanbul and Greece and then hopped a boat across the Mediterranean. \nOn the banks of the Nile, Hopkins saw swarms of flies surrounding children and adults, feasting on the mucus and discharge from their eyes. \nHe did not know then that those people were suffering from trachoma, an infectious eye disease that can cause blindness. But he knew at that moment that he wanted to study tropical diseases. Surely something could be done to prevent such suffering.\nThe next year, Hopkins graduated from Morehouse at the top of his class and entered medical school at the University of Chicago with the energy of a radioactive particle. \nHe was the only African-American in his class and intent on making his professors proud.  He graduated four years later, in 1966, and reported for his first job at the CDC. It was the same year the World Health Organization launched its global campaign to wipe out smallpox. \nWilliam Foege, the esteemed epidemiologist who steered the campaign, remembers walking in early into a room at the CDC for an informational session. Hopkins was already there, engrossed in that day's New York Times.  \nFoege dispatched Hopkins to Sierra Leone, which then had the highest rate of smallpox in the world. He led a team that implemented a new strategy devised by Foege of surveillance and containment, which focused on stopping transmission by finding and treating people who had been in close contact with infected people, instead of the previous, less-effective program of mass vaccinations.\nSierra Leone reported its last case of smallpox in April 1969. Foege credits Hopkins' work for how quickly that country became free of the deadly virus. Several years later, the CDC sent Hopkins, who by then had earned a master's degree in public health from Harvard, to India to lead the effort there.\nIn 1974, India reported a peak 188,000 cases; when Hopkins arrived, he was taken aback by the population density. He was also met with a great deal of skepticism. A man from Delhi told him that he knew his country better than Hopkins did and that smallpox would never be stamped out there. By May 1975, India was free of the killer disease.\nThe World Health Organization certified the end of smallpox in 1980. Foege's surveillance and containment strategy had worked at a record pace, and Hopkins intended to use it on his next target: Guinea worm.\nTwo years later, he found himself back in India. That's when he first came face to face with the serpent.\nCrusade against the worm\nThe man in the Indian city of Aurangabad had skin as dark as tar. The worms were milky white. From a distance, it looked to Hopkins like someone had thrown a bowl of noodles at the ailing man. Hopkins had never seen anything quite like it before. He found Guinea worm \"fascinating.\"\nHopkins was just beginning his crusade against the worm. Yet the creature was as ancient as the Bible. Many scholars believe the fiery serpents that attacked the children of Israel were Guinea worms, and a calcified worm was unearthed in a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy.\nOver the centuries, depictions of horrific Guinea worm infection have been documented in texts and pictures from Egypt to India. \nHuman beings contract the disease when they consume water from stagnant sources contaminated with the worm's larvae. Inside the body, the larvae mate and female worms grow for a year. After the incubation period, the female worm creates a painful lesion in the skin and pushes out from the body in search of a water source to deposit her millions of larvae.\nIt can take weeks, even months, for the worm to fully emerge. There is no treatment except to wrap the worm around a stick to facilitate its removal. Hopkins says it's plausible the symbol for medicine -- two serpents wrapped around a stick -- are not snakes, as is commonly believed, but Guinea worms.\nPeople have no option but to suffer through the process. If the worm is broken, its larvae goes into skin tissue. \nThe temptation is to seek relief from the terrible burning sensation caused by the emerging worm by immersing in water. But that just makes everything worse. Contact with the water triggers the Guinea worm to release her larvae and begin the cycle of infection all over again.\nThat first case Hopkins saw in India was tame compared to the suffering he would see later. It was especially difficult for him to hear the screams of children, some with multiple worms exiting their frail bodies.\nFor former President Carter, the indelible image is from Ghana, where he saw a worm piercing through a woman's nipple. She also had 11 other worms exit her body.\nThere is no cure for Guinea worm, no vaccine to guard against it. \nHopkins' challenge was how to prevent it and get rid of it altogether.\nIt would be a very different fight than smallpox, but again Hopkins set about his daunting task with aggressive surveillance programs that exposed the scope of the disease. Nigeria, for instance, reported a couple thousand cases a year. Hopkins discovered the shocking reality that the country really had 700,000 cases. Very few nations were cataloging the disease accurately.\n\"What he did was use good science,\" says Foege. \"In a public health program, there's no substitute for truth. You have to know what's going on. You have to have a surveillance program that actually lets you know how bad the disease is.\"\nHopkins' big boost came when Carter joined the fight. \nHopkins knew the power of support from big names and thought about courting someone like singer and activist Harry Belafonte to front the effort. But Hopkins had never imagined a former president would put his heart and soul into Guinea worm. Carter did so because he was so shocked that millions of people were suffering from something that was totally preventable.\nCarter's name brought immediate publicity and, more important, money and resources to fight what had been an obscure disease.\nGuinea worm once existed in many parts of the world but gradually disappeared with improved water sanitation. The key was to provide clean water to people in endemic countries. \nPrevailing thought was to dig wells or treat the remaining contaminated water sources with chemicals. But the answer, Hopkins realized, was far simpler. It did not involve sophisticated science or expensive drugs. All he had to do was to stop infected people from re-contaminating water sources and get them to strain their drinking water.\nIt wasn't about sticking a needle into someone's arm. It was about convincing people to make lifestyle changes and then motivating them to stick with their new routines. It was a simple solution that turned out to be far more complicated to implement.\n\"The big issue is with the life cycle of the worm,\" says Craig Withers, a senior Carter Center health official who has worked with Hopkins for many years. \"You don't know for a whole year if you are infected and we don't know the impact of our work until 12 months later. Whatever the results are for 2016 have already been determined in 2015.\"\nWith smallpox, people could see the results of refusing vaccinations. With Guinea worm there were no immediate signs that could convince villagers to strain their water. \nHopkins and his teams were persistent. They went to work convincing people to use filters with a fine mesh developed and donated by the DuPont chemical company. They empowered villagers to take control of their destinies by educating them and assigning monitors to keep watch over water sources.\nIn the last four countries still reporting cases of Guinea worm, the people affected are among the most marginalized, Withers says. They are often distrusting of outsiders. And outsiders have not always been kind to them.\nIn his smallpox days, Hopkins saw foreign health workers descend on villages and towns in Asia and Africa with a sense of superiority.\n\"They'd come with this attitude: 'I have degrees. I am from America. And I am here to tell you what to do, you ignorant people,'\" Hopkins recalls.\n\"People, no matter how materially poor they are, no matter their circumstances, pick up on that and they resent it.\"\nIt was something Hopkins was keenly aware of from his childhood in segregated Miami. \n\"It just gave me an instinctive sensitivity to condescension. It made me aware of how hurtful that was.\"\nAnd so the American disease doctor listened. He asked questions. No matter his inner frustrations, he kept a steady tone of voice. \nMakoy Samuel Yibi, the national coordinator for Guinea worm eradication in South Sudan, says Hopkins never lost faith, even when there were outbreaks of the disease and no meaningful reduction in cases was in sight.\n\"You have to focus,\" Hopkins told Makoy. \"You can do it. Surveillance. Say it three times. Understand the importance of building a structure (for surveillance).\" \nIn South Sudan, that meant having a presence in every community, with monitors in every village. \n\"We only have five villages left with reported cases,\" Makoy says. \nThis in a country where almost every deformity was once blamed on either gunshots or Guinea worm. \nLong and weary battle\nThe latest target date is 2020. That means next year, the Carter Center must report zero cases and it must stay that way for three years for the World Health Organization to certify eradication.\nThe biggest obstacle lies in Chad, a nation that was on the cusp of extinction a few years ago but is now reporting a spike in infections among dogs -- 459 cases in 2015. Hopkins says the dogs get infected by eating discarded guts of fish with water fleas carrying the Guinea worm larvae. \n\"We don't know yet how serious it is,\" he says. \nThe Carter Center has been educating people to cook their fish well and not discard the fish entrails but to bury them. It's also critical to keep infected dogs tied up when the worm starts coming out of their skin so they don't contaminate the water.\nThe only two cases the Carter Center has reported so far in 2016 are in Chad. Both were in children and both were contained. \n\"We've got a real chance of eradication as far as human cases go,\" Hopkins says.\nThe other disease on the brink of extinction is polio, which has also been inflicting pain on people for millennia. But polio is like smallpox in that it can be defeated with a vaccine. \nSome scientists think of smallpox and polio as hares in the eradication race and Guinea worm as the tortoise. In that context, there could not have been a man more suited for the slow journey than Hopkins. That he has persevered in cool and steady fashion is evidence of his tenacity, his colleagues say. \n\"It's just the way God made me,\" Hopkins says. \nHis connection with nature has helped him cope with work that can be grim and draining. \nWhen he first started working in Sierra Leone in 1968, Hopkins came across a field that had been cleared and burned after harvest. When the rains came, thousands and thousands of ground orchids sprung up from the embers. \nIt was the first time he'd ever seen them in the wild, so much beauty in the midst of something hideous like smallpox.\nMany years later, he saw the orchids again while driving through Ghana. \"Stop!\" he yelled to the driver, so he could take a long look.\nThey were signs of hope amid the suffering he sought to end.\nHopkins is fairly certain that one day people will look back at cancer and say: What a pity that it took so long to extinguish. And they will say it, too, about Guinea worm.\n\"People will find it hard to believe this disease existed; that there was such a disease so terrible. They will be flabbergasted it lasted so long after we figured out how to stop it.\"\nThat is, perhaps, Hopkins' biggest disappointment: It has taken too long to defeat the serpent. Everything in his office reminds him of the years that have gone by. \nBut he's not quitting. \nBesides, he's 17 years younger than former President Carter who, even after cancer, seems far from retirement.\n\"What on earth would I say to him? I'm packing it in when he's still going strong?\"\nHopkins places Henrietta back on his bookshelf. One day soon, he hopes, she will face him no longer as his nemesis but as the greatest testament to his life.", "Why you should drink coffee before a workout": "But First, Coffee ...\n\"Caffeine is a stimulant that acts on the central nervous system, the heart, and possibly the 'center' that controls blood pressure,\" all of which play a vital role in helping your mind and body push harder in a workout, says \nHeidi Skolnik\n, M.S., a sports nutritionist and owner of Nutrition Conditioning, Inc. \"It can also increase the release of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine, which effects pain receptors and mood\" while you're working out.\nDaily Burn: 19 Ways to Trick Yourself Into Becoming a Morning Person\nIn other words, you'll actually \nenjoy getting sweaty\n and it will feel easier when you're powering through those last few reps. Plus, \nresearchers found\n that when people caffeinated before a workout, they ate 72 fewer calories later in the day and had an easier time keeping cravings in check. Not a bad deal. Here's how you, too, can make the most of your next brew.\nIf You're a Morning Exerciser ...\nEnjoy an a.m. cappuccino before the gym? Skolnik says timing can play an important role in your overall performance. \"Caffeine is \nquickly absorbed\n from the stomach within 15 to 45 minutes of consumption, but it hits its peak stimulatory effects between 30 and 75 minutes,\" she says. Drinking a cup about one hour before you work out is optimal, Skolnik says.\nYou'll want more fluids than just an eight-ounce mug of joe to get adequately prepped, though. Chasing your brew with some water is key if you're not getting to your workout right away. \"Coffee counts as a fluid,\" says Skolnik, but you'll still want some additional liquid in your tank. If you have an hour or two before your workout, pair your java with seven to 12 ounces of water.\nDaily Burn: How Much Coffee Is Too Much?\nJust remember: Too much caffeine can have a laxative effect, Skolnik says. (Obviously, not an ideal situation to find yourself in.) OD'ing on coffee can also lead to dehydration, so keep an eye on how many cups you're downing. (To check your hydration status, look at the \ncolor of your urine\n \u2014 the deeper the color, the more dehydrated you are.)\nAnd if you usually take your coffee black, you might want to consider adding milk to your mug. Whether you choose real dairy or soy, you'll get an extra hit of protein and carbs. Those nutrients can help boost blood sugar after a night of sleep, and can also rev your mental engine to help get your head around tough tasks (think: box jumps), Skolnik adds.\nIf You Work Out at Night ...\nBad news for night owls: If you lace up more often in the afternoon or evening, you might have to miss out on the workout-boosting benefits of coffee. Caffeine stays in your system for four to six hours after drinking, says Skolnik. But it affects everyone differently. Having some before your 7 p.m. workout may be just fine, whereas your \nrunning BFF\n could do the exact same thing and find herself unable to sleep at 1a.m. \nResearchers think\n that's because a person's genetic makeup, body weight and age all play a role in how our enzymes break down caffeine.\nDaily Burn: Can't Sleep? Your Guide to a Better Rest\nWhatever you do, don't sacrifice sleep for a caffeine fix. Shut-eye is \"imperative for recovery, appetite regulation and more,\" says Skolnik. If you're unable to fall asleep at your desired bedtime, then she suggests skipping the stimulant or switching to a.m. workouts.\nThat said, you can also try changing your roast for a shorter-lasting buzz. Dark roast coffee can \nhave less caffeine\n than a light one. (Smaller light roasted beans mean you get more beans, i.e. more caffeine, per scoop.) Cold brew coffee tends to \nhave less caffeine\n, too. Tea is another option that can provide less of a jolt \u2014 black tea has \n14 to 70 mg of caffeine\n in an eight-ounce cup compared to 95 to 200 mg in the same size cup of coffee.\nSkolnik says most people only need 250 to 300 mg of caffeine per day to feel its performance-enhancing effect (though it varies based on your body weight and your fitness goals). So opting for a smaller dose could be the best way to get the biggest bang for your, er, mug without foregoing coffee completely.\nThis story originally appeared on\n Daily Burn\n.", "Bullying is a 'serious public health problem,' report says": "\"We need to understand that this is a public health problem faced by a third of our children,\" said Dr. Frederick Rivara, chairman of the committee compiling the report. \"It has a major effect on their academic performance as well as their mental and physical health.\"\nThe effects of bullying\nIn addition to causing depression and anxiety and leading to alcohol and drug abuse into adulthood, the harmful effects of bullying manifest themselves physically in kids and teens by disrupting their sleep, causing gastrointestinal issues and headaches. \nResearchers also noticed that bullying causes changes in the stress response system of the brain, affecting cognitive function and self-regulating emotions. Children who are bullied as well as those who bully others are more likely to contemplate or attempt suicide. \nBullies themselves are negatively impacted by their own behavior. They are more likely to be depressed, are at great risk for poor psychological and social outcomes and are more likely to engage in high-risk activities such as vandalism and theft. \nDetermining the scope of bullying hasn't always been easy due to \ndifferences in how it's defined or measured\n, but the committee looked at research suggesting that anywhere between 18% and 31% of kids are affected by bullying. Cyberbullying affected between 7% and 15% of kids, and it's on the rise. \nThere are also vulnerable subgroups at a higher risk for bullying, including kids who are obese or disabled, who identify as LGBT or who have fewer peers of the same ethnicity within their school.\nWhat is bullying?\nFor the sake of having a consistent definition of what bullying means, the committee referred to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's current definition: Bullying is any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated, and bullying may inflict harm or distress on the targeted youth including physical, psychological, social or educational harm. \nThe report also focused on ages 5 to 18 years, in line with the CDC, because it's just as important to \naddress bullying in early childhood as well as emerging adulthood\n. \nBecause cyberbullying is carried about by some of the same individuals and directed at the same targets, it is included within the broader definition rather than standing on its own. But Rivara acknowledged that more research needs to be done in order to understand cyberbullying and the most effective ways to combat it. \nEven if cyberbullying isn't repetetive, which bullying often is by definition, it is still harmful because \"a single perpetrating act on the Internet can be shared or viewed multiple times,\" according to the report. \nHow to prevent it\nGiven the proven \nshort- and long-term \"psychological consequences\"\n for both the bullied and bullies themselves, the report committee determined which type of evidence-based programs can help to prevent it in the future. The report also includes suggested guidelines and policies for the future.\nThe recommendations include arriving at a consistent and comprehensive definition for bullying, more longitudinal studies about its prevalence, evaluating antibullying policies, developing and implementing evidence-based programs, and training and partnering with social media companies on policies to identify and respond to cyberbullying. \nAnd it's time to shift away from zero-tolerance policies in schools and switch to \nPositive Behavioral Interventions & Supports\n or PBIS, which have a proven track record in more than 20,000 schools, according to committee member Catherine Bradshaw, a developmental psychologist and youth violence prevention researcher.\n\"Zero-tolerance policies were developed to address a variety of behaviors around bullying, but they don't work and may actually be harmful,\" Rivara said. \"Under zero tolerance, bullies would be expelled or suspended. This decreases their chances of getting better or completing school and ultimately getting a job. They need help. With different programs, we can end the behavior but help them at the same time.\" \nThe PBIS programs have reduced rates of bullying, improved discipline and academic performance and created a better and healthier climate in the schools utilizing them, Bradshaw said. The programs focus on social emotional learning, which helps kids and teens to learn how to regulate their emotions, build empathy and identify the difference between teasing and bullying. \nThis can be used in conjunction with more intensive programs that are aimed at kids who are already involved in bullying, as a target or a perpetrator.\n\"Children need to be taught these skills like they would math and science,\" Bradshaw said. \nBut Bradshaw also said there is more room for utilizing innovation and technology to better identify and prevent bullying. \n\"We see a disconnect between the rates of bullying mentioned by kids and what adults are seeing and hearing,\" she said. \nFor that reason, the committee is calling for more data collection on bullying, like increased surveys among students, even if they are anonymous. Then, teachers can have a better idea of where the bullying is occurring and what type of bullying it is, and they can increase supervision. More research also needs to be done around bullies themselves, as well as bystanders.\nAs part of the training recommended by the committee, Bradshaw believes that more professional development models on bullying intervention could benefit from emerging technology. Role play through video games could seem more real and convincing to kids and adults working through scenarios as the bully, target or bystander, for example.\nPreventing bullying outside school\nPolicies and programs need to transcend schools and reach the state level and federal agencies, the committee advised. All 50 states have adopted or revised laws to address bullying over the past 15 years, and almost all include cyberbullying. But the report encouraged state attorneys general to continually work with researchers on the best and most updated guidance for amending laws or creating new ones in anti-bullying campaigns. \nFamilies were also a focus of the report.\nStart the conversation at home before bullying occurs, Bradshaw said. Parents and families can provide critical emotional support, which helps kids open up about bullying that they are experiencing or witnessing. Family members can also help them cope and figure out how to handle and diffuse any situation that might arise, according to the report. \nStopBullying.gov\n is a one-stop shop for kids, parents and teachers to learn the signs and symptoms of bullying, as well as strategies for stopping it, Bradshaw said.\nWhat people learn about bullying early on can make a difference later.\n\"The important skills we're teaching kids now, when they're in school, are the same skills they need for life,\" Rivara said. ", "Get on board: The new four-wheeled sport for everyone": "At its most elemental, it's about who gets from point A to point B the fastest. Humans can run, climb or swim to do it, and we've invented and repurposed ways to add speed using horses, cars, boats, bikes and skis. \nOnce you have a mode of transportation enjoyed by at least two people, you technically have all the ingredients for a race. Add more people and some organization, rules and competitive events, and you have a sport. \nThat's the evolutionary story of everything from the Indianapolis 500 and the America's Cup to the Triple Crown and the Tour de France. \nYou can now add skateboarding to the list: not the little trick boards built for flips, grabs and grinds but longer boards originally built for commuting and now modified for speed.  \nFrom college commutes to big-city outlaws\n\"It started becoming popular for surfers riding them when the waves weren't good,\" said nationally ranked longboard racer Conan Gay. \"Sidewalk surfing\" on homemade longboards was obscure for decades, before manufactured versions began showing up on college campuses in the late 1990s. For the cooler undergrads, the option was more stable and faster than traditional skateboards and much cheaper than cars. \nIn cities, longboarding became what the Segway never did: an alternative way to commute to work. \nLongboards are smaller than bikes, less crowded and unfettered by delays, compared with the subway. And they're cheaper than both. \nBut there is a moment in the evolution of every sport when transportation turns into race. For longboarding, this was in 2002, when 16 skaters in New York raced more than 7 miles from 116th Street to Wall Street, mainly along Broadway. Among those in the nascent longboarding community, word of the \"\nBroadway Bomb\n\" spread quickly.\nNow, every third Saturday in October, this \"outlaw\" (meaning no police barriers from vehicular traffic nor official times recorded) takes place. Numbers are difficult to ascertain but have reached as many as 2,000 skaters in recent years, even as police actively try to stop some of them with nets. The motto of the unsanctioned competition is \"You May Die\" -- though no one has in its 13-year history. Helmets are a must when racing.\nThe sport is more accurately described as \"long-distance pushing\" or LDP -- as opposed to downhill or slalom longboard racing -- and since the Broadway Bomb started, the competition has gone legit. It has an organizing body, the \nSkate International Distance and Supercross Association\n, that establishes the rules, coordinates with local officials and insures the racers against injuries. The association also tracks official times for prizes and ranks the best racers, who can reach speeds up to 20 miles per hour.\nCompetitions are added every year, growing from five sanctioned races in 2011 to 15 this year, with 50 to 150 racers in each. It's even growing internationally, with races in France, Brazil and the Netherlands, where bike-friendly routes have produced some of the best push-skaters in the world.\nAccording to Gay, the race that brought everyone together was the 2010 Hallandale Adrenalina Skateboard Marathon in Florida. It had a $15,000 purse for first place and is where the Skate International Distance and Supercross Association formed.\nLong-distance pushing is also making strides, so to speak, in changing the definition of a skateboarder. The athletes who compete in these races are a much more diverse, inclusive, physically fit and supportive \"tribe\" or \"family\" (their words) than the stereotype of young punks showing off for bragging rights around a skatepark. \n\"I live in Massachusetts and skate by myself,\" said Calleigh Little, 24, who looks forward to competitions to see friends who share her love of the sport. She is a transgender woman who took up distance longboarding after losing her driver's license and needing a way to get to work. Riding long distances helped clear her mind, and the farther she got, the more she considered competing in the sport. She's now  planning a \nskating trip across America\n this fall.\nLongboarders now come from all parts of the country, young and old and of all ethnicities, with the sport as the commonality that bonds them. \nThis year, it brought more than 60 athletes, including the best in the country, to a new a city on the circuit: Bend, Oregon. \nA bend of brothers\nDeep in the National Forest country of central Oregon, below the skiable Cascade Mountains and a river running through, lies the picturesque town of Bend. \nThe town has more than its share of great coffee shops, local brewpubs and outdoor recreation outfitters, including \n Aspect Board & Brews\n, where the athletes reunited over beers ahead of racing. Here, Jonathan \"Joner\" Strauss, one of the founders of the skate association, explained the origin of the next day's race: the \nBend Beatdown\n. \nHe explained how the race was initially his idea, but it was Gay -- a Bend resident ranked fourth in the world for the most miles skateboarded in 24 hours -- who had to \"sell the whole idea to the city\" while seeking permission to host the race. \n\"They had never heard of it [or knew] it's an actual sport,\" Gay said. \"I showed them my board and showed them video clips. They were kind of iffy about it, but they gave me a shot.\" \nGay found a sponsor that offered $2,000 in prize money.\nThe Bend Beatdown consisted of two races, a 5K and 10K. Most of the racers, ages 8 to 56, competed in both. \nThis year, it was a beautiful, sunny day with cool temperatures and a lot of bonhomie. The top-ranked racers were positioned in front, though each was individually timed. \nThe end of the 10K had a bit of last-minute drama as the front-runner, Colby Cummings, wobbled off the path and lost his pole position. \n\"There's no room for error,\" said Andrew Andres, an ultra-skater who won the overall men's final at the Bend Beatdown. \"A little pebble or pine cone in the road, and that's it.\"\nSome racers collapsed in exhaustion at the end. At nearly 4,000 feet above sea level, Bend's elevation took a toll on racers from sea level towns, and a few threw up, but overall the result was positive. \n\"I'm completely stoked. We had a really great weekend. Everyone is already talking about next year,\" Gay said. \"I didn't want the weekend to end.\" \nCity officials were pleased too and have approved a second Beatdown for next summer. To alleviate any more throwing up, Gay said, next year he will probably schedule the group drinks the night of the race instead of the night before.\nNever be board again\nDon't underestimate the power of fun in getting fit. Longboarders love riding, and that doesn't seem to fade even when they do it for 24 hours straight. \n\"My Zen spot is when my feet hit the board,\" Andres said.\nIf you take up this sport, not only is the learning curve relatively short, you won't find your workout routine getting, well, routine. It can become your school or work commute.\nThe physical benefits of longboarding are mainly cardio and strength training, especially with longer races. Unlike traditional skateboarders, longboarders alternate their kicking legs, building strong calves and glutes with every power push. \nAdd balancing, switching sides on the board, swinging arms for momentum and squatting, and you can see how longboarding works your upper body and abdominals as well, with the added benefit of improved coordination. \n\"You hear a lot about core strengthening, and longboarding forces the core every step of the way,\" explained CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"Having tried it recently, I found myself flexing and contracting muscle groups that hardly ever get a workout.\"\nSo if you're looking for a friendly, fun, safe (with helmets!) and legitimately cool new sport, consider longboard push racing, the most accessible and trending of the board sports.", "'Miracle' cells could cure blindness": "At least not yet.\nAge-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) affects around 15 million people in the \nU.S. alone\n, and globally up to 30 million. For most victims, vitamins and pain relief are the best treatment available.\nBut Professor Pete Coffey of \nUniversity College London\n is pioneering a new therapy that could stop the disease in its tracks, and restore vision to the blind, through the \nLondon Project to Cure Blindness\n.\nAMD kills the eye's Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE), a layer of cells that support and nourish the eye's vision center, the macula, which then also gradually dies. Victims experience a black spot in their vision that grows outward, while they lose the ability to read and recognize familiar faces.\nCoffey has spent the past eight years creating and refining his treatment to restore vision and on August 11, 2015, the first patient received it.\nThe landmark operation\nThe patient was a 60-year-old woman suffering with a severe form of AMD. Blood vessels at the back of her eyes had burst, flooding the retina and rapidly destroying her vision.   \nSurgeons at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London implanted a thin layer of cells behind the retina of each eye on a polyester patch just three millimeters wide. They used stem cells due to their ability to become many other cell types in the body. In this case, they had been cultivated as RPE cells to replace the patient's diminished stock.\n\"Recovery is possible ... there is a window when you can put the cells in and recover the patient's vision,\" says Coffey. He hopes for patients to get their lives back. \"I would hope they can recognize their families again,\" he says. \nBut six months on from the landmark operation, the award-winning ophthalmologist is hesitant to declare victory.\n\"We are assessing her vision -- we need more information to make conclusions,\" says Coffey. \"I'm pleasantly surprised the cells are surviving to this stage given how nasty (bloody) the environment was.\" \nNine more patients will go under the knife during this trial. If it proves successful, Coffey hopes the procedure can become as routine as cataract surgery -- ending the suffering of millions.\n\"My deeply cherished ambition is to make this therapy readily available for anyone suffering with AMD,\" he says.\nFirst steps as a student\nAs a psychology undergraduate in the early 1980s, Coffey was inspired by the work of a research group in Sweden led by Professor \nAnders Bjorklund\n, which was exploring cell transplant therapies in the brain to treat Parkinson's disease.\nCoffey followed the group's work avidly, but wondered why these radical new therapies were being applied to an organ as complex as the brain.\n\"Why not look at system we know a lot about, and can test easily?\" he thought.\nThe eye was the obvious choice for Coffey, for its accessibility, relative ease of monitoring, and the \"immune privilege\" that makes it less likely to reject transplant material than other parts of the body.\nWithin the eye, he targeted RPE cells, as their function appeared less complex than that of other cells involved in the progression of the disease.\nFrom 1998, Coffey began to develop his therapies for the RPE, drawing on a recent advance that was then spreading excitement throughout the field of regenerative medicine: stem cells.\nRollercoaster journey\nCoffey enjoyed early success. He was initially able to repair the vision of several patients by transplanting healthy cells from other parts of their eye into diseased areas and his work was praised by peers in the field.\nHowever, a lack of funding threatened to curtail his progress, and by 2006 it had become almost impossible to continue. \"That was the most difficult period,\" Coffey reflects. \"The project could have finished there.\"\nBut it didn't.\nCoffey received a surprise call from an anonymous U.S. philanthropist offering a no-strings donation of $5.6 million.\nCoffey seized the opportunity, and made an ambitious commitment -- to fast-track a stem cell therapy for AMD in human trials within five years, a process that might otherwise have taken 20.  \nThe \nLondon Project to Cure Blindness\n was born.\nThe first step was to assemble an inter-disciplinary A-team of scientists, engineers and clinicians, including vitreoretinal surgeon \nLyndon De Cruz\n, who would eventually conduct the landmark procedure.\nThe team moved swiftly through the phases: They selected human embryo cells as their source, after rejecting those of cadavers', demonstrated the procedure using animals and manufactured the cells to clinical standards for use in humans.\n\"That was the most confidence-boosting part of the project,\" recalls Coffey. \"We had the cells in the dish and they would do whatever we wanted -- eat rubbish, produce chemicals, handle stress -- whatever we threw at the cells, they passed.\"\nWearing many hats\nAs the Project entered unchartered territory, innovation was a constant requirement. New surgical tools were invented, technology from the Hubble telescope was adapted as an imaging tool, and multiple designs were explored and rejected for the membrane that would carry the stem cells into the eye.\n\"The membrane was the scariest bit -- I'm not a bioengineer,\" says Coffey. \"I had to get off my specialist area.\"\nBut Coffey had to wear many hats -- none more alien than that of political lobbyist. After the 2010 general election it was feared that research funding could be cut, so Coffey invited government officials on a tour of his lab. He was relieved to be spared in their spending review.\nProgress continued and Coffey's therapy finally reached trial in 2015 -- three years later than planned.\nA thriving landscape\nThe landscape today for eye-related stem cell therapy is teeming with innovation -- and competition. Groups in the United States, Japan, and Israel are testing RPE replacement treatments with a range of cell sources and delivery methods, including a new type of stem cell that had arrived on the scene, known as Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells.\nIn 2012, John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their discovery and development of iPS cells, which allow almost any cell in the body to be reprogrammed into a stem cell. Using these as a source would lower the risk of immune-system rejection as the patient's own cells can be used, and this also sidesteps ethical objections to the use of embryos.\nThe first iPS cell trials with humans were on RPE cells, at the Riken Center in Japan. However, this highlighted a key risk of the practice, as the trial was discontinued after causing abnormal growth in one subject.\nLooking out for hurdles\nCoffey believes there are two major health concerns with this form of cell therapy. \"You don't want cells to proliferate -- this is often defined as a tumor,\" he says. \"You also don't want cells wandering off elsewhere in the body (such as) your heart or lungs.\"\nBut he is convinced that the eye should remain the vanguard of stem research, and Deborah Sweet, editor of Cell journal, agrees.\n\"The eye has advanced more than most areas,\" she says, adding that Coffey's work is \"one of the first examples of stem application and I'm excited to see it.\"\nDr. Sally Temple, president of the \nInternational Society for Stem Cell Research\n, believes Coffey's therapy can enable further breakthroughs. \"If RPE replacement works, this will help pave the way for replacement of other retinal cells, and other central nervous system cells.\"\nHowever, Temple adds a note of caution over the current trial. \"A permanent patch such as polyester forms a barrier. If the RPE cells die (this) could cause the overlying retina to die.\"\nThe future will have a cure ... and more\nFollowing his recent successes, Coffey is already pursuing new horizons. He is globalizing his AMD therapy through an affiliate in California, and running offshoot project the \"Bank of Disease,\" targeting new treatments for a range of blindness-causing conditions, such as the inherited conditions Retinitis Pigmentosa and Stargardt's Disease that also result from damage within the retina.\nThe scientist is also looking even further ahead, predicting that it will become possible to regenerate cells in the body itself -- without need of transplants.\n \"I always keep sight of the future,\" says Coffey. \nThanks to his work, millions of people could keep theirs.", "A dreaded superbug found for the first time in a U.S. woman": "The case was detailed in a report by the U.S. Department of Defense on Thursday. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden talked about the case at the National Press Club in Washington. \nThe woman went to a clinic in Pennsylvania, and a sample was forwarded to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Walter Reed found the bacteria in her urine. There is no indication of how the bacteria got into the woman's system. She had not traveled outside the United States within the past five months. \nThe CDC and the Pennsylvania Department of Health \nmobilized immediately\n to investigate the case and to trace contacts the patient may have had to see whether the bacteria had spread. \nThe woman was treated and released and has no  other medical problems related to the bacteria that we know of, according to Dr. Alex Kallen, a medical officer with the CDC.\nThe CDC said it is looking for other potential cases in the health care facility the patient visited. \nThe bacteria have been identified in other infections outside the United States. Doctors saw cases in\n Europe, Canada and China. \nThe \nU.S. Department of Agriculture\n also found one strain of Colistin-resistant E. coli in a single sample of a pig intestine, according to a statement from the Department of Health and Human Services. The USDA is trying to determine what farm the pig came from to see whether any other animals were impacted. \nThese two cases are what the CDC characterized as a \"warning sign, more than a catastrophe,\" according to Kallen.\nThe concern is that traits of this rare mutant Colistin-resistent E. coli could jump to other bacteria that respond only to Colistin, creating a potentially unstoppable superbug. \nOne report suggests that antibiotic-resistant infections can result in the deaths of half the patients who become infected.\nAntibiotic resistance has become a growing problem in this country. \nThe World Health Organization \nhas warned that it is one of the biggest threats to global health today.\nFrieden warned that although this is the first case in the United States, we should expect to see more such superbugs in the near future. Frieden, who often warns doctors against overuse of antibiotics, urged scientists to develop new drugs quickly.\nEach year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with other kinds of bacteria that can't be beaten with most antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die each year as a result of those infections, \naccording to the CDC.\n\"The medicine cabinet is empty for some patients,\" Frieden said. \"It is the end of the road unless we act urgently.\" ", "Blind climber scaled the seven summits": "But his greatest challenge started at 4 years old when he was diagnosed with a rare eye disease called\n juvenile retinoschisis\n. For almost 10 years, Weihenmayer was faced with an inevitable truth:  One day he wouldn't be able to see the world around him. \nBy his freshman year in high school, Weihenmayer was blind. \n\"I wanted to be with my friends and going on dates,\" he says. \"I was afraid that I wasn't going to be able to participate in life.\"\nBut his parents refused to let him sit on the sidelines. \n\"My dad would sweep me out into the world and I'd get beat up a little bit and shattered,\" he recalls.  \"And my mom would build me up and my dad would sweep me out again. And that's a hard thing to do as a parent.\" \nBefore losing his sight, Weihenmayer couldn't participate in physical sports because it would damage his retinas, making his sight get worse at a faster pace. In a way, going blind allowed him to start his life.\nHe joined the wrestling team and went all the way to the National Junior Freestyle Wrestling Championship in Iowa.\n\"Wrestling really changed my life because it was the first time as a blind person that I was a part of something bigger than me,\" Weihenmayer says. \nHe also learned how to rock climb. \n\"I remember loving rock climbing because it's a stable rock face. It's not moving, hopefully, and you're just feeling your way up the rock face,\" he says. \nAfter graduating from Boston College, Weihenmayer moved to Phoenix to be a teacher. He spent every weekend rock climbing with the Arizona Mountaineering Club.\nHis quest for adventure began to take shape after he and a team of friends climbed Denali, the tallest peak in North America. \n\"I thought how amazing to make your life like this great adventure and just go around and be on every continent climbing the tallest peak,\" he remembers. \nAfter scaling four of the seven summits, he set his sights on Everest.\n\"A lot of the Himalayan experts said the ice is so hard up high, you can't throw your ice ax down into the snow so you cannot stop if you fall,\" Weihenmayer says. \"You can't think at high altitude. Above 26,000 feet, you're in the 'death zone' so your brain doesn't work very well. So it wouldn't be a good place for a blind person.\"\nBut he never lost hope. \n\"They were judging me on the basis of one thing that they knew about me and that was being blind. But they didn't realize that there are a dozen other attributes that contribute to whether you're a good mountaineer or not,\" he says. \nWeihenmayer put together a strong team, received funding from the National Federation of the Blind and set out on his most dangerous and deadly expedition.\n\"You gotta keep an open, clear mind throughout the whole experience. You get beat down one day, just completely crushed, and you gotta wake up the next day and do it all over again,\" he says. \nDespite his critics, in 2001, Weihenmayer became the first blind person in history to reach the summit of Mount Everest. \n\"You can't even believe it in a way that you're standing up there. You're with your team, and yeah, there might be a few tears. You hold your flag and you get your photos but then you have to turn around and get down,\" he recalls. \"You gotta get down alive.\"\nWeihenmayer not only made it down the mountain, he went on to climb the remaining seven summits in 2008.\nAlways seeking new adventures, Weihenmayer spent the next six years training to kayak the 277 miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.  \n\"Sitting above a rapid knowing that in the next two minutes you're going through absolute insanity ... it was a very different experience from climbing,\" he says.\nWeihenmayer used waterproof Bluetooth radios to communicate with his guide. He and nine other paddlers made it through the Grand Canyon in 20 days. \n\"I'm not just doing these things so I can prove that blind people can do this or that. That's kind of shallow,\" he says. \"You do it because that's living fully.\"\nWeihenmayer is using that mantra to help others. He co-founded the nonprofit \nNo Barriers\n in 2005 to help people overcome obstacles through educational programs, adaptive activities and transformative experiences.\n\"No Barriers is about really figuring out how to tap into whatever we've got inside of us and then build the tools and the community around us to break through barriers, live with purpose and be the person you're meant to be,\" he says.\nThroughout his life, Weihenmayer has been featured in \nthree documentaries\n and written \nthree books\n: \"Touch the Top of the World,\" \"The Adversity Advantage\" and \"No Barriers,\" which will be available in February 2017.\nThe now 47-year-old, who lives in Colorado with his wife and two kids, also uses his story to inspire others through motivational speeches. \n\"It really takes this mindset of not being afraid to turn into the storm,\" he says. \"In our lives all of us in a way are climbing blind.\"", "Where do we stand now: E-cigarettes": "\"This action is a milestone in consumer protection -- going forward, the FDA will be able to review new tobacco products not yet on the market, help prevent misleading claims by tobacco product manufacturers, evaluate the ingredients of tobacco products and how they are made, and communicate the potential risks of tobacco products,\" the FDA said in announcing the extension of its authority. \nThe FDA said it will also control the \"parts\" and \"components\" of tobacco. For e-cigarettes, that would include e-liquids, atomizers, batteries, flavors, vials that contain e-liquids and programmable software.\nE-cigarettes work by heating a pure liquid called e-juice -- composed of flavorings, propylene glycol, glycerin and often nicotine -- until it vaporizes. The resulting vapor is much less offensive to many -- both smokers and non-smokers -- and some studies have shown that it helps smokers quit. In fact, many e-cigarette users don't call themselves smokers, preferring to use the term \"vapers\" instead.\nThis action by the FDA highlights the growing controversy over the potential danger of e-cigarettes. Are they really an effective way to quit smoking? Does \"vaping\" introduce health issues all its own, such as encouraging adolescents who would otherwise never smoke to take a puff off the real thing? Science and public policy have bounced back and forth for over a decade, as different studies produce different -- and sometimes contradictory -- results.  Let's take a look at the debate over the years:\n2003 headline: Invention of e-cigarettes \nThree pack-a-day smoker \nHon Lik, a 52-year-old Beijing pharmacist\n, creates the first successful electronic cigarette after his father, another heavy smoker, dies of lung cancer. By 2007, e-cigarettes are marketed in Europe and the United States by the manufacturer Ruyan as a way to safely stop smoking tobacco.\nHon is not the first person on record to have the idea for an electronic non-tobacco option. Herbert A. Gilbert \nfiled for a patent in 1963\n, in an era when tobacco smoking was widely accepted and the health risks were less apparent.\n2008 headline: WHO slams e-cigarette marketing\nIn September 2008, the \nWorld Health Organization\n announces that marketers should immediately remove any claims that e-cigs are a \"safe and effective smoking cessation aid\" because there is \"no scientific evidence to confirm the product's safety and efficacy.\"\nSoon after, \na study funded by e-cigarette manufacturer Ruyan\n declares the product to be 100 to 1,000 times less dangerous than smoking tobacco, adding that when using their device, nicotine is \"apparently not absorbed from the lung, but from the upper airways.\"\n2010 headline: The battle heats up\nIn May 2009, the \nFood and Drug Administration releases the results\n (PDF) of a test of two U.S. e-cig brands, NJOY and Smoking Everywhere, that finds \"very low\" amounts of nicotine in cartridges labeled as nicotine-free. Then in July, \nan FDA news release \ndiscourages the use of e-cigarettes, saying they contain carcinogens and an ingredient used in antifreeze, diethylene glycol. \nAnother concern of the FDA's: E-cigarettes are often marketed and sold to youngsters who, intrigued by the many flavors such as chocolate, bubble gum and mint, might easily adopt a smoking habit as a result of trying the devices. \nVape supporters counter that diethylene glycol was found at a very low, non-toxic level of 1%, and that the carcinogens are at the same levels as other FDA-approved nicotine cessation products, like patches and gum.\nBy the end of the year, Amazon and Paypal restrict the sale of e-cigs on their websites.  \n2011 headline: Interest in vaping for smoking cessation is high\nScience begins to ramp up studies on the topic. Several studies find \ninterest in e-cigarettes\n is high among the American public: \nGoogle searches\n for e-cigs are higher in the U.S. than any other nation. \nA \nquestionnaire\n of 3,500 e-cigarette users finds that most vape because they think it is less toxic and cheaper than tobacco, and will help them quit or cut down on tobacco smoking. Most ex-smokers (79%) in the study are afraid they will relapse if they stop using e-cigarettes.  The study doesn't examine the safety of the product.\nAnother, much smaller \nemail study\n of 216 e-cigarette users finds that 31% were tobacco free at six months, while 66% were able to cut back on the number of conventional cigarettes they smoked. A still \nsmaller study\n of 40 smokers also finds that adding e-cigarettes helped smokers reduce the number of traditional cigarettes they smoked each day. \n2012 headline: E-cigarette use doubles in adolescents \nThe Centers for Disease Control announces that e-cigarette use among \nU.S. middle and high school students\n doubles between 2011 and 2012, mirroring a similar increase in adult use. Most alarming for policy makers: CDC concerns that vaping among adolescents may serve as a gateway to tobacco use. \nTo measure nicotine delivery, \nUnited Kingdom researchers\n test 16 e-cigarettes with an automatic smoking machine and find wide variations in nicotine levels per puff, ranging from 0.5 to 15.4 mg. In contrast, the typical level from a\n tobacco puff\n ranges only from 1.54 to 2.60. The wide variation between e-cigarette brands leads researchers to question how well they can function as a nicotine replacement device.\n2013 headline: Do e-cigs really help smokers quit?\nSeveral 2013 publications show minimal evidence that e-cigarettes help smokers quit.  A \ncross-sectional study\n of 1,836 tobacco smokers finds a significant association with e-cig use and \"unsuccessful quitter\" status but none with 'quitter\" status.  \nAnother \nstudy of callers to state tobacco quitlines\n finds e-cigarette users significantly less likely to be tobacco-free seven months after they first try vaping compared with participants who never try e-cigarettes.  \nA \nNew Zealand Health Research Council study\n of 657 smokers finds e-cigarettes modestly effective in helping smokers quit. Interestingly enough, it didn't seem to matter whether they contained nicotine or not.  But the results were similar to already FDA approved nicotine patches.\nSome researchers worry that e-cigarette use might distract smokers from proven safe and effective methods for kicking their tobacco habit. \"It's filter tipped, low tar, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\" Dr. Frank Leone and Dr. Ivor Douglas say in their \nessay\n \"The Emergence of E-Cigarettes: A Triumph of Wishful Thinking over Science.\"\n2014 headline: Poison center calls skyrocket\nThe \nCenters for Disease Control releases data \nshowing that the number of calls about nicotine e-juice to poison centers rose from a scant one call per month in 2010 to 215 calls per month in 2014. More than half of the calls involved children under the age of 5 ingesting, inhaling or getting the substance in their eyes or on the skin.  \nA \nstudy of over 75,000 Korean adolescents\n finds e-cigarette use to be strongly associated with current and heavy traditional cigarette smoking.  Data from the CDC find that the use of e-cigarettes among \nU.S. high school students\n grew from 4.5% in 2013 to 13% in 2014. In that same time period, use grew among middle-schoolers from 1% to 4%.\nA study comparing the e-cigarette inhaler to the\n barely used FDA approved nicotine inhaler \nfor smoking cessation finds the e-cig version a clear winner with users, providing more satisfaction and a better image. \nIn regard to safety, a study finds that e-cigarettes do contain \ntobacco-specific nitrosamines and heavy metals\n like cadmium, nickel and lead, but the levels are 9 to 450 times lower than traditional cigarettes. The \neffect on lung function\n of glycol derivatives found in e-cigarettes was also much less than conventional cigarettes. \nStill, researchers aren't convinced. \"Although these data suggest that e-cigarettes may be a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes,\" say \nreviewers\n Bradley Drummond and Donna Upson, \"there are no data regarding the long-term cancer risk associated with low-level exposure to the detected carcinogens. Similar to cancer risk, there are no published data describing the long-term lung function or cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes.\"\n2015 headline: Vaping could be dangerous, but perhaps a quitting aid\nA \nNew England Journal of Medicine study\n sets off alarm bells by reporting that some e-cigarettes release formaldehyde, a probable carcinogen, when heated by high-voltage batteries. \nA \nCleveland Clinic clinical review\n restates ongoing concerns about propylene glycol, or PG, and the various food flavorings that are part of e-juice. While considered safe to eat in food in small quantities, researchers say PGs have not been studied when \"inhaled deeply and repeatedly.\"\nAnother study looks at 51 of the nearly 7,000 \ne-cigarette flavors \ncurrently marketed to check for a flavoring chemical called diacetyl that has been shown to be associated with a disease called \npopcorn lung\n. The study finds diacetyl at higher than laboratory normal levels in 39 of the tested flavors. Researchers call for \"urgent action\" to evaluate the \"potentially widespread exposure.\"\nIn September, new research from the \nprestigious medical journal BMJ\n finds that teens who use e-cigarettes are more than three times as likely to be smoking traditional cigarettes a year later. \nIn December, a \nSan Diego Veterans Affairs lab investigation\n found that two e-cigarette products damaged cells in ways that could lead to cancer, even when nicotine-free.  Creating an extract from e-cig vapor, the researchers exposed cells in Petri dishes. The exposed cells showed breaks in DNA strands, which can lead to cancer, and a greater tendency towards cell death.\nHowever, a \n2015 report by Public Health England\n (PDF) encourages the medical licensing of e-cigarettes in the UK as nicotine replacement therapy, stating that the use of vaping is \"95% safer than smoking\" and \"can help people to quit smoking and reduce their cigarette consumption\" even \"among those not intending to quit and rejecting other support.\"\nAnd research from \nFrance's Health Baromete\nr, which conducted telephone interviews with over 15,000 people, finds that e-cigs \"could have helped several hundreds of thousands\" quit smoking, at least temporarily. \n2016 headline: Vaping a gateway to tobacco use\nIn late January, BMJ published\n a study\n (PDF) that quizzed more than 2,000 Hawaiian ninth- and 10th-graders about their e-cigarette and traditional cigarette use, then followed up a year later.  Nearly all of the teens (98%) knew about vaping, and 68% considered e-cigarettes to be healthier than smoking.\nThey found that vapers were more than three times as likely to have begun smoking cigarettes by the next year compared with \"never smokers.\" The study also found the effect of e-cigarettes was independent of other factors that encourage teens to pick up the habit, such as rebelliousness and lack of parental support. \nWhile the study showed any level of vaping led to some cigarette use, it was the heavy vapers who were more likely to become regular cigarette smokers.", "AIDS in the '80s: The rise of a new civil rights movement": "It was the height of the AIDS epidemic. Peel said he would sometimes attend two or three funerals for friends in a week. People were getting sick, deathly sick, long before the disease even had a name. \nHis journals from the time capture this loss and hint at fear people had of the disease and of his community. Not knowing how it spread, people in the 1980s worried that they'd get sick from holding hands or catch the disease from a public toilet seat. There were no tests and no real treatments. The disease struck so many young men so quickly, and it seemed to target the gay community, so much that its first name was gay-related immune deficiency. Some just called it \"gay cancer.\"\nHollywood's struggle to deal with AIDS in the '80s\nPeel's journal also documents his growing desire to be an activist. In the 1980s, people were so afraid of the disease, nurses refused to take in meals to hospitalized patients. Doctors \nin major medical journals\n debated whether they had a moral obligation to treat people with AIDS. Parents refused to see their sick children, and faith communities called patients with HIV an \"abomination.\" Peel and others like him helped start organizations that would fill in the gaps of care.\nPeel donated his journals to a special collection at the \nStuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University\n in Atlanta. The collection of \npersonal papers and mementos\n from the AIDS movement, part of a broader LGBT collection, gives readers an intimate glimpse of the epidemic as it unfolded and as the LGBT movement gained momentum.\nSan Francisco and New York will always be inextricably linked to the early AIDS movement, but people in Atlanta also played a unique role, one that's often overlooked. The city is home to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n, which, in 1981,\n first documented \nwhat was then a mysterious disease. Some members of the Reagan administration famously refused to even mention the word AIDS until 1985, and by then, the epidemic was too big to ignore, with 15,948 cases. It was the CDC that created a hotline to answer scared people's questions. The agency tracked case numbers and developed research to better understand the virus.\nHIV in the '80s: 'People didn't want to kiss you on the cheek'\nIn 1989, Atlanta-based \nNexus Press\n hosted what is believed to be the first art exhibition in the United States to focus solely on AIDS. It was an Atlanta theater that, in 1984, staged what is thought to be the first AIDS-themed play, \"Warren.\" \nRebecca Ranson's \noriginal manuscript, which is housed at the Emory archive, tells a story about her friend who was dying from the disease and how she, a lesbian, and other friends tried to help. The play was performed throughout the country and at the CDC's first International conference about AIDS held in Atlanta in 1985. It aimed to educate a broader public that might have had little firsthand experience with the epidemic. The program lists AIDS organizations and their phone numbers on the back. \nAnd it was an Atlantan who was at the heart of the \ngay rights case Bowers v. Hardwick\n. An officer arrested Michael Hardwick for sodomy after the officer observed Hardwick having sex with another man in his own bedroom. The 1986 U.S. Supreme Court decision declared Georgia laws that prohibited sodomy constitutional. \nIn 2003\n, the Supreme Court reversed that decision. Hardwick died in 1991 due to complications from AIDS.\nAnger over the case inspired some in the local community to get more involved in organizing public protests such as the 1987 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. The march was attended by more than 200,000 and was the largest of its kind at the time. The program from the march, also housed at the archive, \ncalls for a national response\n to increase funding for AIDS research and asks for an end to discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS. Some of the local organizers pictured in the program would later become a part of the city's political establishment.\nPeel said AIDS in the 1980s changed Atlanta. The city was always a magnet for LGBT individuals who left their smaller towns for the more liberated city, but before the epidemic, \"for many guys, it was all about sex, drugs, and rock and roll,\" it wasn't about being a part of a broader civil rights movement, Peel \ntold an interviewer. \nThe disease and the public's reaction to it changed that.\n\"We didn't have a gay center then or much in the way of gay organizations. We had to make them up as we went along, and people came together to take care of their friends who were sick and dying,\" he said. \"As the epidemic unfolded, it began to bring people together.\"  ", "Can your address predict your premature death?": "The 2016 \nCounty Health Rankings\n, released Wednesday, compare health disparities among nearly all the counties in the country on the basis of more than 30 factors, including education, housing, exercise and commuting time. The report shows dramatic differences between rural and urban counties on a number of measures, most notably premature death rates.\nRural counties have higher rates of smoking, obesity, child poverty and teen births, as well as higher numbers of uninsured adults than their urban counterparts, according to the report, a collaboration between the \nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation\n and the \nUniversity of Wisconsin Population Health Institute\n. Large urban counties have lower smoking and obesity rates, fewer injury deaths and more residents who attended some college.\n\"What we think is going on here is that ... in rural areas, there is a smaller population, fewer businesses, fewer taxes -- and they're struggling to offer as many opportunities as urban,\" said lead researcher Bridget Catlin. \"All of this has a significant impact on health.\"\nThere are 3,141 counties (and county equivalents) in the United States, according to the \nU.S. Geological Survey\n. Catlin's team ranked all but about 100, explaining that if a county's population is too small, it's difficult to get reliable data; the numbers fluctuate so wildly that publishing them could be misleading.\nFurthermore, Catlin's team only ranks counties within states and does not make a list of the most and least healthy counties in the country. That's because it's most helpful for communities to compare themselves with others in their own state, operating in the same geopolitical and cultural environment, she said.\n\"Urban residents definitely have better access to health care, but there's far more to good health than just that,\" said Catlin. \"People have an impression of rural areas as healthy living and the great outdoors, but there aren't sidewalks. It can actually be more difficult to get out and exercise. Urban can offer more recreation facilities and more safe options.\"\n\"Rural populations are also aging faster than urban areas,\" said Catlin. \"Younger people who do go to college and leave home -- many of them don't return back home. What's left is an older population in the rural areas.\"\nRural counties have consistently had the highest premature death rates and, following a few years of improvement, overall rates of premature death are increasing there, according to the report. In fact, nearly one in five rural counties have experienced worsening premature death rates since the late 1990s. Large urban counties have seen the greatest declines in premature death rates, with nearly all showing consistently improved rates. \nThere is no single factor that explains the significant differences in health between rural and smaller metro, large suburban and large urban counties, according to the researchers.\nCatlin's team defined premature death as death by any means before the age of 75. \"We look at the number of years of life lost and more heavily weight deaths at an earlier age, because they're typically more preventable,\" said Catlin. \"When a child dies, you've lost their whole life ahead of them. At 74, you haven't lost as much as a society,\" to take nothing away from the pain and suffering endured by family and friends. \"At some point, we're all going to die from something,\" she said.\n\"This is one where we weren't very surprised,\" said Catlin. \"A lot of people have been talking about this. It's in selected places. We wanted to get out the information more broadly, so more people become aware of this epidemic.\"\nThe average rate of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. is 13 per 100,000 people, according to the report. That includes unintentional, intentional and undetermined poisoning by, and exposure to, prescription, over-the-counter or illegal drugs. Drug overdose deaths appear highest in northern Appalachia and in parts of the West/Southwest, lowest in the Northeast and higher in rural counties than in other types of counties.\n\"This is an issue that affects everybody, from all walks of life, and there are things that can be done about this,\" said Catlin. \"We don't have to sit back and watch this happen. There are things every community can do to save lives, such as tracking prescriptions, safe disposal of drugs, increased access to prescription medicine that can reduce overdoses, and more training of first responders (on) how to administer those drugs.\"\nPerhaps most important, she said, is increasing access to mental health services.\n\"I was surprised to see these numbers -- 1 out of 3 adults don't get enough sleep,\" said Catlin. \"That's a lot of people!\"\nOn average, the report said, 33% of adults do not get enough sleep, getting fewer than 7 hours per night, on average. Rates of insufficient sleep appear highest in the Southeast. Residents of the Plains states seem to get the best sleep.\n\"Sleep is absolutely key to overall health, lost productivity at work, stress, depression and motor vehicle crashes,\" said Catlin. \"There are things we can do as individuals to increase the amount of sleep we get. Beyond individuals, there are things a county can do, like help people who work long hours to support their families and reduce the need for working multiple jobs to earn a sustainable living, by increasing wages.\"\n\"Primary care physicians don't necessarily ask us about sleep,\" said Catlin. \"Some schools are shifting the school day or delaying start time for middle and high school, because we're learning kids have different circadian rhythms. Employers that run workplaces 24/7 can support better sleep, with things like napping rooms.\"\n\"Because of historical policies and things like that, we've ended up with various groups living segregated from others,\" Catlin said. \"Particularly for blacks and somewhat for Hispanics too, when they end up in segregated neighborhoods, we see lower housing quality, higher concentration of poverty, less access to quality jobs and education, and less access to a public transit system that allows them to access other opportunities. When living in conditions like this, people experience greater stress, and therefore a higher incidence of illness and death.\"\nThe study found the most extreme residential segregation in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions, and the most integrated counties along the Southeastern seaboard.\nThe authors note it's important to consider that for some population groups, such as new immigrants, living among others who share their cultural beliefs and practices can help build social connections that can lessen the health risks of hardship and neighborhood disadvantage.\nSearching for solutions\n\"Ranking communities ... is appealing to Americans' competitive nature,\" said Catlin. \"The whole point of it is to start conversations that lead to actions that help people live healthier lives. The things we can do on our own are so much easier to do if you live in a supportive community where there are opportunities all around you to make the healthy choice.\"\nCatlin and her team hope the rankings and raw data will help communities figure out what they're doing well and where they have room to improve.\nThe County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program also has an action center to help people get involved, called \nWhat Works for Health\n. \"We don't just provide the names of the strategies,\" said Caltin. \"We've gone into the scientific literature. We looked at the evidence on how well things work, and provide summary ratings and sources, so a community can choose to select something that has been shown to work in other places. But remember, not every strategy works in every community.\"\nThere are things you can do at home with your own kids, said Catlin, such as eating with, reading to and playing with them. You can join the local PTA, get involved in your neighborhood association or encourage your employer to offer workplace wellness activities. You can also reach out to your local policymakers to request and initiate change.\nAt the end of the day, it's healthy individuals who make up a healthy community, but also a healthy community that affords us the opportunity to get and stay healthy in the first place.", "What would it take to become a real-life superhero?": "Technologically speaking, becoming Iron Man could be feasible by enhancing your strength through a mechanical device, especially in comparison to becoming Captain America. Modifying your makeup through gene therapy or the next generation of steroids faces more ethical challenges -- as well as scientific limitations.\nScience fiction and science fact have long shared an \ninterchangeable dialogue of inspiring each other\n. \n\"(They) provide inspiration and whimsy,\" said Gary May, dean of the College of Engineering at the \nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n. \"We can enable ourselves to achieve what we couldn't before.\" \nCNN spoke to experts in the field to learn the science behind a few of the superheroes featured in the next installment of the Marvel movie franchise -- and what would happen if one of their origin stories happened to you. \nWhat if you were bitten by a radioactive spider?\nThis is technically the safest way to become a superhero, according to \nMichael Dennin\n, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Irvine. In his classes, Dennin often uses superheroes to explain the language and  processes of science. \nIf you were to encounter such a spider, \"the radioactivity will be relatively low and won't transmit much to you,\" Dennin said. \"It would do almost nothing to you. Maybe a few genetic mutations occur in isolated genes, but it will be more random than anything.\"\nDennin believes the impact would be greater if you were bitten by a normal spider carrying a retrovirus. A bite would transfer the virus, which could replicate within the body to make a noticeable difference. Hopefully, it's a good retrovirus that will allow you to scale walls. \nWhat if you were exposed to gamma radiation?\nOn the chance that you're exposed to gamma radiation, like Dr. Bruce Banner, the good news is that you most definitely would not turn green and transform into a Hulk.\nRadiation is known to create some useful mutations, like those working in conjunction with chemotherapy. In your quest for invulnerability, it is entirely possible that you could change the chemical makeup of your cells through radiation. However, it requires only the conversion of some of your cells by harmful radiation for you to die, Dennin said. \nCan we create a real Captain America?\nWe have ways of changing someone's muscle mass through anabolic steroids, but how strong can a person become until they break? \nFundamental limits are the barrier, not limitations on what is possible through physics or bioengineering, Dennin said. \nSuppose we create a serum or a pill that could be given to human subjects. In a developing body, like that of a child, cells are rapidly growing and changing, meaning this might work -- although it's definitely not recommended. \n\"But how does it happen quickly in a person who is already grown, and without their immune system kicking in to combat it?\" Dennin asked.\nAnother option is gene therapy, in which genes are inserted into someone's cells rather than using drugs or surgery. This experimental technique is undergoing trials to treat or prevent disease. \nBut even with the success of the\n Human Genome Project \nin sequencing our DNA, learning which genes rule muscle growth and performance is still very complicated, according to UC Davis professor Ricardo Castro, who also teaches a superhero science course. \nIn a \n2012 double muscling study in cattle\n (PDF), it was discovered that breeds like the Belgian Blue lack a gene inhibiting muscle growth. Researchers were able to replicate this in mice, and it caused them to become four times bigger. Studying that for use in humans could improve our ability to grow muscles. \nBut what would the side effects be? \nAdding hormones, like those present in steroids, to the mix could cause even more unexpected reactions, Castro said. \nThe suit makes the man\nThe Winter Soldier uses his metal arm largely as a weapon, but it also serves as a prosthetic after he lost an arm trying to assist Captain America with sabotaging Hydra operations in 1943. \nRecently, researchers were excited to share that implanting a computer chip in a paralyzed man's brain enabled him to \nregain control of his right hand \nand fingers. \n \"With better brain-to-robot control, it's a testament to the flexibility of the brain and advancing technology,\" Dennin said.\nSimilarly, we have the capability for \nmind-controlled exoskeletons\n that are helping \nveterans\n and those with disabilities to walk again.\nBut replicating Iron Man's suit presents some fundamental limits. \n\"Think of his suit like a small car,\" Dennin said. The suit generates heat and processes a lot of energy, creating issues of how to power it in a way that is both lightweight and sustainable, all while preventing it from melting due to the amount of energy it consumes. \nHowever, Tony Stark's arc reactor, which has acted as both a power source and a modified pacemaker (in this capacity, until the end of \"Iron Man 3\"), is possible, Castro said. The arc reactor relies on radioactive decay, breaking down palladium into silver, which creates beta radiation. Beta radiation can be blocked, so it isn't harming the person wearing the reactor. The reactor would contain a mini accelerator that traps high-energy electrons moving in circles, so they don't transcend onto the body. \nAs for Tony Stark's AI assistant Jarvis, \nMark Zuckerberg\n is already working on coding his own. \nKa-pow! Packing a superhero punch\nImagine the impact of Captain America and Winter Soldier trading punches with Iron Man. ER doctors weighed in on the effect of such devastating blows. \n\"If Iron Man puts his body behind the punch and uses the mass of the suit to create extra force, it would do more than knock (Captain America) on his back,\" said Dr. Al Sacchetti at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, NJ. \n\"The sternum will most likely fracture into multiple pieces, with these fragments being propelled backwards,\" added Dr. Todd Taylor  at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.  \"(This would) result in instantaneous massive hemorrhage. With no blood being delivered to nor blood exiting the heart, cardiovascular collapse would occur within seconds and death resulting in approximately one to two minutes.\" Captain America would need to use those razor-sharp reflexes of his to swiftly move out of the way.\nBut the worst outcome would be if you received the punch yourself. \"A punch from a superhero would probably pop us like a pi\u00f1ata, though I doubt candy would fall out,\" said Dr. Ryan Stanton, an emergency physician in Lexington, KY.\nWhether you're Team Iron Man or Team Captain America, it sounds like better reflexes like Spidey-sense are what everyone needs.", "Wig-free portraits empower women": "He considered photos of them wearing their wigs, or trying on several wigs. Finally, he asked a woman if she would be willing to remove her wig entirely. \nIt was a crucial moment, he said. It was an unusual request, but she did it.\nThe Berlin-based photographer can't say exactly what happened -- maybe it was the clarity with which he could see her eyes and face -- but the images were captivating. From then on, he asked all of the women featured in his portrait series, \"Unfading,\" to remove their wigs and reveal bald heads or patchy scalps or smooth foreheads with no eyebrows.\n\"I was really happy for people to trust me to do this,\" said Soeder, who photographed the women last year in the United Kingdom. \"They were showing an identity that is completely invisible to other people.\"\nMore than 6.6 million people in the United States and 147 million people worldwide have or will develop alopecia areata, according to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. For some, hair falls out in clumps, then grows back, only to fall out again. Others lose hair from their head, eyelashes and eyebrows. People with alopecia are often mistaken for cancer patients, but the condition isn't life-threatening and many people with alopecia are healthy otherwise. \nStill, its effects can be isolating and emotionally painful. Soeder photographed a dozen women, ranging from their 20s to their 60s, and one said she had never before met another person with the condition.\nAlopecia \"really seems like a threat to their sense of identity,\" Soeder said. \"After (hair loss), it's the process of overcoming that. It goes at different speeds for everyone.\"\nHair loss can be especially difficult for women, Soeder said, and many tried to hide it. He met the subjects for his series through the organization Alopecia UK, and some had tattooed eyebrows and collections of wigs and scarves. A couple said they never took their wigs off in front of others.\nIn Soeder's portraits, the women stand wig-free, with polished makeup and bright, solid-colored backgrounds. \n\"Even though it's very uniform and repetitive, in a way ... it really emphasizes people's individuality,\" he said. \"It just increases their uniqueness.\"\nThe women were instantly able to see their images on Soeder's computer. He worried it would make them self-conscious. Instead, it seemed to empower them.\n\"It made people feel confident,\" he said. \"The whole photography process is transparent. There's nothing that happens in between. I think that made the process easier and more interesting, because it was a dialogue.\"\nHe hopes this project will reveal to everyone how important it is to accept who you are. One woman told Soeder that before she removed her wig and posed, she'd never before had a beautiful photo of herself. \nFor many of the subjects, \"an inner strength is revealed which is both astounding and beautiful,\" said Gwennan Thomas, a volunteer with Alopecia UK who's No. 5 in the gallery above. \"When faced with adversity, one can make a choice. You decide on the path you take.\"", "CTE in the NFL: The tragedy of Fred McNeill": "Yet the very same game had robbed so much from him. \nMcNeill had transitioned from playing 12 years of professional football into family life. He had a wife, Tia, and two young sons, Fred Jr. and Gavin. After playing in two Super Bowls, he spent his last NFL season studying law and eventually became a partner with a firm in Minneapolis. \nMcNeill was easygoing and kind. His older son, Fred Jr., remembers him as \"our first best friend. He was Superman.\" Gavin said he coached them in all things: football, baseball, basketball, life.  \nAs his wife said, \"Fred did everything. He played ball, went to law school, prepared for life after football. We had the kids. It was a good life, and then it changed.\" \nSmall changes at home and work\nAt first the changes were small. McNeill began forgetting to pick up the kids from school. Then he began having difficulty concentrating and completing tasks. At times he would jump up out of bed in the middle of the night because of nightmares. \nHe also began complaining of headaches. \"I'd see him wince, and I'd go, 'What's going on?' \" Tia McNeill said. \"He just said, 'Oh nothing. Just in my head. Maybe I need to drink.' \" He was always saying, \"I need to drink some more water.\"\nSimilar issues were happening at work. One of his law partners, \nBarry Reed, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune\n, \"It became more and more difficult for him to function as a lawyer.\" Fred McNeill eventually lost his partnership at the firm. \nHis personality started changing, too. Fred Jr. said his dad was normally easygoing, calm, collected. But there would be moments when his dad would suddenly lose his temper and punch a hole in the wall. \nHe initially attributed his dad's behavior to marital problems but realizes now it was something more. \"I look back, we realize that was the first sign of that rage and that frustration of him not being able to be himself and not being able to remember things,\" the son said. \nGavin remembers when a pickup game of basketball became something more: \"We were always competitive in basketball, but this time I was really kind of getting on him, beating him. We kind of got into an argument while playing, and he started getting aggressive with me, while playing, pushing me.\" Gavin walked away, not knowing if his father was in control of the situation. \nWhen Tia McNeill would ask her husband a question, and he didn't know the answer, he would become defensive. He would say, \"You just think I'm stupid,\" she recalled.\nFred McNeill was only in his mid 40s, but memory issues and anger were becoming more and more constant. It was taking a toll on the family and himself. He and his wife separated. They filed for bankruptcy. They lost their home. \nGavin remembers feeling adrift, like they had lost their anchor. \"There are some times where the father is the stronghold in the family, or the anchor. If you lose that, everything kind of falls apart. That's kind of what happened for us. It looked like financial issues at first; it looked like marital issues, and they separated; then it looked like just depression.\" \nAnswers to the mystery\nAt the time, they had no idea that it was all because of football. \"When Fred was playing, the worse we ever thought an injury would be would be some major spinal type thing, where they're carried off in paralysis. That was your worst fear, sitting in the stands. But this? We didn't know. We didn't see it coming,\" Tia McNeill said. \nShe did her own online research into brain injury and football. She came across the name of Dr. Bennet Omalu and \na disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE\n. She reached out, and he called back. She would begin to tell Omalu of her husband's unusual behavior, and the doctor would finish her sentences. \nOmalu remembers spending about 30 minutes on the phone with her, discussing these behaviors, and he said to her, \"You know what? I could bet my life your husband has CTE.\" \nFor Tia McNeill, all of the unpredictability finally made sense. \"I was seeking answers, but everything (Omalu) said made perfect sense,\" she said. \nCTE is football's bogeyman. Researchers aren't sure exactly what makes some players susceptible to the disease and others not. Factors such as genetics and age of first impact may play a role.\nBut what is clear for many researchers is that it occurs because of repeated head trauma that results in a buildup of an abnormal protein called tau. The tangles of tau can overtake parts of the brain that control for memory, mood and aggression. The symptoms are similar to Alzheimer's but begin much earlier. There are four stages of the disease, and the most severe cases can result in suicidal thoughts. \nFred Jr.  remembers hearing the headlines of other players. \nDave Duerson\n, \nJunior Seau\n and \nMike Webster\n all seemed to have parallels to his father's life. \"That's when you start to realize -- OK, yeah, the rage, the forgetfulness, the identity crisis,\" he said.\nGavin even talked to his father about suicide, and his dad brushed it off. \"'I'm not going to do that, nah, nah,' just joking around,\" Gavin recalled. It's a conversation no son should have with their father. All Gavin could say was, \"I hope you wouldn't. I love you. Just know that. If you hear me, hear that first.\"\nCTE has no cure. It can only be diagnosed with an autopsy. Tia McNeill had no idea at the time what her husband's future looked like, but she knew that when he passed, she would have Omalu evaluate his brain. \"We wanted to know,\" she said. \nDiagnosing the living\nIn 2012, Omalu approached the McNeills with a new technology that he had helped developed and is invested in. Called \nTauMark\n, it uses a radioactive \"tracer\" called FDDNP to bind to tau proteins in the brain. The tau proteins can then be seen on a positron emission tomography, or PET scan. Omalu explained to CNN that this technology could only be licensed to corporations and that his motive behind it is not profit but research.\nWhen Omalu and his team examined the scan, there were angry red splotches all over Fred McNeill's brain. His wife wasn't surprised. \nCritics say the test is too early. It's only been used on \n14 former football players\n. But more importantly, they say it isn't precise enough. It binds to tau as well as amyloid proteins, a signature for Alzheimer's. \nOmalu said it's not just what the marker is highlighting, but where the highlights are. Tau has a distinctive pattern in CTE, and Omalu said his test is tracing the tau in the same places he's found it in autopsies. \nMeanwhile, McNeill's dementia continued to worsen. His outbursts became more extreme. Ultimately, the family moved him into an assisted living facility. \"It was more for his safety,\" Tia McNeill said. \nA different kind of care\nFred McNeill found a home at the Silverado Beverly Memory Care Community in Los Angeles a few blocks from Gavin's office and minutes away from his wife's home. Silverado is one of the NFL's two preferred providers of memory care. \nIt was the best care they could find, but Tia McNeill said it was never a perfect fit.  \nThere were 70-, 80-, 90-year-olds at the facility, and Fred McNeill was just in his early 60s, still relatively fit. He wanted to walk, throw around footballs. He loved music and karaoke. Former NFL players need a different kind of care, Tia McNeill contends.\nSylvia Mackey, wife of \nHall of Famer John Mackey\n, agrees. She wrote a letter to then-NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue about caring for her husband's dementia. The letter was the impetus to form the \n88 Plan\n, the NFL's benefit plan for players experiencing dementia, Lou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's. Sylvia Mackey gets calls from NFL wives all the time about what to look for and what they can do to help their husbands. \nShe recalled when her husband entered a nursing home, surrounded by folks in wheelchairs, who could barely get around. She remembers him pushing the other residents in their wheelchairs. \nShe said it wasn't just the age difference, but the pure physical difference of the former football players. They need larger beds and larger equipment. \n\"As the disease progresses and they become less mobile, they need lift chairs, things they need to help them move around. And the staff can't shoulder that physically themselves. They need equipment to help,\" Mackey said. \nShe also said the former athletes still identify as players, brothers of a certain bond. \nTia McNeill agrees. She said her husband lit up when he found out Manfred Moore, a former pro football player, was also at Silverado. The two had played college football against each other when Fred McNeill was at UCLA and Moore at rival USC. \nIt's not clear how many former players are now in assisted living facilities. In 2014, Loren Shook, president and CEO of Silverado, told the \nChicago Sun Times,\n \"We have treated about 20 NFL players -- we have about a dozen right now.\" CNN has reached out to the NFL Retired Players Association but has not heard back. \nHowever, through the NFL Alumni Association, Sylvia Mackey is now working with Validus Senior Living to open an assisted living facility in all 33 NFL cities. Each facility would work with a younger, and healthier, population, dealing with dementia. \n\"There's no road map. There's no support for this,\" Tia McNeill said. \"There's no protocol when you're afflicted with CTE -- what it looks like and how to care for that person best.\" She wants there to be more. \nA final blow\nIn March 2014, Fred McNeill was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Studies have found that former professional football players are \nfour times more\n likely to suffer neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. McNeill's hands had become shaky; he was losing control from the waist up. \nHe eventually was put on feeding tubes because he couldn't eat. \nOn November 2, McNeill's family brought him home from the hospital. They wanted him to enjoy his last days in peace. \"We brought him home on a Monday morning, and he passed. ... He wasn't here 24 hours,\" Tia McNeill recalled. \n\"To me, that was kind of like his third time dying because he passed when he started to get the dementia,\"  Gavin said. \"When we found out about the ALS and it was even more rapid and degenerative and we knew eventually his heart or lungs would go, it was like he died again, because now the clock was ticking. Then when he eventually passed, it was stunning,\" \nWhen Omalu presented his autopsy findings to the McNeills, they weren't surprised. The doctor's examination confirmed what he found in his experimental test, making Fred McNeill potentially the first person in the world to be diagnosed with CTE before death.\nFor the McNeills, it confirmed everything they went through. But do they blame the NFL? No. \n\"Our family does not place blame anywhere,\" Tia McNeill said. \"What I'm holding onto is that I want to continue this dialogue and the information, and the awareness is important, and that's one of the things that I just have to do.\"\nShe's working with the \nBennet Omalu Foundation\n to support other families experiencing CTE and help make sense of what they are going through. \nFollow CNN Health on \nFacebook\n and \nTwitter\n.", "Beyond the mirror: How one woman learned to love herself": "Each week, CNN profiles people who have faced a dramatic turning point in their life.

She had gained weight.\nBut for Collins, this was a struggle all too familiar: A lifelong battle with her body image, beginning at a young age. By middle school, she was already more developed than most of her friends. As an athlete, she hated going into the locker room. She always wore two sports bras to avoid attracting more attention.\n\"I'm a big person, I've never been called petite,\" she recalls. \nAfter becoming pregnant unexpectedly and having a baby in high school, her already fragile self-esteem plummeted. It became excruciating to look at herself. She showered with the lights off and avoided mirrors altogether.\nShe didn't welcome the body reflected back at her, \"so I chose to hate it instead,\" she said.\nHer hatred fueled an obsessive exercise regimen in college. She attended West Georgia University on a volleyball scholarship, but she pushed herself. She ran hills and lifted weights with little sleep. She drank energy drinks and attempted crash diets. \nShe was haunted by thoughts from other women: That her life -- and her body -- would be ruined after becoming a mother.\n\"I did not and would not accept it,\" she said.\nHer friends, young and thin with \"smooth, unmarked skin\" became painful reminders. Collins was grieving for a body she never had. \n\"I felt a deep sense of loss and shame that I'd somehow missed the opportunity to enjoy my youth and womanhood,\" she said.\nAfter college, her unhealthy habits translated into corporate life. She swapped exercise for long work days, staving off fatigue with a combination of junk food and fat burners.\nChanging focus\nAfter struggling to find that picture to post to Facebook in 2012, she reached a turning point.\nFor the first time in her life, instead of questioning why she looked a certain way, she asked herself something else: \"It was more important to me to figure out, why do I feel this way?\" she said.\nHer feelings of disrespect for her body were wrapped up in years of punishing it. \n\"I think we have to get away from thinking that there is merit in punishment,\" she said. \"This is not my body's fault.\"\nBut her lifestyle didn't change overnight. \"I didn't wake up and love quinoa and skinless chicken,\" she admits.\nAnd she's not an expert, she says. \"It's OK to raise your hand and say, 'I'm really nervous, I don't know where to get started.'\"\nCollins is a big believer in an \"80% nutrition, 20% fitness\" mindset.

No self-inflicted deprivation.\n\"What success is there in eating kale and struggling through a 6 a.m. boot camp if you're miserable in the process?\"\nBut it's not just about being healthy, it's about being honest with yourself. \"Be vulnerable and say, you know, I don't feel my best, but where does that come from?\"\nMore than the dress\nCollins, now 30, is preparing her daughter for middle school. She remembers her struggle as a young woman, and she hopes to create a different environment for her daughter.\n\"She is beautiful and special and lovely. I want to talk to myself the same way I talk to her,\" she says.\n\"What if we raised our daughters to accept compliments? That they are beautiful. It doesn't mean flawless, it means beautiful.\"\nCollins is also preparing for a wedding -- her own. Getting married means visiting bridal shops, fitting rooms. It also means looking in the mirror. A fear she's held on to since adolescence has come full circle.\nThe way Collins sees herself know, it's hard to see the battle she fought for herself. She is \"beautiful and special and lovely,\" she says. \n\"There is no mirror, no scale, no dress, and no person that will ever be more powerful in shaping the love you feel for yourself than the person who is reflected right back at you.\"", "CNN's 'Prescription Addiction' town hall in 90 seconds.": "", "Meet the dogs that can sniff out cancer better than some lab tests": "But her owners knew their smart dog held promise. They decided, if her nose was getting her into trouble (she was after all, bred to be a hunting dog), why not train her to sniff out something useful?\nFor the next seven years, Lucy learned to sniff out bladder, kidney and prostate cancer, and was even used in a study. Over the years, she has been able to detect cancer correctly more than 95% of the time. That's better than some lab tests used to diagnose cancer.\nNow, Lucy is part of one of the largest clinical trials of canine cancer detection. A British organization, \nMedical Detection Dogs\n, has eight dogs sniff out 3,000 urine samples from National Health Service patients to see whether they can discern who has cancer and who doesn't.\nClaire Guest is the CEO of Medical Detection Dogs. Her fox red Labrador, Daisy, caught her breast cancer six years ago when she was 45. \"She kept staring at me and lunging into my chest. It led me to find a lump,\" Guest remembers.\nThe tumor was deep in her breast. Her doctors said that by the time she would have felt it herself, the cancer would have been very advanced.\n\"Had it not been drawn to my attention by Daisy, I'm told my prognosis would have been very poor,\" she said.\nDogs have two 'noses'\nDogs' powerful noses have 300 million sensors, compared with a human's measly 5 million. In addition, dogs have a second smelling device in the backs of their noses that we don't have, called Jacobson's organ.\nThat double smelling system allows trained dogs to detect cancer's unique odors, called volatile organic compounds.\nIt took humans thousands of years to figure this out. In 1989, doctors at King's College Hospital in London wrote in The Lancet about a woman whose dog persisted in smelling a particular mole on her leg. That mole turned out to be early-stage malignant melanoma.\nOver the next 26 years, studies from France to California to Italy have concluded that dogs really can detect the smell of cancer.\nResearchers in the current British study have set a particularly high bar. They want to make sure dogs are actually smelling cancer and not something else, such as old age or a particular set of symptoms.\nIn the study, dogs will circle a carousel holding eight evenly spaced urine samples, one from a cancer patient and seven from patients who don't have cancer. At least one of those seven samples will be from someone about the same age as the cancer patient who had symptoms of cancer but didn't actually have the disease.\nGuest, whose group is running the study, said that if studies like hers continue to show the power of dogs' noses, the animals might one day be used in conjunction with existing diagnostic tests, not instead of them. Scientists might also design a machine -- an \"electronic nose\" -- that mimics a dog's powerful smelling abilities. \"It's very feasible,\" Guest said.\nDampened enthusiasm\nBut more then 25 years later, the awesome smelling powers of dogs has not met with commercial success.\nDr. Sheryl Gabram thinks she knows why. The Emory University surgeon published a study four years ago showing that a machine, like a dog, could reliably detect the smell of breast cancer from patients' breath samples. Excited about their success, her team sought money for more studies. They failed.\n\"We submitted everywhere and could never get it funded to move the research any further,\" said Gabram, the surgeon-in-chief at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and director of the hospital's AVON Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center.\nThe problem, she thinks, is that while cancer-smelling dogs (or machines) make for great headlines -- one of her own patients received a great deal of publicity -- it's not always easy to envision how sniffing out cancer could be used commercially.\n\"It would need a lot of years of study and a lot of development,\" she said. \"It's still far from that. People just thought it was too massive to embark on.\" It's too bad, too, she said, because \"I think it's an area of research that's still promising.\"\nFollow CNN Health on \nFacebook\n and \nTwitter.", "The secret Cold War origins of Sharapova's drug": "Back in the Soviet Union's heyday, scientists tested meldonium on athletes in clandestine state-run labs, according to Ivar Kalvins, the Latvian chemist who invented the drug. \nKalvins asserts that decades ago he was shown the results of those tests, and they support what Sharapova has told the world: Meldonium is medicinal, not performance-enhancing. \"Most athletes should be on this drug,\" he said. \"It protects the heart.\" \nBut he doesn't have the actual studies to support his claims. \n\"These trials were never published,\" Kalvins said, citing the secrecy of the era. He said the Soviets wouldn't even give him -- the inventor of the drug -- a copy of the results. \nThere's no use in trying to find the studies now, he added. Most of the people who were involved back in the 1980s \"are not with us in this world, and the rest, for sure will not speak about things,\" Kalvins told CNN. \"It is Russia still.\" \nDecades later, Kalvins' statements leave top U.S. doctors calling them -- to use a polite word -- baloney. \n'Pseudoscience and unsupportable claims' \nCardiologists interviewed by CNN said if Kalvins can't show the data, then there's no way of knowing if his drug does protect athletes' hearts from damage due to overexertion, as he said in an \ninterview\n with CNN. \n\"If you don't show your data, your claims might as well disappear into thin air, because they're not credible,\" said Dr. Aaron Baggish, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \nAccording to Dr. Steven Nissen, a former president of the American College of Cardiology, Kalvins' statements in that interview were \"filled with pseudoscience and unsupportable claims. It was almost humorous it was so over the top.\" \nNissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said there's no reason an elite athlete's heart needs protecting in the first place. \n\"She's 28 years old!\" he said, referring to Sharapova. \"The idea that her heart needs protecting -- it just doesn't make any scientific sense. The argument doesn't stand up to scientific scrutiny.\" \nBaggish, the cardiologist for the U.S. soccer and rowing teams, agrees. \n\"The prevailing science says the vast majority of athletes can push their heart to the limit and come out stronger,\" said Baggish, who directs the\n \nCardiovascular Performance Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"They can do as much activity as they want and not end up with heart failure.\" \nSeveral companies sell melodium under various names. In a statement, the original and major manufacturer of the drug, a Latvian pharmaceutical company called \nGrindeks\n, said the drug \"can stop tissue damage in the case of ischemia,\" or insufficient blood flow to the heart. \nKalvins, chairman of the scientific board of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, said the Soviet-era tests showed meldonium helped decrease the amounts of fatty acids going to the heart, which he said \"is safer for the heart.\"  \nHe added that he hasn't made any money off the drug since 2005, and even then he only made \"a little.\" \nDr. Paul Thompson, director of cardiology at Hartford Hospital and former president of the American College of Sports Medicine, also said he was dubious about the assertions that meldonium is helpful for athletes' hearts. \n\"It's very easy for the person who invented the drug to say it protects athletes' hearts. That's what you call a conflict of interest,\" he said. \"If I invented the drug, I'd say that, too.\" \nSharapova: One drug for many illnesses \nAt her \nMarch 7 press conference\n, Sharapova, who moved to the United States when she was 7, said she took Mildronate, a brand name for meldonium for various illnesses. \n\"I was given this medicine by my doctor for several health issues that I was having back in 2006. I was getting sick a lot. I was getting the flu every couple of months. I had irregular EKG results as well as indications of diabetes with a family history of diabetes,\" she said. \n\"(Mildronate) made me healthy, and that's why I continued to take it,\" she added. \nMildronate's manufacturer, \nGrindeks\n, does not include diabetes or influenza on its list of uses for the drug. \nThe drug has been approved in several former Soviet republics, such as Russia and Latvia, but not by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency, the European equivalent of the FDA. \nU.S. doctors interviewed for this article said they weren't familiar with the drug but said they were highly doubtful one medicine could treat all the complaints Sharapova mentioned. \n\"There's not a medication in the world that I know of that's going to treat that constellation of symptoms,\" Baggish said. \nNissen said only Sharapova and her doctor can explain why she was taking meldonium for so many different problems. \nAs for irregular electrocardiogram results, Mildronate does treat cardiac conditions, according to the manufacturer's website. But it's unclear what, if any, cardiac condition Sharapova has. \nAt her press conference, the tennis player didn't supply any more details beyond that she'd had the irregular EKG. Her attorney, John Haggerty, referred questions to Mary Jane Orman, a spokeswoman for IMG Tennis, which manages Sharapova. She declined to comment on the player's medical history. \nIrregular EKG results can mean nothing, cardiologists told CNN, especially for athletes. \n\"We've known for decades that athletes' hearts are different than the hearts of normal people,\" Baggish said. \"If you compare them to sedentary people, their results fall outside the limits of normal, but that doesn't mean anything is wrong.\" \nFor example, studies show between 30% and 50% of athletes will have abnormal EKGs compared with the rest of the population because they have left ventricular hypertrophy, he said. That means the left side of their heart is large, which isn't surprising given how much they exercise.\n\"The heart is a muscle. And so, like other muscles, it gets bigger if it is worked hard over time,\" according to the \nCleveland Clinic's website\n. \nSharapova is not alone\nSharapova may have put melodium on the map, but she's hardly the only athlete to have taken the drug, which the \nWorld Anti-Doping Agency\n banned starting at the beginning of the year.  \nAn analysis last year of 8,300 urine samples taken at doping control sessions revealed that 182 contained the drug, according to the \nPartnership for Clean Competition\n. \n\"There is an alarmingly high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes in sport,\" the report concluded. \nAt last year's European Games -- when meldonium was not on the banned list -- 66 out of 762 athletes tested positive for the drug, according to an article in the\n British Medical Journal.\n \nMeldonium was particularly popular among certain types of athletes. Nearly a third of the canoeists and kayakers and a little more than a quarter of the gymnasts in the report tested positive for the drug. \nDoes meldonium enhance athletic performance? \nAccording to the British Medical Journal article, meldonium might enhance athletic performance. \nThere's some evidence that the drug may benefit exercise performance in rats, according to the study authors, and in humans there have been reports that the drug improves blood flow to the heart and increases tolerance to stress. \n\"Consequently, the use by athletes could potentially result in enhanced personal performance and a shortening of the recovery period after physical activity,\" the authors wrote. \nThey added that the \"widespread use\" of the drug suggests \"there is some benefit being observed which is potentially perpetuating its use among athletes.\"\nGrindeks, the pharmaceutical company, said in a statement that \"meldonium cannot improve athletic performance\" and is therefore not a doping agent and should not have been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. \nBut Nissen, the cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said he wonders if perhaps it's all in the athletes' heads. \n\"The placebo effect is very powerful,\" he said. \"I can imagine how this plays out in the athletic world, where you're operating at the 99th percentile of human performance. Someone says, 'I can give you something that's going to make you a little bit better.' It's very tantalizing to try it.\" ", "Southern charm, deadly streets": "Known as the Hostess City, Savannah appears like a postcard of idyllic Southern charm. \nLinda Wilder-Bryan looks around and shakes her head. \n\"You can't walk like this in other neighborhoods,\" she says. \"Please share our tale of two cities. This is the Hostess City with bloody underwear. ... Nobody wants to air their bloody drawers.\"\nThen, she cries. \nIn August, her 23-year-old son, Lawrence Bryan IV, was shot and killed in a Savannah neighborhood where homicides are frequent. Two months later, the genteel safety of City Market was shattered when a 24-year-old man who Wilder-Bryan considered her second son was gunned down in the early hours. Police have said Frank Wilson was stalked and targeted.\nWilson's killing stoked fears that Savannah's escalating violence was moving from outlying neighborhoods into the tourist district. By year's end, 53 people -- a majority of them black -- had been killed, a 66% jump from the previous year and the bloodiest year since 1991, when the city recorded 60 homicides. \nWilder-Bryan admits that her son was no angel and had made mistakes in life. The night he was killed, he was playing cards and gambling at a home where police had responded to gunshots on prior occasions. In 2014, her son also had been \ncharged in connection with a gunfight\n. \n\"I'm consumed with death,\" she says. \"It's my norm now.\"\nDetermined to push for change, Wilder-Bryan, 58, ran for a City Council post in November on the slogan \"I'm gonna kick up dust and get rid of rust.\" She lost to the incumbent by about 3,600 votes but says the effort was worthwhile.\n\"Instead of grieving, I fought.\"\nShe and a group of mothers have formed a group called CHAOS, or Change Helping Agents of Savannah. They hold monthly die-ins and rallies across the city to raise awareness about the violence plaguing its black communities.\nShe once served as a state corrections officer and as security sergeant for the local sheriff's department and knows the inequalities of the justice system.\nA whirlwind of energy, Wilder-Bryan makes city leaders nervous. She's edgy, vocal and determined. But don't tell her that her son passed away or that she lost him.\nThere's no reason, she says, to sugarcoat a killing. \"My son wasn't lost. He was stolen.\"\nCalling in the parolees\nConcerned by the increased killings, the city of Savannah launched an ambitious initiative with a straightforward title: End Gun Violence. The program is modeled after one developed by David Kennedy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, whose practices have been implemented in dozens of cities across the country. \nCriminologists have found that a fraction of hardened criminals are responsible for a disproportionate amount of serious violent crimes. In a city Savannah's size, they say, the number of people committing the most violent offenses would be limited to just several dozen people. \nThe Kennedy model targets those individuals believed to be the most violent and brings them together with police and prosecutors for \"Call Ins.\" \nSavannah's first Call In was December 15 at a local church.\n\"If we can get a message to those people to reduce their gunfire exchange, then we will definitely impact the overall number,\" says Maxine Bryant, the project manager of the \nEnd Gun Violence initiative\n. \nCritics of the Kennedy model say cops are \npoor messengers given the black community's distrust of police\n. \nSupporters argue that there has to be a balance: police and community members working in conjunction. \nTo that end, the Call In featured a who's who of Savannah law enforcement, including Police Chief Joseph Lumpkin and District Attorney Meg Heap, along with a federal judge, preachers and other community members.\nTheir audience: 16 parolees who ranged in age from their late teens to their 30s. Two were women. Everyone was black. Each had served time for an array of drug and firearms offenses.   \nLaw enforcement delivered a stern message: Clean up or we're coming after you. And not only will we come after you, we'll go after your friends and anyone who knows what you're doing. \nIf the parolees aren't actively engaged in shootings, the thinking is, they know people who are and will carry the message into their communities.\nOne man sat slouched in his chair texting for much of the time. The young woman next to him followed his lead, rolling her head and acting as if she had better places to be. Others snapped to attention when told that federal authorities would come after them if they don't change. They know there's no parole in federal prison.\nThey were given a phone number for social services and told that help was available should they choose a new path.\nBut perhaps the strongest message came from Pam Abraham: one delivered from the heart of a grieving mother. \nHer 25-year-old son, Sean Abraham, was a manager at a fast-food restaurant in West Savannah. He'd graduated from Alabama State University and was the epitome of America's talented youth: optimistic, humble and proud. \nHe'd talk with friends and family about his dreams of setting up a foundation to help at-risk youth. He believed most troubled youth just needed proper mentors to help steer their anger and rage.  \nBut on February 7, 2004, her only son was shot in the head, killed over his cell phone. \nBefore she began speaking, she told the texting man to put his phone away. She showed a photograph of her son in a bright gold shirt, his face beaming with a smile that radiates all these years later. The picture was taken before Christmas in 2003. She buried her son two months later, on Valentine's Day. \nTime doesn't heal such pain, she said. \nShe reminded the group that her son's killer got three life sentences, plus 105 years. A man who was with him got two life sentences, plus 50 years. \n\"Three young men died that day.\"\nThis time, everyone sat upright, even the texter and the head-roller.\nChange your ways, she implored the group, because \"it's either prison or the grave.\"\nWhen she finished, two of the men hugged her. One told her he'd never thought about the pain he caused his mother. \n\"It was almost like a light bulb went on for some,\" she recalled. \"I always tell people: Yesterday, it was at my door. Tomorrow, it may be at yours. You need to step up and be part of the solution.\"\nDespite the new citywide initiative, the shootings have not abated. There have been 23 homicides this year, the same as for all of 2012 and nearly double the 13 at this time last year. The next Call In is slated for later this month.\nMayor Eddie DeLoach, who came into office in January, said that he believes the program is making progress but that it's too early to judge its overall effectiveness because crime reduction is \"not going to happen overnight.\" He said another new program is offering 500 jobs to rising high school seniors \"so they can pick something else other than trouble\" during the hot summer months. \nHe also said the police force has been hiring officers to fill a shortage that's existed for the past 16 years. By June, the mayor said, 127 new officers will be on the streets. \n\"We should have an opportunity there to put some pressure to bear on the malcontents that are causing problems in our community,\" he said. \"We're looking forward to a reduced crime rate. ... We're optimistic on our end.\"\nGetting people to talk\nRonald Williams keeps 58 pencils bound together by one rubber band as a symbol of the city he loves. Each pencil represents one of the 58 neighborhoods of Savannah, including his predominantly black neighborhood of West Savannah.\n\"You can't break it when they band together,\" he says.\nBut infighting for too long has been the city's reality, resulting in too few solutions and too many killings. \n\"I'm doing everything I can to tell people, 'Hey, we've got to live together.' \"\nWalk the streets with Williams, president of the West Savannah Community Organization, and you immediately see the inequities of two vastly different areas. About a mile from historic downtown, there are no pristine brick sidewalks in West Savannah. Here, dirt footpaths and cracked sidewalks -- barely wide enough for one person -- press up against the roads. Instead of giant live oaks dripping with Spanish moss, there are run-down bungalows and shotgun shacks set amid working-class ranch homes. \nOne tattered sign warns, \"No dumping -- This area is being monitored. Violators will be cited.\" Trash tossed from cars lies within feet of the post.  \nAround the corner from his office, he stops and points to the pavement where two people were gunned down last summer.  \"Two young men laid dead right up in here,\" he says.\nHe'd come across the scene while police were sealing off the area, the bodies still in the street.  Williams talked with onlookers and put the word out: If you're afraid to talk with police, come to me. Within two hours, he helped get leads on the suspects. \n\"That's what we've got to do: Get people to start speaking out,\" he says. \nWilliams is a foot soldier in this raging war. He's not armed with a gun. He's armed with knowledge, a broad smile and a friendly handshake. He walks the neighborhood constantly, to let people know about weekend get-togethers and other events.\nAt 69, Williams is a straight-talker. He gets upset when people discuss police shootings of African-Americans but don't talk about everyday crime destroying neighborhoods like his.\n\"Black-on-black crime is there. Why not talk about it?\" he says.\nHe's known to stop mothers with errant kids and tell them they need to buy insurance on their children \"so you don't have to go to GoFundMe to bury that child.\"\n\"When they're out there dealing drugs and other things, they've got two options: They're either going to die, or they're going to go to jail.\"\nHis criticism goes both ways: Too many police, he says, \"are not going to give me the respect that I deserve because of the color of my skin.\"\n\"Every black person is not a criminal, but that's what some young white police officers think.\"\nAs he walks through the neighborhood, residents wave from their porches. A local barber ushers him inside his shop and shows off a renovation project for a new nightclub in the back. \nThe vast majority of residents, he says, are like anywhere else: law-abiding, family-loving folks. But the drug trade, he says, is fueling the gun violence, and residents are largely powerless to stop it. \"The two biggest money-making trades in this city are tourists and drugs.\"\nAugusta Avenue serves as the main street through West Savannah. The mile-long stretch is bookended by two reminders of life here, one from the present and one from the past. \nTwo crosses stand as a makeshift memorial to mark the spot where a 29-year-old black man was killed by police in 2014. Just up the road, a plaque reads \"Largest Slave Sale in Georgia History: The Weeping Time.\" \n\"If you don't know your history,\" Williams says, \"you don't have a future.\"\nWilliams hopes for a brighter tomorrow. That if he and others can make inroads within the community, get people to speak out about crime, improve the education system and get youth to buy in, then change will come.\nBut it won't happen overnight. \n\"These are my people, and I love them,\" he says at the end of his tour.\nBy night's end, gunfire rings out. Another person dies.", "Discover a child's medical destiny before they're born": "Lo had discovered a \"treasure trove\" of valuable DNA floating freely in the bloodstream.\nHis breakthrough would one day make it possible for pregnant women to safely screen their unborn children for genetic conditions, to map out the entire genome of their fetus, and potentially screen all ages for cancer at its earliest stages. \nAll using a simple blood test. \nThe secrets in our blood\nLo's first discovery was that the DNA of an unborn baby floats freely in its mother's blood plasma -- the yellow liquid that holds blood cells in suspension. \nThat DNA, he knew, was a window into an unborn baby's health, and future. \nBut, at the time of his discovery, the medical world wasn't interested.\n\"They thought that you could only use it for sex selection,\" says Lo, now the Director of the \nLi Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences\n, in Hong Kong. This was deemed by experts to be a narrow application and one filled with ethical problems, according to Lo.\nThe medical world had missed what would become one of the 21st century's biggest breakthroughs.\nBut this didn't stop Lo.\nHis beginnings\nLo's quest to find fetal DNA in the mother's blood had begun at Oxford University, where he met pioneering scientist Professor John Bell.\n\"I heard him give a lecture about the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He said this technique would change the world,\" recalls Lo, now 52.\nPCR is a technique used to amplify a single piece of DNA into thousands, or even millions, of copies. \nLo learned how to use the cutting-edge technology, and soon after searched for a way to apply it.\nHis goal? A safer, non-invasive, test for Down syndrome.\nRemoving the risks\nThe traditional test for many mothers-to-be was to undergo a procedure called amniocentesis, where fluid is extracted from the amniotic liquid surrounding a baby in the womb. The cells within the fluid are then screened for health conditions, such as Down syndrome.\n\"A big needle had to be inserted through the mother's tummy into the uterus,\" says Lo.\nThe procedure carries an estimated 1 in 100 chance of causing a miscarriage, according to the \nUK National Health Service\n.\n\"I wondered, why did doctors do such a dangerous procedure? How about [we] just take a blood sample from the mother?\" says Lo.\nScience, however, had to catch up with his ambition: During this time as a student in the 1980s, the blood of a baby and its mother were believed to be separate.\nLo began an eight-year search for fetal DNA inside a mother's blood cells. But the number of fetal cells that enter this part of the maternal blood turned out to be very small, and the search had to be called off.\nIn 1997, it was time for a change.\nWritten in the molecules\nLo returned to Hong Kong in what became a historic year for both man and city: the British colony was returned to China and Lo would get his epiphany.\nThree months before his move, Lo had read about cancer patients found to have DNA from their tumors floating within their blood plasma. \nScientists had realized that dying tumor cells can release their DNA into the circulation of patients, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). This opened up the idea of non-invasive cancer diagnosis.\n\"I thought a baby growing inside a mother is like a cancer growing inside a patient -- except I've never seen an eight pound tumor,\" says Lo.\n\"If a small cancer can release enough DNA for us to see, maybe a baby can, too.\"\nHis goal required Lo to figure out just how to extract DNA from blood plasma -- and he found inspiration in an unlikely source.\n\"When I was in the UK, I would cook instant noodles, you boil the soup and add the noodle dish ... I thought the simplest way to treat plasma would be to boil it.\"\nAnd it worked.\nBoiling the sample destroyed proteins in the plasma -- which could digest, and destroy the DNA -- but the DNA was left unharmed.\nLo tested the mother's blood plasma for fetal DNA, and his first result was staggering.\n\"I could not believe my eyes -- the fetal DNA we had been looking for in the mother's blood was in the part we had not looked in for eight years.\"\nIt had been hiding there all along.\nBringing the discovery to market\nYears passed without Lo's breakthrough finding any real audience or application.\n\"The big prize, the medical world thought, would be if you could use that for testing for Down syndrome,\" Lo remembers.\nDown syndrome is caused by a fetus having an extra copy of chromosome 21. Traditionally, the condition was diagnosed by looking at cells from a fetus and counting the chromosomes.\nScientists didn't believe a diagnosis could be made using cell-free DNA (cfDNA).\nBut Lo proved them wrong.\nAfter another decade of dedication, in 2007, his team showed that due to the extra copy of chromosome 21, the number of molecules produced from this chromosome are increased in the mother's blood plasma if she is carrying a baby with Down syndrome.\n\"People thought we were crazy because that method meant you'd have to do several PCR tests,\" says Lo.\nThe amount of fetal DNA in the plasma, he says, is low, so several amplifications are needed to create enough data to analyze.\nThe expense of this meant that wouldn't be practical. At least not then.\nLuckily for Lo, the introduction of next generation sequencing in 2008 meant millions of DNA fragments could be produced in rapid time.\nIn 2011, Lo launched his non-invasive prenatal blood test for Down syndrome and today, the test is available in more than 90 countries. The last time anyone counted, more than two million pregnant women had been tested.\nRight from the beginning, Lo says he was \"very conscious about the ethical implications.\" When he licensed his technology he did so with a clause firmly in place, prohibiting its use for sex selection. \nA controversial market exists in Hong Kong for prenatal gender testing as blood tests are far more conclusive in the early stages than ultrasounds. The tests cater largely to clients from mainland China where couples have a preference for sons, and where prenatal gender tests are illegal but abortions are not.\nLimitless possibilities\nLo soon discovered that the secrets held by just a few drops of blood are almost limitless.\nPrenatal sequencing of the entire genome could, in the future, screen an unborn baby for various late onset disorders, gene defects -- including the breast cancer gene BRCA1 -- and even predict hair color or longevity.\nAccording to Lo, the prohibitively expensive cost means such tests are not being performed right now.\n\"We've basically created ... a non-invasive window to the body.\"\nSeeking out cancer\nToday, Lo is instead working on a blood test, for adults, that can detect liver, nose and throat cancer at stages so early they would be invisible to conventional screening methods.\nDubbed a \"liquid biopsy,\" it scans the blood plasma for ctDNA released by cancer cells. Lo believes it is possible to identify what type of cancer a patient has, and what stage the disease is at -- all from this DNA.\nSuch a test has already been made available to 10,000 middle-aged men in Hong Kong, and has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of adult lives around the world.\nLo has also used the \"liquid biopsy\" to monitor organ transplant rejection, and even the health of a patient after a car crash. If an organ, or tissue, starts to fail it releases DNA into the blood stream, which can now be picked up using this method.\nRead: Miracle cells could cure blindness\nThe next treasure trove\nLo's next focus is on an even less invasive form of DNA testing -- using a mother's urine.\n\"After a woman delivers a baby, two hours later the fetal DNA is gone from her bloodstream. Where does it go? We thought maybe it was in the urine.\"\nAnd in the urine it was, providing yet another window into both mother and baby -- and their future health.\n\"That, I think, is going to be the next treasure trove.\"", "New U.S. dietary guidelines limit sugar, rethink fat": "The 2015 guidelines recommend a \"healthy eating pattern\" with limited sugar and saturated fat, less salt and more vegetables and whole grains.\nYou might remember the food pyramid poster from your grade school classroom, or the \n\"My Plate\"\n icon from your child's cafeteria. Those earnest posters are a boiled-down version of a complicated food science discussion between \ngovernment-appointed experts\n and all the other players in this food fight, including dietitians, scientists, doctors, medical associations, the food industry and the public. The guidelines are revised every five years, and the draft version of this year's guide came in months ago at more than 500 pages.\nIn the end, there are some breadcrumbs -- whole-wheat, of course -- of advice to follow. The guidance affects everything from what's served in school and prison lunches to how food labels work. It helps dietitians guide their clients. Experts say it also puts pressure on manufacturers and restaurants about what they put in their food.\nHere are nine things you should know about the \n2015 guidelines\n:\n1. Extract that sweet tooth \nFor the first time, the government put a limit on sugar, saying added sugar should make up only 10% of your daily calories. \nThe guidelines are based on Americans eating a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, so 10% of that diet is about 50 grams of sugar. Drinking more than one can of full sugar soda maxes out the limit. This guideline isn't as strict as what the \nAmerican Heart Association suggests\n -- it recommends about half that -- but the limit is significant.\nEating a diet with a lot of sugar increases your risk for heart disease, \nstudies show\n, and can lead to obesity and all the diseases associated with that, including cancer and Type 2 diabetes.\nIf you have a sweet tooth, dietitian \nLisa Drayer\n suggests you budget for it. Look for less-sweet substitutes. Replace full-sugar sodas with seltzer and a splash of cranberry, for instance. Also keep in mind that sugar comes in more than cookies and candy form. Sauces and dressings can trip you up, too. \"I was in the supermarket the other day and picked up a salad dressing that had more sugar than four doughnuts,\" Drayer said. Check the label for sugar that goes by other names like fructose, sucrose, corn syrup or honey. \n2. The Easter bunny is all over this one\nIf you are of a certain age, your doctor might have told you to watch the cholesterol in your diet. At your next appointment, that advice could change.\nPast guidelines suggest a 300-milligram daily limit of dietary cholesterol. That means a two-egg breakfast, rather than three.\nNow, the government has removed the limit on cholesterol. It did add that \"individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible\" because \"foods that are higher in dietary cholesterol, such as fatty meats and high-fat dairy products, are also higher in saturated fats.\" But what that means is eggs are back for \nmost diets\n. \nEgg yolks\n are high in cholesterol, but not high in saturated fat. They make the list of suggested sources of protein.\n\"If you connect the dots together scientifically, we don't believe there is a strong influence between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol,\" Drayer said. \"Even when I was training to be a dietitian, we knew that eating eggs didn't increase your cholesterol as much as saturated fat does. So the government advice is catching up to the science.\"\n3. Something's fishy and bacon hasn't totally left the building\nThe guidelines emphasize eating \nprotein-rich food\n, which helps retain \nmuscle mass\n as we age and \"plays a role in keeping our metabolism running smoothly,\" Drayer said. The new guidelines continue to emphasize eating protein from seafood, lean meat and poultry. There is a specific mention of eating at least 8 ounces of seafood per week. The guidelines single out men and boys for eating too much protein.\nThe summary does not suggest a limit on processed or red meat, as was hinted at in discussions of the draft version of the report, but it does mention there is evidence that a lower intake of meats overall, as well as eating less processed meat and poultry, does reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease. Processed meats like bacon and hot dogs have been \nlinked to an increased cancer risk\n and in 2015, the World Health Organization suggested people avoid them. These guidelines do not. Instead, the guidelines say they \"can be accommodated as long as sodium, saturated fats, added sugars and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating pattern.\"\nThis does not sit well with the American Cancer Society. \"By omitting specific diet recommendations, such as eating less red and processed meat, these guidelines miss a critical and significant opportunity to reduce suffering and death from cancer,\" Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said in a statement released Thursday responding to the new guidelines. \nIf you eat meat, it is suggested for the meat, poultry and eggs subgroup -- eat 26 ounce-equivalents per week based on a U.S.-style and 2,000-calorie diet. It's the same suggestion from the 2010 guidelines.\nIf you are a vegetarian, you have options, too: soy products, beans, lentils and seeds are good protein sources, the guidelines say.\n4. Your mother was right about fruit and veggies\nYour parents were right to tell you to eat your fruits, especially whole fruits, vegetables and grains, at least half of which are whole grains. The guidelines recommend eating 2\u00bd cups of a wide variety of vegetables from all the subgroups of colors and starches a day. A hidden advantage of this suggestion is that it can make you feel full without eating a lot of calories. The suggested two cups of fruit a day, with half coming in the form of whole fruit, provides many essential vitamins and some have high fiber, which helps with digestion. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables helps prevent heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, too. \nThe committee noted in the draft guidance that whole grains are a \n\"shortfall nutrient\"\n in American diets. Brown rice, quinoa, and oats are rich in fiber, calcium and vitamin D and can help with digestion. When eating 6 ounce-equivalents of grains, half of them should be of the whole grain variety. \nStudies show\n that eating cereals can help you live a longer life.\n5. Raise a glass (or a cup) to this\nThe guidelines don't suggest you start drinking, but if you do, not to worry.\nAlcohol consumed in moderation is OK. For women, that means no more than one drink a day. For men, it's two.\nDrinking \na daily glass of wine\n has been associated with a benefit to your heart.\nModerate coffee drinking is also highlighted in the suggested menu. Moderate coffee drinking is defined as drinking three to five cups a day. \nCoffee has been shown to possibly reduce your risk of Type 2 diabetes\n and cardiovascular disease and it may even protect against Parkinson's disease. \n6. Fat is back, kind of \nThe 2010 dietary guidelines allowed for 10% of your calories to come from saturated fat. This time, the guidelines keep the same recommendation, but also expanded upon the concept of \"good\" fat.\nSome fat is \nvital to your health.\n \"Good\" fat includes heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids like the kind found in some fish. Fat from oils, about 5 teaspoons per day, is also OK. \nSaturated fat, or the \"bad\" kind that \ncomes from meat\n, poultry and dairy can raise blood cholesterol, which might increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, weight gain, Type 2 diabetes and cancer.\nTrans fat\n, which the guidelines suggest you consume as little as possible, is harder to find after the Food and Drug Administration told manufacturers to eliminate it from food. Eating trans fat increases unhealthy cholesterol, LDL, and lowers the good kind, HDL.\nFat-free and low-fat dairy found in yogurt, milk and cheese is within the guidelines, but how much you can eat depends on your age.\n7. Eat less salt\nEat less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day. That's about a teaspoon, which is not a lot, especially when many Americans \nget much of their sodium from packaged and processed foods.\nIt's not as restrictive as the American Heart Association's recommendation, which is less than 1,500 milligrams. Too much sodium can make your heart work too hard and lead to \nhigh blood pressure\n.\nIf you're \nlooking for an alternative\n, sprinkle allspice on your food or use other spices like thyme or turmeric.\n8. Eat American, Mediterranean or vegetarian\nThis version of the guidelines is supposed to be more user-friendly. It models three different types of diets at the 2,000-calorie level: the healthy American diet, Mediterranean diet and vegetarian diet.\n\"I think if you want to mix and match and say to yourself, 'Today, I feel like an American-style diet' or you want a vegetarian day or a Mediterranean day, there are ideas on what you should have for each,\" Drayer said. \"It's a little more approachable.\"\n9. Eat what is right for you\nThese are general suggestions on what you should eat to avoid disease and to maintain a healthy weight. As the guidelines said, this is a \"healthy eating pattern\" rather than a \"rigid prescription\" and \"an adaptable framework in which individuals can enjoy foods that meet their personal, cultural, and traditional preferences and fit within their budget.\" If you have a chronic condition or special dietary restrictions, you'll need to see what works best for you.\n\"Of course, keep in mind, half of all Americans have some kind of chronic disease already, so people will need to take a closer look at what works on an individual level,\" Drayer said. \"In other words, talk it over with a health professional and see which parts of this advice you should be listening to.\" \nDr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said the science behind the guidelines is weak and that these are really a best guess. \"They [the guidelines] give broad recommendations and broad ranges.\" he said, calling the science inadequate and calling on the government to conduct well controlled studies that ask the right questions.   \n\"Diet is essential to health ... we are really left with no solid advice for most people,\" he said. ", "Will Smith: Movie 'Concussion' touches raw nerve for NFL": "\"I probably won't be getting my free Super Bowl tickets this year,\" said actor Will Smith, who plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, the man who discovers the link between American football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). \nAs a noted Philadelphia Eagles fan and parent of a former high school football star -- Smith once traveled between China and Los Angeles for 10 straight weeks to watch son Trey compete -- the actor admitted feeling conflicted about the film.\nBut meeting Nigeria-born Omalu convinced him that the story needed to be told. \n\"Dr. Omalu is an immigrant, and a big part of why he fought so hard to have this information come out is because he believes in America and American ideals,\" Smith told CNN's Rachel Nichols ahead of the movie's U.S. release next week.\n\"I believe firmly in the ideas and in the concepts of what this country stands for, and I'm impelled and compelled to do whatever I have to do to make sure they aren't trampled upon.\"\nWhile shooting in Pittsburgh, Smith also met with family members of former NFL players who succumbed to CTE -- including those of former Steeler \"Iron Mike\" Webster.\nThe Hall of Fame center was an anchor on four Super Bowl winning teams before succumbing to substance abuse and homelessness. In 2002 he died at age 50, with pathologist Omalu assigned to his autopsy. \n\"The production was extremely heavy,\" Smith recalled. \"You know, it's not just a movie. It's people's lives that we're trying to do justice to their suffering.\"\nIn the months leading up to the release of \"Concussion,\" leaked Sony emails appeared to express concern among its filmmakers not to upset the NFL, though \ndirector Peter Landesman insisted to the New York Times that the plot line was not altered. \n\"We welcome any conversation about player health and safety,\" said the NFL in a statement sent to CNN. \"Broader and deeper awareness of these issues will positively impact all athletes. \n\"The NFL has made numerous changes to the game to enhance the health and safety of players at all levels of football. These include nearly 40 rule changes in the last decade, strict concussion protocols, and better training and sideline medical care. \n\"We're seeing measurable results, including a 34% decrease in concussions in NFL games since the 2012 season. \n\"Additionally, we are funding independent scientific and medical research and the development of better protective equipment to advance further progress. The game continues to change, and the safety of our players remains our highest priority.\"\nYet the issue of player safety isn't going away anytime soon -- it \nwas recently revealed that 87 of the 91 former NFL players whose brains had been tested for CTE were positively identified by researchers at Boston University and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nOne of the players, former Chicago Bears free safety Dave Duerson, who was known for his aggressive tackles, committed suicide in 2011 and left instructions that his brain be sent to \nBoston University's CTE Center\n.\nResearchers reported that Duerson was correct in his suspicion, though his brash portrayal in the film by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is disputed by his family.  \nFellow Hall of Famer Junior Seau, who committed suicide in 2012, also suffered from CTE. \nCurrently, NFL players are tested for symptoms of concussion by team medical staff alongside independent neurotrauma consultants before they are allowed to return to play. Any player who loses consciousness is barred from returning on that day, a league spokesman confirmed.      \nThe NFL has had a number of run-ins with Hollywood over the years.\nThe 2003 ESPN drama \"Playmakers\"\n lasted just one season before former league commissioner Paul Tagliabue rang ex-Disney head Michael Eisner to complain of the subject matter depicted in the fictional league (drugs, domestic violence, paralysis, homosexuality, to name a few), according to the New York Times.\nTagliabue deemed the show ''one-dimensional and traded in racial stereotypes, and I didn't think that was either appropriate for ESPN or right for our players.\"\nDisney is the parent company of ESPN, which has several broadcasting contracts with the NFL. Eisner decided against greenlighting the series for a second season.\n\"How would (Disney) like it if Minnie Mouse were portrayed as Pablo Escobar and the Magic Kingdom as a drug cartel?\" Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie told the Philadelphia Inquirer, referring to the infamous Colombian drug lord.\nTo a lesser degree, the 1999 Oliver Stone film \"Any Given Sunday\" cast a negative light on the league -- mainly through a corrupt team doctor played by James Woods.\nThough a few former and then-current NFL players appeared in the film (Lawrence Taylor, Terrell Owens), the league did not sanction the use of its logos. \nThe prevalence of head injuries is not just a hot topic in the NFL.  \nDuring the first half of soccer's 2014 World Cup Final, Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer appeared to lose consciousness after his head collided with an Argentina player.\nClearly dazed, Kramer was treated on the pitch before reentering the match only two minutes later, ostensibly without any check for concussed symptoms.  \nIt later emerged that Kramer had asked the referee whether he was playing in the final, before asking to swap shirts with him and attempting to step in as goalkeeper.\n Kramer was finally substituted 14 minutes after returning to the field of play. \nBeginning last season, England's Premier League stipulated that players who suffer head injuries must come off the field and be examined by team doctors. In the past, medically unlicensed members of staff were deemed sufficient.  ", "This is the drug that killed Prince": "The drug, fentanyl, has been around since the 1960s. Its potency works miracles, soothing extreme pain in cancer patients who are usually prescribed patches or lozenges. \nBut an illicit version of the drug is flooding into communities across America, and casual users are finding out that their fentanyl pills and powder are delivering a powerful high that is easy to overdose on. It can even kill. \nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and the Centers for Disease Control say we have another national health crisis on our hands. These are just a handful of the people trying to stop it from taking more lives.\nThe mother\nNatasha Butler stared hard at the pictures laid out in front of her.\nBut she averted her eyes when they lit on the one that still takes her breath away. It's the one that makes what happened real.\nIt's the one where the tubes, needles and respirator are all hooked up to her only son, Jerome, trying to keep him alive. They ultimately didn't.\n\"I'm dying inside,\" she said, her voice falling to a whisper and tears streaming down her face. \"He was my firstborn. I had him when I was 15. We grew up together.\"\nShe had never heard of the substance that killed him. Doctors told her he died from an overdose of fentanyl, which experts say can be 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times stronger than heroin.\n\"He came and told me it was an overdose. I'm like, 'An overdose of what?' It wasn't an overdose. This is murder,\" Butler said. \"I taught my kids two things: God, and don't do drugs.\"\nJerome Butler had not been prescribed the highly controlled narcotic. His mother said she was told that an acquaintance had given Butler what her son thought was a pill of Norco, a less potent opioid-based painkiller, a mix of hydrocodone and acetaminophen. \nThe sellers knew, Butler alleges, that \"the pill had the fentanyl in it, and they killed my son.\"\n \nJerome was one of 10 people who died in just 12 days from fentanyl-laced pills in a sudden spike of deaths in Sacramento County, California, in March. More than 50 people overdosed on those pills in the first three months of the year but survived. Investigators are still looking for the source.\nSimilar clusters of fentanyl-related overdoses and deaths are appearing across the United States.\nLike the DEA\n, the Centers for Disease Control and prevention has issued a health advisory and is stepping in to get health providers and first responders to report fentanyl-related overdoses as well as expand access to naloxone, the drug that counteracts deadly opioid overdoses. \nThe latest state statistics on \nfentanyl-related deaths compiled by the CDC \ntell a sobering story.\nOhio reported 514 fentanyl-related deaths in 2014, up from 93 the year before. Maryland reported 185 fentanyl-related deaths, up from 58 in a year's time. In Florida, the number of deaths jumped to 397 in 2014, from 185. New Hampshire had 151 reported deaths due to fentanyl alone in 2015, five times the number of deaths from heroin, according to the office of the state's chief medical examiner.\nNo one was more stunned to see those numbers than the mother freshly grieving her son's death from the drug. She didn't know that so many other families had suffered its deadly effects long before it hit hers until she started researching it.  \n\"What are we doing? What are we doing about it?\" Butler said, exasperated and weeping. \"I'm willing to do everything that I can.\"\nAnd that is just what Butler intends to do. She's on a mission to warn communities about the opioid-based drugs killing people at alarming rates across America.\nShe is talking to community groups and has called senators, the California governor, even the White House, looking to tell her story and to build a coalition to help stave off more deaths from opioid use, especially fentanyl.\n\"I'm mad at the person who sold it. I'm mad at the person who is compressing it. I'm mad at the state for not protecting our people,\" she said. \nSince her son's death, she said, she's heard from so many young people who are addicted to painkillers such as Norco.\n\"If you feel you don't have that much strength, let's get together,\" she said. \"We can build strength. We can make a difference. We have to.\"\nThe special agent\nIllicit fentanyl is a bestseller on the streets and a prolific killer. It is so potent that when law enforcement goes in to seize it, officers have to wear level A hazmat suits, the highest protection level made, the same kind of suits health care workers use to avoid contamination by the deadly Ebola virus. \n\"Just micrograms can make a difference between life and death. It's that serious,\" said DEA Special Agent John Martin, who is based in San Francisco. An amount the size of a few grains of sand of fentanyl can kill you. \"All you have to do is touch it. It can be absorbed through the skin and the eyes.\"\nOne of the top priorities for Martin and his agency is to stop the flow of fentanyl and other opioids from flooding American communities. \nIt first showed up in deadly doses on the streets in 2007. The DEA traced the illicit fentanyl to a single lab in Mexico and shut it down. Fentanyl drug seizures subsided for a while, but in 2014, they spiked in 10 states.\nIt's been an uphill battle. Americans are buying it in record numbers, and highly organized drug cartels are spreading it far and wide.\nWhat is curious is where the drug or elements to make it originate. Its street nickname is \"China White\" or \"China girl,\" offering a hint at where most of it is coming from. \n\"DEA investigations reveal that Mexico-based drug cartels are buying fentanyl directly from China,\" Martin said.\nAnd as far as profits go, the other opioids commonly sold on the streets -- heroin, hydrocodone, OxyContin and Norco -- can't even touch fentanyl.\nHydrocodone sells for about $30 a pill on the street. A fentanyl pill may look and cost the same but requires only a fraction of the narcotic to give users an even stronger reaction.\nThe DEA estimates that drug traffickers can buy a kilogram of fentanyl powder for $3,300 and sell it on the streets for more than 300 times that, generating nearly a million dollars. \nFentanyl is often trafficked through the cartels' standard maze of routes through Mexico and into the U.S. But sometimes it's simply ordered on the notorious dark web and shows up straight from China in the buyer's mailbox.\n\"We're using countless resources to deal with the threat,\" Martin said.\nSeizures of the drug have jumped dramatically, which would seem to be good news for the DEA. But what it indicates is that there is more of it to seize than ever before.\n\"Everywhere from the Northeast corridor, down to New York, the Midwest and now we're seeing it here out on the West Coast. Fentanyl is everywhere right now,\" Martin said.\nOn the East Coast and in the Midwest, it's often sold as powder and mixed with heroin. On the West Coast, it is showing up mostly in pill form.\n\"It's feeding America's addiction to opioids,\" Martin said, adding that the cartels have figured out a way to make it more cheaply and easily than heroin.\nThe forensic scientist\n\"They look like what you're getting from the pharmacy,\" forensic scientist Terry Baisz said. She was taken aback by just how much the counterfeit pills look like the ones sold by pharmaceutical companies. \nAfter 26 years in the Orange County crime lab, south of Los Angeles, she has never seen anything like what is coming in these days. It worries her.\n\"I was shocked the first time I tested this stuff and it came back as fentanyl. We hadn't seen it before 2015,\" Baisz said, \"and now we're seeing it a lot.\" \nFentanyl had entered Orange County, and it was killing people.\nWearing gloves and a lab coat, Baisz looked down at a tiny clear plastic bag under a glass hood with a ventilation system. It was pure fentanyl. A sneeze or deep breath could end in a deadly overdose, so testing it calls for strict protocols. But Baisz said it's the pills that worry her the most as a public threat.\n\"I wouldn't hold those in a sweaty palm for long. You're bound to get dosed,\" she said. \nIn her lab coat and gloves, she pointed to pills spread across a table. They were all labeled as various well-known pharmaceutical drugs. They looked like perfect replicas of the real deal. None was labeled as fentanyl, but that is what most of them actually were.\n\"Just one could kill you,\" Baisz said. \"We have to test them. We can no longer rely on the database and our naked eye.\"\nThe lawmaker\n\"It's so dangerous and so lethal, I had to get involved,\" California state Sen. Patricia Bates said. \"Two minutes, and you could be in respiratory arrest and be dead. It's kind of like, get high and die.\"\nBates knows those details because the fentanyl overdose deaths started racking up in one of the areas she represents, South Orange County. She is trying to push through a bill that would put harsher penalties on high-volume sellers of fentanyl.\nThe bill \"will enhance the penalties, by weight,\" Bates said. \"We're talking about ... catching the big guys, because when you take them out of the food chain, you really do reduce the incidents of the trafficking and what's available on the streets.\"\nShe knows it's a tough sell in a time when California voters have passed laws to lessen prison sentences for nonviolent offenders. And, of course, there is the matter of prison overcrowding in the state. But Bates is pushing it forward because she is certain this is the next epidemic, similar to what is happening with heroin but more deadly.\n\"Addicts are migrating to fentanyl,\" she said, \"They are driven to it because it's a quicker, bigger high. Yet it is something that you don't recover from when you get that super-high.\"\nThe drug counselor\nWhen fentanyl began showing up in San Francisco in 2015, Eliza Wheeler helped get the word out on the streets about a new, very potent drug in town. \nIn San Francisco, the drug showed up in the form of white powder and then as pills labeled as Xanax. It turned out to be pure fentanyl. A health advisory warned that more than 75 people had experienced an overdose in July that year.\n\"People didn't know what it was,\" Wheeler said. They thought it was heroin, which is far less potent. \nThough San Francisco has seen a sudden rise in fentanyl overdoses, the city did not experience the large number of deadly overdoses that other cities have.\nWheeler is a project manager at the DOPE Project (\nDrug Overdose Prevention and Education\n) in San Francisco. In cooperation with the city's health department, DOPE and other organizations flooded the streets with fliers \nwarning that \"white heroin,\"\n promising a super high, was super potent and potentially deadly. The fliers also advised drug users to carry around Narcan, the brand name for naloxone, which blocks or reverses the effects of opioid-based drugs. It is supposed to be used in an emergency such as an overdose. \nSince 2003, DOPE has trained about 6,000 people on how and when to use Narcan. It can be administered with a needle or as a nasal spray. \"We saved countless people by giving easier access to (Narcan) and informing them about the dangers right away,\" Wheeler said. \nThe San Francisco Department of Public Health sent out a health advisory crediting groups like DOPE with saving lives.   \n\"If you want to do something that will keep people from dying and impact the crisis immediately, then lawmakers should help make more naloxone and training available to the public,\" Wheeler said.\nNatasha Butler, who continues to grieve her only son, would like to see something else, too. \n\"We have an Amber alert to save children. Why not have a Jerome alert to warn people about this drug?\"\nDo you have a personal story to tell? Please share", "Did humans kill off Neanderthals?": "\"Humans migrating out of Africa would have been a significant reservoir of tropical diseases,\" said lead author, Charlotte Houldcroft from the University of Cambridge's Division of Biological Anthropology, in a statement. \"For the Neanderthal population of Eurasia, adapted to that geographical environment, exposure to new pathogens carried out of Africa may have been catastrophic.\"\nResearchers at Cambridge and Oxford Brookes universities analyzed DNA from ancient bones and pathogen genomes. They concluded that some infectious diseases are probably thousands of years older than previously believed. \nThere is evidence that humans caught viruses from other hominins before moving out of Africa. There is even evidence that our human ancestors \nmated with Neanderthals\n thousands of years ago and exchanged disease-related genes. So researchers argue that it's safe to say humans could have passed diseases on to Neanderthals when they moved into Europe. \n\"As we now know that humans bred with Neanderthals, and we all carry 2% to 5% of Neanderthal DNA as a result, it makes sense to assume that, along with bodily fluids, humans and Neanderthals transferred diseases,\" said Houldcroft. \nInfections likely to have been passed from humans to Neanderthals include tapeworm, tuberculosis, stomach ulcers and types of herpes, according to the study. \nThe researchers suggest that herpes simplex 2, which is the virus that causes genital herpes, was passed to humans in Africa about 1.6 million years ago. Helicobacter pylori, a strain of bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, likely infected humans for the first time in Africa at least 88,000 years ago and first arrived in Europe about 52,000 years ago. But recent evidence suggests that Neanderthals became extinct about 40,000 years ago, supporting this new theory that modern humans are responsible for killing off Neanderthals. \nInfectious diseases were previously thought to have spread quickly when agriculture developed about 8,000 years ago and humans began living in larger groups surrounded by animals. But new research argues that diseases existed much earlier than previously thought.\n\"Once agriculture came along, these diseases had the perfect conditions to explode, but they were already around,\" said Houldcroft. \nResearchers say that the infections would not have all happened at once, as they did when Christopher Columbus and other Europeans arrived in the Americas and eradicated indigenous populations. Instead, they would have spread between small groups of about 15 to 30, weakening them and making it nearly impossible to survive. \nMany theories exist to explain the demise of the Neanderthal population, including climate change, human cognitive superiority, competition for food due to humans hunting with dogs and wolves, and direct competition and violence between humans and Neanderthals, said Houldcroft.\nShe believes that the extinction is probably due to a combination of factors.\n\"Infectious diseases exchanged between humans and Neanderthals are likely to have been just one of many factors making it harder for Neanderthals to survive in Europe alongside modern humans,\" said Houldcroft. \"I don't think any single factor was solely responsible, and we may never know which theory is correct, although we can continue to look for more evidence and try to test different theories.\"", "Coffee could literally be a lifesaver": "Researchers started with data from surveys of adults in the United States that asked how much coffee they consumed, as well as other foods and drinks, and then they looked at their rates of death and disease over the following two decades. \nThe study was large, including more than 200,000 women and 50,000 men. \nAt first, researchers did not see an obvious relationship between coffee consumption and death rates. Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.\nBut when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers. Those who drank three to five cups and more than five cups had 15% and 12% lower death rates.\n\"The lower risk of mortality is consistent with our hypothesis that coffee consumption could be good for you (because) we have published papers showing that coffee consumption is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and (heart) disease,\" said Ming Ding, a doctoral student in the Harvard School of Public Health department of nutrition. Ding is the lead author of the study, which was published on Monday in the journal Circulation. \nIt might have been hard to see the link between coffee consumption and lower death rates because coffee and smoking often go hand-in-hand, and any benefits associated with the first could have been canceled out by the second. Although the study participants were asked about smoking, there might have been a tendency, especially among heavy smokers, to underestimate the average number of cigarettes they smoked per day, Ding said.\nWhat's behind the lower death rate? \nIt's possible that people who drink a lot of java have healthier diets overall and drink less soda,  which has been linked to higher rates of death and heart disease, or that they have healthier diets overall. \nBut that's probably not what links coffee to lower death rates -- researchers took into account the health benefits of drinking less soda and eating well. They also took into account the fact that coffee drinkers were more likely to have vices such as drinking alcohol and eating red meat.\nAt least some of the health benefits associated with coffee consumption are probably a direct result of the ingredients in coffee, Ding said. It contains chemicals such as lignans and chlorogenic acid that could reduce inflammation and help control blood sugar, both of which could help reduce the risk of heart disease. \nIn keeping with this possibility, Ding and her colleagues found that coffee drinkers were about 10% less likely to die of heart disease. They were also between 9% and 37% less likely to die of neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and dementia. \nThe researchers also found that study participants who drank at least a cup of coffee a day had between 20% and 36% lower rates of suicide, although those who drank less than a cup had 36% higher rates.\nSeveral other studies have hinted at an association between coffee consumption and lower suicide rates, but it was a bit unexpected to see, Ding said. It is not clear whether chemicals in coffee have a direct effect on mental health or whether people who drink a lot of coffee have higher rates of employment or certain lifestyles that are associated with lower suicide rates, she added.\nAlthough previous studies have suggested that drinking coffee could protect against cancers such as prostate and liver, the current study did not find lower rates of cancer deaths among java drinkers. \nHowever, there may not have been a large enough number of deaths because of specific cancers, such as liver cancer, to be able to see a difference between coffee drinkers and nondrinkers, Ding said. ", "What you need to know about fentanyl": "According to the latest numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5,500 people died of synthetic opioid overdoses in 2014, most of them related to fentanyl. That's an 80% increase over the numbers reported in 2013. \nLast year, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a \nnational alert\n stating that \"drug incidents and overdoses related to fentanyl are occurring at an alarming rate.\" In 2013, the DEA made 942 fentanyl seizures; in 2014, it made 3,344. \nStreet version vs. hospital version\nUsed by doctors, fentanyl is the most powerful opioid in medicine. However, according to the DEA, much of what is being found on the streets is not diverted from hospitals but rather \nsourced\n from China and Mexico. Frequently, people buy it on the street with no idea that it is fentanyl. \nThis year in \nCalifornia\n (PDF), fentanyl was passed off as the prescription drug Norco and sold on the streets. In just one 10-day period, this batch was responsible for at least 10 deaths and 48 overdoses. \nDealers are also cutting heroin with fentanyl to give the heroin a bigger kick. \nBeyond fentanyl itself, law enforcement is also concerned with its analogues: designer drugs with similar function but slightly different chemical structure. \nJust a little bit can be lethal\nThe danger of fentanyl isn't just to users. It can be a threat to anyone who comes into contact with it. The drug can be absorbed through the skin or accidentally inhaled. In 2015, a\n New Jersey police officer\n had shortness of breath, dizziness and slowed breathing after coming into contact with fentanyl.\nIt is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin. Just a quarter of a milligram -- 0.25 milligrams -- can kill you. \nFor a sense of just how little that is, a typical baby aspirin tablet is 81 mg. If you cut that tablet into 324 pieces, one of those pieces would be equal to a quarter-milligram. \nWhat does it look like?\nFentnayl can come in several forms. Used in the hospital, it can be injected, put in a patch for absorption into the body or given as a lozenge or a lollipop. \n Illegal forms\n include a powder, a pill or a piece of blotter paper placed under the tongue. \nWho is using and where?\nMore than 80% of all fentanyl seizures in 2014 were concentrated in just \n10 states\n: Ohio, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Kentucky, Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire and Indiana.\nIn 2013, Ohio reported 92 fentanyl-related overdose deaths. The next year, there was a five-fold increase, with 514 deaths. In Maryland, the number of overdose deaths jumped from 58 in 2013 to 185 the next year.\nThough heroin used to be concentrated in low-income urban areas, \nopioid drug users now\n are predominantly white, suburban and in their late 20s. \nDoes naloxone work on fentanyl?\nThe drug naloxone can reverse an opioid overdose. However, because fentanyl is so potent, it may require \nseveral doses\n of naloxone to bring someone out of a fentanyl overdose. That is why it is of particular concern when people don't know whether they are even using fentanyl have an overdose. Those around them may not know they need to administer more naloxone to bring them out of it. ", "5,000-year-old brewery discovered in China": "Archeologists from Stanford University unearthed what they think is an ancient brewery at the Mijiaya site in China's Shaanxi province. Their findings were published in \nthe latest edition of PNAS. \nThe team found two subterranean pits with beer-making equipment that included funnels, pots and amphorae holding the residue of what probably was 5,000-year-old beer.\n\"The shapes and styles of the vessels show stylistic similarities to the brewing equipment in the historical period and modern ethnographic records,\" said study co-author Jiajing Wang.\nThe archeologists believe the pits would have acted like an ancient cooler, helping in the beer-making process and with storage. \nA pottery stove found in each pit may have been used to keep the ingredients at the optimal temperature for mashing, a technique similar to what you would see in beer-making today. \nTests of the yellow residue show the presence of barley, broomcorn millet, tubers and Job's tears (also known as Chinese pearl barley or coix seed), which were fermented together to make what probably would have been a sweet and sour kind of brew.\n\"This beer recipe indicates a mix of Chinese and Western traditions: barley from the West, millet, Job's tears, tubers from China,\" Wang said.\nThe experts suggest, though, that you shouldn't run right out to try that recipe in your home operation, as the ancients may have included other ingredients in their concoctions that were lost to time.\nBarley was the big surprise, as it has never been detected in archaeological materials from China that were this old. \nThe authors argue that barley was probably introduced into the area for beer making. They don't believe people were using it for food until much later, although more research is needed to prove that theory. \nEarlier research has shown that beer has long been a part of Chinese culture. It gets a mention in the written record in the late Shang dynasty (circa 1250-1046 B.C.). \nA short, intoxicating history of beer\nAncient humans' love of beer has also been known for decades. Some archeologists argue that it was that love, and not an interest in breakfast or bread, that led to the domestication of cereals around 9500-8000 B.C. Up to 40% of the annual cereal crop in Mesopotamia may have gone to the production of beer. \nArcheologists have found evidence of 11,000-year-old brewing troughs at Gobekli Tepe in Turkey. \nBeer was also the national drink in Mesopotamia and Egypt, according to research from \nXavier University theologist Michael Homan\n. You could get paid in beer or pay for your bride with it. It was used as medicine and as a cosmetic. \nThere are ancient gods dedicated to beer, like the Sumerian goddess Ninkasi, who has her own drinking hymn. Temples kept their own brewers on the payroll. \nEven the modern God (i.e. Yahweh), was believed to have a sizable drinking habit. The ancients were encouraged to offer it as a daily libation \nas is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, Numbers 28: 7-10.  \nThe benefits of beer\nBeer in the ancient world was used much like it is now, as a kind of social lubricant. (\"Hey, handsome ancient Sumarian stonecutter, let me buy you a beer. You come here often?\"). Beer has also been found in \npaintings at ancient brothels\n. \nBut it also served in a more important everyday role: Beer was a much safer alternative to drinking water in the pre-Brita-filter era. The alcohol killed many of the microorganisms you'd find in your local watering hole. \nIn this study, the authors suggest that beer drinking, often a habit we associate more with frat parties than with sophisticated f\u00eates, may have actually spawned a social complexity not seen in Chinese culture previously. \nPublic buildings from that time period suggest a kind of hierarchy in the culture. It may have had an elite class that engaged in a kind of competitive feasting and drinking. \nBeer, the researchers argue, \"may have contributed to the emergence of hierarchical societies.\" In other words, it may have been one of the driving forces behind the development of sophisticated cultures in an area known as the cradle of Chinese civilization.\nThe development of beer bellies, however, is probably a more modern phenomenon. ", "Doctors must lead us out of our opioid abuse epidemic": "Additionally, an opiate abuser is characteristically \"nodding out\" and often scratching their itchy skin. While their face is becoming pale and clammy, their fingernails and lips are starting to turn blue or even a sickly purplish-black. When the choking noises -- or the deep snore gurgling sounds, known as the death rattle -- begins, it's time to act -- and fast. That is a pretty clear sign the opiates have just turned off the person's drive to breathe and they are in the throes of an overdose.\nIt is an awful sight, and yet someone in this country dies like this \nevery 19 minutes\n. There is no other medication routinely used for a nonfatal condition that kills patients so frequently. The majority of those deaths result from prescription opioid medications, such as hydrocodone, OxyContin and Percocet. \nIt is so common that specialists even have a profile for the most typical victim: non-Hispanic Caucasian male, mid 30s. Initial diagnosis: back pain due to trauma, surgery or degenerative arthritis. And, most remarkably, average time from first prescription to time of overdose death: just 31 months. \nThis is a public health epidemic and one that is uniquely American. No other country in the world has the perverse amount of consumption as we do in the United States. And nowhere do we pay the price as dearly as with prescription opioid medications. \nAs of 2011, 75% of the world's opioid prescription drugs are prescribed and swallowed up in a country that makes up less than 5% of the world's population, leading to the most common cause of unintentional death in America today -- drug overdoses.  It is a horrifying and shameful statistic.\nAnd, having traveled all over the world covering natural disaster, wars and famine, I am fully confident we Americans don't have 75% of the world's pain.\nWho is at fault?\nThere is plenty of blame to go around. Drugs are cheaper than a multidisciplinary approach to treating pain, and cost savings are what insurance companies like to hear. \nFor decades, certain pharmaceutical companies misled the FDA about the risks of opioid dependence in an effort to sell more of the drugs, and three top executives from Purdue Pharma even pleaded guilty to those criminal charges. \nOur federal government has created nearly insurmountable hurdles to studying other therapies such as medicinal marijuana, which has for years been used safely and effectively in other countries for chronic neuropathic pain, one of the most difficult types to treat.\nMost of the blame, however, belongs on the shoulders of the American doctors themselves. I am a practicing neurosurgeon, and this is not an easy thing to acknowledge. The fact is, we have accepted the tall tales and Pollyannaish promises of what these medications could do for too long. As a community, we weren't skeptical enough. We didn't ask enough questions. We accepted flimsy scientific data as gospel and preached it to our patients in a chamber that echoed loudly for decades. \nEven worse, too many doctors who didn't actually believe the hyperbole surrounding opioids doled out long-term prescriptions regardless, in the same way doctors write antibiotic prescriptions for viral illnesses. In both cases, they don't work. In both cases, they can cause colossal harm. \nThe King of Pain\nIt was a particular  American doctor who, in many ways, started all of this. If you want to identify a specific moment this opioid epidemic sprouted wings, many would point to \na paper written 30 years ago\n this month. \nBased on a study of just 38 patients in 1986, Dr. Russell Portenoy challenged the conventional wisdom. Up until that time, opioids had been reserved for cancer patients and palliative care and only for short durations because of the \nconcern about addiction\n. Dr. Portenoy, armed with his small study, believed prescription opioids could safely be used in all patients with chronic pain for years on end. He maintained that the drugs were easy to quit and that overdoses hardly ever occurred. \nAlong with several others, Portenoy cited a \nsingle-paragraph letter\n to the editor from the New England Journal of Medicine stating that less than 1% of opioid users would become physically dependent or addicted. \nAs it turns out, almost none of this was true. \nWhen we reached recently retired Dr. Hershel Jick, author of the oft-quoted \"1% letter,\" he was quick to point out that his statistic was misrepresented. It was intended to represent only patients prescribed opioids in the hospital who were carefully monitored. He told us he never anticipated the remarkable impact a one-paragraph letter would have in the decades to follow. \nEven Portenoy, once mockingly referred to as the King of Pain, appears to have \nrecanted and apologized\n for his part in walking the American people into an abyss of addiction. \nThere is no question that many people suffer unimaginable chronic pain, and we don't want to solve the epidemic by impeding their ability to obtain pain relief. But the truth is, they deserve medications better suited for the job. They deserve medications that uncouple powerful analgesia from terrible addictive potential. They deserve medications that don't cause hyperalgesia, a syndrome of increased pain necessitating escalating doses of opioids. Most of all, they deserve to have doctors who rely on scientific evidence that is solid, not fanciful.\nWhere we stand\nWe have a long way to go.  Instead of safer pain therapeutics, patients are now being offered expensive new medications that only treat the consequences of the opioid epidemic. With 259 million opioid prescriptions being written yearly, it turns out side effects -- such as constipation -- are a big enough business to warrant its own \nSuper Bowl commercial\n. \nThere are other grim signs. We now know that heroin has made a resurgence and 80% of new heroin users start off using pain pills, which contain the same type of base ingredients.\nMost disturbing, however, is a recent study showing\n that 91% of people who survived an overdose\n were still able to get another opioid prescription, typically from the same prescribing doctor. Not only are we failing to learn and make progress, it seems we are turning a blind eye to the tragedies unfolding right in front of us.\nA doctor call to action\nAs policymakers begin to catch on, rules and regulations will start to change. As part of a discussion I moderated with President Obama last month, we learned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now recommending against doctors prescribing opioids for most chronic pain situations. When a prescription is written, it should be for the lowest effective dose and the shortest amount of time: usually just a few days. \nPills will also come with safeguards to make them difficult to abuse and discourage \"doctor-shopping,\" as well as a strong warnings about addiction -- something we doctors should have been diligent about all along.\nBut most simply, we as doctors need to engage our patients and discuss treatment with them, whether its short term opioids or alternatives like physical and occupational therapy. We need to help set realistic expectations for our patients: Living entirely pain free is not always possible. As doctors, we need to have follow-up conversations with our patients to see how treatment is going. If we better understand our patients, we can provide better treatment and help develop pain strategies that are effective and safe. \nIt is not too late. In order for this American-made epidemic to finally end, however, it is the American doctors who must lead the way.", "Why are my hands always cold?": "Growing up in sunny Southern California, this rarely happened\u2014mostly just on ski trips or when I'd spend too long in the ocean. (Yes, I realize how obnoxious that sentence is.) But when I moved to New York for college five years ago, my blue hands became a winter mainstay. I'd never lived in a cold climate, so I assumed this happened to everyone in frigid weather.\nTurns out I assumed wrong. On a trip to Chicago to visit extended family this past Thanksgiving, I went for a walk and returned to my aunt's house with my signature blue fingers. \"Oh, you must have Raynaud's,\" my aunt said. I must have what?\nNaturally, I headed back to New York with a lot of questions, so I called up Melisa Lai Becker, MD, site chief of emergency medicine at Cambridge Health Alliance in Everett, Mass. Dr. Lai Becker described my experience as \"the classic vignette that would open a textbook chapter on Raynaud's disease.\" (By the way, it's pronounced ray-NOHZ.) So if you're concerned you might also have Raynaud's, here's some info and advice from Dr. Lai Becker to help you (and me) out.\nRELATED: Why Your Hands and Feet Are Always Cold and What to Do About It\nHow do I know I have it?\n\"The average person can go into chilly weather and get by without gloves, their fingers would just get a bit cold,\" says Dr. Lai Becker. But someone who has Raynaud's has a much more extreme reaction. \"If you touch their hands, you can tell the difference,\" she explains. \"Even in a moderately cold environment, they have white, ice-cold hands.\" In addition to getting cold, if you have Raynaud's, your hands might turn white, then blue, and red when you start warming up again. But not everyone with Raynaud's exhibits all three colors, or in that exact order. You might also experience these symptoms in other extremities including your ears, nose, lips, and even nipples (cringe!).\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, even simply getting cold and painful fingers, Dr. Lai-Becker recommends you see your doctor and possibly get a referral to a rheumatologist. A doctor will help you determine whether you have primary Raynaud's (the most common type), or secondary, meaning it's brought on by another condition.\nHow did I get this?\nFor primary Raynaud's, genetics likely play a role. According to Mayo Clinic, about one-third of people with primary Raynaud's (the most common type) have an immediate relative with the disorder. Although anyone can develop the disease, Raynaud's is \"overwhelmingly more common with women and generally first discovered in adolescence,\" explains Dr. Lai Becker.\nBut for cases of secondary Raynaud's (also called Raynaud's phenomenon), the NIH says there's usually an underlying cause such as nerve damage, injuries to hands and feet, exposure to certain chemicals, repetitive stress (like typing or playing the piano), medicines that affect blood pressure, or nicotine. Secondary Raynaud's is less common, and doesn't usually appear in adults until after age 40. However, since it tends to be a more serious condition, it's important to see your doctor if you notice symptoms of the disease later in life.\nRELATED: 20 Habits That Make You Miserable Every Winter\nWhy do my hands turn blue?\nWhy the heck do you turn into a blueberry when it's cold? \"No one's been able to say for sure what causes it,\" says Dr. Lai Becker. \"But we know one thing: cold can trigger the closing up of blood vessels.\" If you have Raynaud's, the arteries to your fingers and toes go into vasospasm\u2014which means your blood vessels narrow and limit blood supply to affected areas, explains Dr. Lai Becker. Chilly temperatures generally trigger this phenomenon, whether that's in the form of cold air or icy water. However, according to Dr. Lai Becker, doctors have also found an attack can be caused by emotional stress or hormonal changes.\nIs it dangerous?\nFor the most part, Raynaud's isn't a huge concern, says Dr. Lai Becker, but it does increase your risk for frostbite. \"Another thing that could happen is spasms,\" she explains. \"You have these tiny little blood vessels in your fingertips, and if they start to spasm, that makes it difficult for blood to get to your extremities.\" This could result in sores or dead tissue. It's also possible that blood circulation to your fingers and toes could stop entirely, leaving deformities. But don't freak out\u2014these conditions are extremely rare. But if for some reason they do occur, it's important to seek treatment from your doctor immediately.\nRELATED: 10 Winter Health Myths, Busted\nCan I treat it?\nThere are plenty of treatment options available, depending on the cause and severity of your Raynaud's. \"If it happens to be the primary problem, it's not that big of a deal,\" says Dr. Lai Becker. \"It's very manageable and there's certainly medications you can take.\" You can try anything from medications that widen blood vessels to nerve surgery to Botox injections. But for the most part, Raynaud's is manageable without extreme treatment. \"The best way to cope with it is to avoid a trigger, which is generally a change to cold weather,\" says Dr. Lai Becker. \"Plus, getting yourself a really good pair of gloves is essential!\"\nSince I don't have plans to move back to sunny California in the near future, here are the next two things on my to-do list: schedule an appointment with my doctor, and invest in a hefty pair of mittens. Who's with me? \nThis article originally appeared on \nHealth.com\n.", "'I'm not the Obamacare kid anymore'": "This is the challenge facing Marcelas Owens, who just turned 17. For much of life, people have only known Marcelas as the \"Obamacare kid.\"\nHe was the chubby 11-year-old African-American boy who stood next to President Barack Obama as he signed Obamacare into law at a White House ceremony on March 23, 2010.  He was the miniature health care activist in the black vest dwarfed by powerful lawmakers in a famous photo of that moment. He was a modern-day Peter Pan, perpetually frozen in childhood even as the news cycle moved on.\nBut so has Marcelas. As supporters prepare to mark the sixth anniversary of Obamacare's signing, Marcelas is marking another rite of passage -- as a transgender teen. After years of questions, she is starting to tell family and friends what she has long known: Though born male, she's long identified as a female. \n\"I'm going through a reinvention process,\" she says. \"I'm growing into adulthood. I'm not the Obamacare kid anymore.\"\nWill they still like me?\nMarcelas doesn't look like a kid anymore. The chipmunk cheeks are gone. So is the baby fat. And the voice is deepened. She's a teenager now. She listens to hip-hop artist Drake and Michael Jackson. Hangs out at the mall with friends. Even writes songs to express what she struggles to say to others in conversations.\nEach March, Marcelas goes through a ritual. She gets calls from the media to talk about her front row seat at a historic moment. She's proud of her role in Obamacare. And she understands why people would be curious about that kid in the White House picture.\n\"If I wasn't me, I would like to know, where did he go?\" Marcelas says.\nShe wonders, though, how people will react to her answer. Will they still like her now or do they prefer the kid in the photograph?\nShe calls that kid the old Marcelas, understands the world saw her as a boy and is OK with using male pronouns for that period of her life.\n\"I like it that I can be called the Obamacare kid, but in some ways I wish I could look past the Obamacare kid and become Marcelas and people would have the same reaction to me that they had with the Obamacare kid.\"\nMarcelas lives in a townhome in Seattle with two younger sisters, Myanna, 12, and Monique, 13, and their grandmother, Gina Owens. On March 10, Marcelas celebrated her 17th birthday with her family by eating beef tacos with cheese and a birthday cake topped with white frosting.\nThe first person she told about being transgender was her grandmother, who took over raising the three siblings after their mother, Tiffany, died at 27 from pulmonary hypertension. \nTransgender people identify with a gender different from the sex assigned on their birth certificate.\n \nOwens shared her reaction to Marcelas' announcement in a Facebook post last week. It was addressed to \"My first born grandchild.\" \nOwens wrote:\n\"On this day [March 10] you were born to the world as your mother's 1st child. You are 17 now, and have in so, so many ways, made your mom & me very proud. We both have watched you grow & become the person you are today.\n\"So today, on your 17th birthday; I tell you AND the world; My grandson is on a new journey in life... I am so happy that SHE has trusted our relationship enough where SHE felt more comfortable sharing with me first; BEFORE the rest of the world... I give my heart & blessing to HER. I LOVE YOU AND YOUR COURAGE IN LIFE, MORE THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. Walk your journey in love & light.\" \nOwens says, though, that it wasn't easy at first to hear the news from Marcelas.\n\"I didn't like the idea,\" she says. \"For me he was born into the world as Marcelas Owens, the boy his mom created. That's how I wish he would stay. But I also told Marcelas that he's always had the ability to think through things himself. And he's always had the foresight to talk to me.\"\nMarcelas may have some difficult days ahead, but she's had them before. The world may only know Marcelas as the cute kid who stood next to Obama, but few know about the pain Marcelas had to endure to get there. \n'You can't let anybody die like my mom did'\nThe year is 2007. Marcelas is on the verge of tears. He is just 7. He is at a Seattle hospital with his grandmother and his sisters when he hears the news. His mother has died.\nMarcelas' grandmother reaches out and gives him a hug.\n\"It's time to go home, Marcelas,\" she says.\n\"We don't have a home anymore,\" Marcelas says, his eyes welling. \"Momma's gone.\"\nMarcelas was too young to understand that his grandmother would now be his caretaker. His father was never part of his life, according to his grandmother.\n\"When my mother passed away, I really thought me and my sisters were going to have to live on our own. I thought I was going to have to start getting a job and start to pay bills,\" Marcelas says now.\nMarcelas' mother died because she didn't have health insurance, Owens says. She was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension in 2006. Her illness caused her to miss days at work, which led to her losing her job. She was denied Medicaid because she had earned too much money working the previous year.\nMarcelas' loss led to him becoming a child activist in one of the most vicious political fights in American history. He comes from a family of activists, though. His mother and grandmother were volunteers in the Washington Community Action Network, a Seattle group formed to fight for economic and social justice. Washington CAN!, as it's known, became involved in the fight for Obamacare.\nAnd so did Marcelas' family. He would attend Obamacare rallies staged by Washington CAN! with his mother and grandmother. After his mother died, he started sharing his hurt and anger at events. Organizers saw a natural spokesman, a vulnerable kid who could give a human face to an abstract political issue.\nMarcelas stepped into a new role. While other kids his age could barely mumble while speaking before a class, he was speaking to crowds of up to 6,000 people at rallies. At one rally in Seattle, he met U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from the state of Washington. Murray later told a Huffington Post reporter about that meeting.\n\"I went to that rally and, after I spoke, I turned around and there was this little boy looking right straight up at me with his big brown eyes,\" she said. \"And he said to me, 'You can't let anybody die like my mom did.' \"\nMarcelas made a powerful friend in Washington. And when the Affordable Care Act was passed, he was invited to the White House signing ceremony. He still talks about the experience with a sense of awe.\nIt was a blur. The memories from that day are now just fragments: rushing to Nordstrom with his family to buy a vest and tie that he could wear to the ceremony; having a nightmare the night before that he might do something embarrassing; being struck by how small the White House looked from inside.\nHe couldn't believe that a kid from Seattle was helping make history.\n\"The whole thing felt like a dream,\" Marcelas says. \"It all went fast. I was doubting myself. How did I do this?\"\nAnd then he saw Obama. \nThe President was talking to some lawmakers when he saw Marcelas, stopped and walked over with an outstretched hand. Marcelas noticed that he just happened to be wearing the same color tie as Obama.\n\"Oh, you're Marcelas,\" Obama said, shaking his hand.\nMarcelas doesn't remember what he said in response, only what he felt.\n\"I was scared I was going to say something to embarrass myself.\"\nThen came the signing ceremony. All the lawmakers angling for a place in front of the cameras bolted in front of him; all Marcelas could see were their backs. Then he heard someone tell a grinning man to move and make way for the kid. It was Sen. Harry Reid from Nevada telling Vice President Joe Biden to make way for Marcelas.\nAs Biden moved behind him, Marcelas says, the vice president told him to count the number of pens Obama used as they passed by. After Obama signed the bill, the President turned to Marcelas and said, \"I'm proud of you.\"\nThen he gave Marcelas a parting gift.\n\"I got a high five and fist bump from Barack Obama,\" Marcelas says.\nWhen he returned home, he slowly realized that he had become a mini-celebrity. Someone in Africa sent his family a newspaper clip of Marcelas standing next to Obama. People would stop and stare at him in the streets of Seattle, then approach him to ask, \"Excuse me, are you that Obamacare kid?\" The photo he took with Obama became one of the most widely distributed images from the whole battle over Obamacare.\nThere was one group, though, that wasn't impressed. When he returned to his elementary school in Seattle, his classmates shrugged at the pictures of him with Obama.\n\"They thought it was boring,\" Marcelas says. \"They were like, 'So everybody meets the President.'\"\nAnother group gave him an even worse review. They said he was exploited by politicians and was too young to know what he was talking about. They were members of the conservative media. Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh said that Marcelas' mother would have died anyway because Obamacare didn't kick in until 2014. And conservative columnist Michelle Malkin said Democrats used Marcelas as a \"human kiddie shield.\" \nAnd then, of course, large swaths of the country had already mobilized to destroy Obamacare.\nAngry politicians said Obamacare would doom America; wide-eyed protesters at town hall meetings looked as if they were going to explode. When a reporter asked Marcelas about all the outrage over Obamacare and the criticism he was receiving, he shrugged.\n\"I don't have any bad comments,\" he said at the time. \"I just know my mom and grandmother told me that people are going to have their own opinions but that doesn't always make what they say right.\"\nToday, Marcelas says she wasn't a puppet manipulated by adults.\n\"I don't think I was too young,'' she says. \"No kid should have to see their parents struggle without health care and not be able to get care just because they're sick and missing workdays.\"\nAnother drama awaited Marcelas, but this time the struggle would take place within.\nTelling the one you love \nEven as just a boy, Marcelas had these questions: Why was he never interested in playing the games other boys played? Why did he like trying on his sister's clothes? Why did he feel he was born in the wrong body?\nHe started searching for answers. He went online and learned about transgender people. When he was in the fifth grade, he chose to write a class paper on a transgender woman.\n\"She was saying that when she was little she always identified more with girls,\" Marcelas says of the woman. \"I started realizing that I did the same.\"\nWhile gays and lesbians have moved to mainstream acceptance, transgender people are still often looked at with suspicion and are frequently victims of hate crimes. Former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, author Janet Mock and actress Laverne Cox are making people more aware of transgender people, but transgender people of color have only recently become prominent in popular culture.\nMarcelas didn't know it at the time, but he was moving from being involved in one explosive political issue to another -- all before reaching adolescence.\nOn the surface, though, Marcelas remained the Obamacare kid. He became an honor roll student, graduating from middle school magna cum laude with a 3.8 GPA. He got awards for being a community activist. He dutifully gave interviews each year when Obamacare's anniversary came around, once even wearing the same blue tie and vest he wore at the White House signing for a television interview.\nBut in private, he continued to dress in his sisters' clothes, buy girl's clothes on the side and hurriedly wipe off the makeup on his face when his grandmother returned home. \n\"I kept it to myself for a long time,\" she says now.\nMarcelas, though, outgrew the just-an-average-boy facade she had maintained, just as she outgrew the black suit she wore at the White House signing. At 16, she decided she wasn't going to wipe the makeup off her face anymore. She was going to tell the person she loved the most. \nIt was an autumn evening near dark and her grandmother was downstairs watching television. Marcelas put on a black wig, a red-and-white striped skirt and pink lipstick.\nThen she walked downstairs and stood before her grandmother. Owens didn't bat an eye, Marcelas recalls.\n\"Grandma, if I wanted to be a girl, what would you tell me that I should do?\"\nOwens thought Marcelas was joking at first. Then she realized her grandchild was serious. She told Marcelas that if she wanted her honest opinion, she preferred that she would stay a boy.\n\"But I would respect you if you decided to change and be somebody else,\" she said.\nShe hugged Marcelas, who returned upstairs -- where her sisters gave her tips on wearing makeup the right way.\nMarcelas says she didn't wear a skirt and makeup to shock her grandmother. She just wanted to get it all out at once.\n\"I wanted to tell her how I felt but also show her how I felt.\"\nHer grandmother's acceptance came as a relief.\n\"Even though she preferred me as a boy she respected my choice to choose,\" Marcelas says. \"That gave me a sort of blessing.\" \nHow did Owens, though, do in a moment what some people struggle a lifetime to do -- accept someone they love as transgender?\n\"I already had in my mind an inkling, so I really wasn't shocked,\" she says.\nWhen Marcelas turned 6, Owens asked him what he wanted for his birthday. He said a bouquet of flowers. And when she gave Marcelas the flowers, he paraded them before his friend as if it was a prize. When he was asked the same question for his birthday two years later, Marcelas asked for a pink dress shirt.\nYet another reason Owens was so accepting was because of her own struggles. She had learned to accept what she could not control.\nShe had lost her daughter, gone through a divorce, became disabled after a car accident and at one point became homeless when she lost a job. There is a steeliness about Owens. She talks in a calm, measured voice as if nothing can shake her anymore. On her Facebook page, she doesn't display her photo; she instead identifies herself with a graphic of a can with the caption, \"WHUP ASS.\"\n\"You learn how to be accepting of what comes next,\" she says, citing her struggles. \"You learn how to see things with an open eye and an open ear and not be judgmental.\"\n'I can't let that stop me'\nMarcelas hopes others feel the same way. She is starting to find out.\nOn March 9, the day before her 17th birthday, she wrote on Facebook:\n\"I've been learning about self-love. Finding myself may equal losing those I was once close to, I continue to search. Closed minds equal closed hearts, I remain forever open.\"\nShe's starting to give other glimpses of her transition to the outside world. She recently posted a Facebook selfie wearing makeup and lipstick.\nOne male commentator wrote back:  \n\"Bro males don't put on makeup unless their feminine\"\nMarcelas responded that there are other reasons for wearing makeup besides being gay.\nMarcelas is also starting to consider hormone therapy and other options. Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage to transgender people on the basis of their identity. The Obama administration ended a 33-year ban on Medicare coverage for gender reassignment surgery in 2014.\nWhen Marcelas began telling friends and classmates, the reaction was mixed. \n\"At first they thought I was joking,\" she says. \"Once they saw I was serious, they were confused, and then they got mad.\" \nOthers, however, went online to support her. \nOne Asian-American friend wrote:\n\"It's all good. I come from an Asian community and family and everybody freaking expects me to be some freaking sort of scholar and go to a 4 year university big college, but nope I ain't going cause' I love myself and my path.\"\n Another told Marcelas: \n\"Fully support you in this major transformational time. Be you. There's only one of you. Do it your way, with love.\"\nBut then again, there was another Marcelas -- the one in the photos standing next to Obama. For a long time, she couldn't be what she wanted because of what that photo represented to people.\n\"When I was thinking of coming out, I was thinking a lot of the Obamacare kid thing,\" she says. \"I was like, I'm the Obamacare kid and I have to live as the Obamacare kid. That was kind of my reason for not identifying as who I was.\"\nThen she realized that her experience as a kid didn't have to be a burden; it could be a blessing.\nIf she could help others in one struggle, why not another? Transgender teens, especially those of color, have few people to look up to. Maybe she could lead the way. If she could deal with Rush Limbaugh's scorn at 11, maybe she could handle being out in front of another divisive issue.\n\"This would be kind of a new thing,\" she says. \"I would help advance another issue. It'll be good for me.\" \nMarcelas not only looks different now; the world looks different as well.\n\"With me being able to express myself, I feel like everything has got a lot brighter,\" Marcelas says. \"When I was dressing in boy's clothes, that was something that felt unnatural. People are going to get to know the real me.\"\nWhen someone on Facebook posted the photo of Marcelas standing next to Obama, he commented that Marcelas looked so cute as a chubby little kid.\nMarcelas jumped on the comment thread with a message:\nShe's not the Obamacare kid anymore.\n\"The past is the past. We gotta' make new memories so when we look back it will be worth looking back on. I actually like me in the present better anyway.\" ", "FDA approves device to wean addicts off heroin": "The approval mirrors an Obama administration priority to make anti-addiction drugs more available. \nThe device is implanted in the arm and  releases a steady dose of the medication buprenorphine, which before had only been available as a pill, to curtail opioid cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms over six months.\n\"Opioid abuse and addiction have taken a devastating toll on American families,\" said  Dr. Robert M. Califf,\n \ncommissioner of the FDA, when the announcement was made Thursday.\n \n\"We must do everything we can to make new, innovative treatment options available that can help patients regain control over their lives.\" \nThe approval of the device, named Probuphine, \"provides the first-ever implantable option\" to help patients maintain treatment addiction, Califf said. Advocates said because it is implanted it will ensure patients do not miss their daily dose nor sell their supply to recreational users or other addicts.\nThe treatment still may fuel controversy from those who favor abstinence treatment and consider anti-addiction drugs substituting one drug for another.\nBut the FDA views expanding medication-assisted treatment, currently, methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone, \nas a cornerstone\n of its plan to decrease opioid overdose, death and dependance from heroin and opioids such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. \n\"Scientific evidence suggests that maintenance treatment with these medications in the context of behavioral treatment and recovery support are more effective in the treatment of opioid-use disorder than short-term detoxification programs aimed at abstinence,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health.\nAddiction growing more deadly\nTwo million Americans were dependent on prescription opioids in 2014, when the most recent data was available, federal statistics show.\nOverdoses linked to opioids \nkilled more than 28,000 peop\nle nationwide two years ago, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The deaths include those involving heroin and prescription drugs such as oxycodone and hydrocodone.\nEvery 19 minutes, someone dies from an accidental overdose, the CDC reports.\nAmericans represent just 5% of the world's population, but they consume 80% of the world's opioids, according to the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.\nMost drug overdose deaths -- at least six out of 10 -- involve an opioid, federal statistics show. \n\"Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, and so have sales of these prescription drugs,\" the CDC says. \nLately, much of the talk about opioid addiction has been centered on the difficulty in getting treatment. Critics say one of the hamstrings in treatment is limited access to buprenorphine  -- brand name Suboxone. Prescriptions to buprenorphine are limited by the federal law because of concern of  it ending up in nonpatient hands through trafficking on the black market.\nSuboxone \ncan be abused\n because it can be taken in the way to provide the same feeling of euphoria as opioids. \n\"Suboxone is an opioid medication,\" said Dr. Adam Bisaga, professor of psychiatry at CUMC and researcher at New York State Psychiatric Institute who works closely with heroin addicts. \"It can be misused. Some use it intravenously, they inject it, and they have lost control over the medication and are truly addicted. But that's really a small portion of patients. All the evidence shows that this is small.\"\nProbuphine  is supposed to deal with the diversion and overuse issues because it is implanted. As with other anti-addiction drugs, it is to be used in conjunction with behavioral treatment to help manage an addict's recovery and ease withdrawal from opioid drugs.\nProfits for developers Braeburn Pharmaceuticals and Titan Pharmaceuticals could be intense, with the six-month treatment reportedly running about $6,000.", "How much sex should you be having?": "In what might be welcome news for everyone exhausted from work and frazzled from kids, research suggests you don't have to get down every day to reap the rewards of sex, at least in terms of happiness and relationship closeness.\nA \nrecent study\n found that, although married people or people in committed relationships who had more sex tended to report feeling happier, the benefit leveled off at a sexual frequency of once a week. Those who said they did the deed four or more times a week did not report feeling any happier than those who had trysts only weekly.\n\"I do think couples can end up feeling pressure to try to engage in sex as frequently as possible,\" said \nAmy Muise\n, a postdoctoral researcher studying sexual relationships at Dalhousie University in Canada. Once a week \"is maybe a more realistic goal to set than thinking you have to have sex everyday and that feels overwhelming and you avoid it,\" said Muise, who is lead author of the study, which was published in November in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.\nThe study found that sex could boost happiness because it makes people feel more satisfied in their relationship, based on survey data from two separate cohorts, including 2,400 married couples in the U.S. National Survey of Families and Households. \n\"For people in relationships, their romantic relationship quality is one of the biggest predictors of their overall happiness,\" Muise said. \"Having sex more than once a week might not be enhancing that (relationship connection), although it is not bad.\" \nHowever, there are a couple of rubs with this research, Muise said. One is that it is not clear which came first, sex or happiness. It may be that people who have sex once a week or more were happier in their relationship and life to begin with, and not that the sex helped make them happy. Or both may be true: Sex enhances happiness and happiness enhances sex.  \nThe other catch is that, although a weekly romp might be just what some people need, it might be too much or too little for others. \"Certainly there are couples for whom having sex less frequently will be fine for their happiness, and there are couples who will get increases in happiness if they have sex more than once a week,\" Muise said. \nWhat's the right number for you?\n\"One of the best effects of an article like this (by Muise and her colleagues) is that it opens up conversations with couples\" about their sex life, said Vanessa Marin, a sex therapist based in Berlin. For some couples, the question of how often they should have sex might not have come up, which could be a sign they feel sufficiently close and satisfied -- or that they are just too busy or disconnected to think about it. \n\"Most couples want to be having more sex and I think this is really a result of how busy and full most of our lives are,\" Marin said.  \nMarin avoids prescribing an amount of sex that couples should have, because every couple is different, and instead recommends couples test it out for themselves. \"I'm a big fan of having clients experiment, like, one month try to have sex twice a week and see how that goes, or once a week, try to play around with it,\" Marin said. \nAs for those lucky couples that are content with how often they get busy under the sheets, \none study\n suggests they may not want to change a thing. Researchers asked couples that were having sex about six times a month to double down on getting down. Couples that doubled their sexual frequency were in worse moods and enjoyed sex less at the end of three months than couples who had stuck to their usual level of bedroom activity. \n\"Being told you should do something always makes it less fun,\" said George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the study. That is another reason Marin does not make recommendations to couples about sexual frequency -- for fear they could worry they are not living up to expectations and lose their mojo.\nHowever, there's a far bigger relationship problem than couples worrying they aren't having quite enough sex -- \"couples that have pretty much stopped having sex,\" Loewenstein said. For these couples, \"I think once a week is a good final goal. ... It is almost like a natural constant to do it once a week,\" he said.\nEven if these abstinent couples want to be having more sex, they may lack the desire for their partner. These couples can try conventional strategies, such as scheduling more quality time together or trying a change in scenery. \"What couple has not had the experience that you go to a hotel in a new location in a new environment and the person you're with seems different, and different is good when it comes to sex,\" Loewenstein said.\nBut if these tricks aren't enough, couples may have to appeal to their rational rather than lustful side and tell themselves to just do it. \"These couples might be surprised how enjoyable it would be if they restarted,\" Loewenstein said.\nShould you schedule your sex?\nIt might sound like the least romantic thing in the world to pencil in sexy time with your partner. But if you and your partner are game to try, there is no reason not to make a sex schedule.\n\"For some couples, scheduling sex works really well, it gives them something to look forward to, they like the anticipation, they like feeling prioritized,\" Marin said. \"Then other couples (say) scheduling sex feels horrible to them, like sex is transactional and just another item on their to-do list.\"\nAgain, Marin recommends couples experiment with scheduling sex to see if it helps them, as long as neither is opposed to it. \nA good idea for all couples, whether they like the idea of scheduling sex, is to plan for quality time together -- just the two of them. Ideally, this would be about 20 minutes a day with the TV off and cell phones away, but for extra busy couples, it can help to reserve just five minutes a day for a tete-a-tete, Marin said. This time is also the \"container for sex,\" the time and privacy when sex can be initiated, but you don't have to feel pressure about it, she added.\nAlthough scheduling sex can help couples that want to be having sex but just can't find the time, it can make things worse for some. \"If there are relationship issues or psychological issues such as stress or anxiety, then scheduling sex might just add to the pressure,\" said Acacia Parks, associate professor of psychology at Hiram College.  \nAs for when to schedule the sex, the best time is probably the time when you are least likely to be pulled away by life's obligations. One of the perks of rise-and-shine sex is that testosterone levels are highest in the morning, and this hormone drives sexual desire. On the other hand, tuck-you-in sex could help lull you to sleep, as hormones released during orgasm could help you relax and feel tired.\nAccording to Muise, the participants in her research typically reported having sex at night before going to sleep, which is not that surprising. But it has to work for both parties. \"This is another point of negotiation between partners,\" Muise said. \"One of them is just too exhausted. That might be something to play around with, is there a time on the weekend that we could try instead.\"", "Bedbugs are drawn to certain colors, study finds": "A new study finds that bedbugs -- just like \nflies\n and other insects -- have favorite colors. They really like dark red and black, and they shun dazzling white and bright yellow. \nResearchers placed bedbugs in Petri dishes that contained little bug-sized tents made of different colored paper. The bugs quickly crawled to the shelter, just as you would expect for insects that spend 90% of their lives hiding in cracks and crevices. But when given the chance, they gravitated toward the tents that were black and red instead of the white, yellow or green shelters.\n\"We joked that we are all going to buy bright yellow luggage bags because the bedbugs seem not to prefer them, or not to prefer laying eggs on them,\" said Roberto Pereira, an urban entomology research scientist at the University of Florida. Pereira was part of the team that carried out the research, which was published Monday in the Journal of Medical Entomology.\nOne of the most common ways to get bedbugs is when you stay at a hotel that has an infestation, and the insects or a few of their eggs hitch a ride home with you on your bag, Pereira said. Sunny-colored suitcases could help prevent that, although bedbugs might still be able to find dark folds in the fabric in which to stow away, he added. \nBefore you invest in a new set of luggage, there are probably better ways to keep bedbugs out of your home, said Dawn Gouge, an associate professor of urban entomology at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the new research.\nGouge uses suitcases with hard exteriors and encourages \"absolutely everyone to never bring luggage into their bedroom or onto a couch in the first place, and if they have an outdoor storage area (like a garage) where they can pack and unpack, that's the way to go.\" \nAlthough Gouge checks her hotel rooms for signs of bedbugs -- one is reddish stains on sheets -- she noted that fewer  than 1% of hotels and motels probably have them, and an infestation is sometimes hard to spot.\nBetter monitors?\nThe new study could provide some fresh insight into how to prevent bedbugs. \n\"The most valuable thing from this study is to say definitively, if we are monitoring for these bugs, we tend to rely on black or white traps. ... I am convinced I should be using the black ones\" because the insects might avoid the lighter colors, Gouge said. \nGouge conducts research on the best ways to monitor for bedbugs in homes and other environments, though she does not receive money from companies that make monitors or traps.\nTwo common monitors are Climbout, which is white, and Blackout, which is (as you might expect) black. They resemble bowls with tall walls and are placed under the leg of a bed or couch. Bedbugs climb over the walls and fall into the deep bowl, where they are trapped.\nAlthough these monitors are not enough to end a bedbug infestation -- that often requires removing furniture and using pesticides -- they can be very useful for determining whether you have insect houseguests. \n\"The sooner you find them, the easier, the cheaper and faster it is to get rid of the infestation,\" Gouge said.\nWhy do bedbugs like dark colors?\nThese apple seed-sized insects probably instinctively prefer black and red shelters over white and yellow ones because they offer better protection from predators such as ants and spiders, Pereira said. Bedbugs might also gravitate to black and red shelters because they mistake the colors for fellow bedbugs, and they generally like to stick together for protection.\nYet another reason could be that bright colors make the insects more exposed to light, and \"the more exposed these insects are, the more they lose water, and if they lose too much, they will die or have to feed again,\" Pereira said. \n\"It's hard to know what bedbugs are 'thinking,' if we can use that terminology,\" he said.\nPereira and his colleagues found that the dark color preference was true for bedbugs across the board, whether male or female, well-fed or hungry. The researchers let some of the bugs dine on live chickens, sparing humans the itchy bites, and other bedbugs were deprived their weekly blood meal. \nPregnant females also showed a strong penchant for laying eggs in the darker-hued tents. This behavior probably evolved millions of years ago to help protect their eggs, just like themselves, from predators, Pereira said.\nThere were some cases in which bedbugs did not display their usual aversion to light colors. For example, the littlest of bedbug babies, the ones in what is called the first instar of development, did not have any color preference when they crawled toward a paper tent, although more mature nymphs did prefer the dark shelters. \nThis behavior could be because the less mature bedbug nymphs have not developed the eyesight needed to distinguish between white, black and the rainbow of colors, Pereira said. \nHowever, Gouge suggested an alternative possibility: These babies are transparent, not having started feasting on the blood that makes their bodies red, brown or almost black. As a result, they can crawl onto any surface and be camouflaged, no matter what color it is.", "This is your brain on LSD, literally": "Using brain scanning and other techniques, researchers at \nImperial College London\n were able to show what happens when someone takes the popular (and illegal) psychedelic, scientific-name Lysergic acid diethylamide. \nThe findings may indicate how the drug produces the complex visual hallucinations often associated with its use. \nThe drug, as well as a placebo, was given to 20 healthy volunteers with previous experience taking psychedelics. Their brains were then imaged inside an fMRI scanner to visualize their brain activity.\n\"Under normal conditions, information from our eyes is processed in a part of the brain at the back of the head called the visual cortex,\" the researchers said \nin a statement\n. \n\"However, when the volunteers took LSD, many additional brain areas -- not just the visual cortex -- contributed to visual processing.\" \nImages of the brain under a hallucinogenic state showed almost the entire organ lit up with activity.\n\"We see this explosion of communication,\" said\n Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris\n, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, who led the study.\nThe visual cortex became much more active with the rest of the brain, and blood flow to visual regions also increased, which the researchers believe correlates with the hallucinations reported by volunteers.\nREAD: Why your brain works against your best intentions\n\"Our results suggest that this effect underlies the profound altered state of consciousness that people often describe during an LSD experience,\" Carhart-Harris added.\n\"It is also related to what people sometimes call 'ego-dissolution,' which means the normal sense of self is broken down and replaced by a sense of reconnection with themselves, others and the natural world. This experience is sometimes framed in a religious or spiritual way -- and seems to be associated with improvements in well-being after the drug's effects have subsided.\"\nRethinking LSD\nFirst manufactured in Switzerland in 1938 for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, LSD's subsequent popularity as a recreational psychedelic saw it criminalized in much of the world. \nIn both the United States and United Kingdom, LSD is a schedule 1 drug, the most restrictive classification. \nREAD: Test whether you have a happy brain\nHowever, in recent years, many scientists and others have advocated for a rethink of the drug's status, particularly its use for treating psychiatric disorders, \nalcoholism\n and depression. \nThe team at Imperial currently have clinical trials underway investigating the potential for \npsilocybin -- the active chemical inside magic mushrooms -- to treat depression\n, but believe LSD could be useful for disorders that are more difficult to treat, such as addiction.\n\"Conditions like addiction and alcohol dependence can be stubborn ... you might need something more potent to really make in-roads to conditions like [these],\" said Carhart-Harris.\nProfessor David Nutt, former chairman of the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and senior researcher on the study, has long argued for \nmore research into how psychedelics affect the brain\n and how they could be put to medical uses.\n\"Scientists have waited 50 years for this moment -- the revealing of how LSD alters our brain biology,\" Nutt said.\n\"For the first time we can really see what's happening in the brain during the psychedelic state, and can better understand why LSD had such a profound impact on self-awareness in users and on music and art. This could have great implications for psychiatry, and helping patients overcome conditions such as depression.\"\nREAD: How to solve a 300-year old maths puzzle\nAmanda Feilding, Director of the Beckley Foundation, which took part in the study, said: \"We are finally unveiling the brain mechanisms underlying the potential of LSD, not only to heal, but also to deepen our understanding of consciousness itself.\"", "Gorilla tragedy: Why are we so quick to blame the parents?": "As soon as word spread about\n the horrifying tragedy at the Cincinnati Zoo involving a 450-pound gorilla\n and a 3-year-old toddler, people took aim at the boy's mother, blaming her for the events that led zoo officials to kill the gorilla, named Harambe. \nMore than 430,000 people have now signed an online petition\n calling for criminal charges to be filed against the boy's parents for their \"lack of supervision and negligence\" and for child protective services to investigate the boy's home life.\nWhat we don't know is how many people who signed that petition are parents themselves. And the majority of the parents I connected with following the tragedy have an entirely different view. These parents have instead been reflecting on how they could have just as easily found themselves in a situation like this one.\n\"If you're a parent who hasn't lost your kid before, you're lying,\" said Buzz Bishop, a broadcaster and father of two boys from Calgary, Alberta. On \nhis blog DadCAMP\n, he's written about how he's lost track of his son for two minutes at places ranging from the grocery store and a hockey arena to a farming exhibition.\n\"I'm just glad on the most serious occasion, he had the sense to seek out a security guard and not jump through fences and into an animal enclosure,\" Bishop said. \"Kids are going to explore, we know that ... so they will get where they're not supposed to go. They just will.\"\nIt is during those minutes, or seconds, of distraction, inattention or daydreaming that your life can go terribly wrong. My moment occurred when my younger daughter was 2 or 3 -- a traumatizing memory I hate to remember. She was playing in a lake and in hindsight, I know I was standing way too far from the water. My husband, my mother-in-law and I were chatting, and I got distracted. The next thing I knew, she was head down in the water. \nThose next few seconds were the longest of my life. Thankfully, she was okay, but that moment could have easily had a very different ending.\n\"Every single parent can think of a time when something scary (or) unfortunate happened to their child,\" said Nikki Little, a mother of 3-year-old twin boys and an account director in social media for a public relations firm. \"It is not humanly possible to watch your child every single, waking second of the day.\"\nCathy Sharick, a mother of three, said her husband lost track of their son at the zoo when he was almost 3 years old. \"He had a tendency to run off at that age and the place was extremely crowded,\" said Sharick, who is executive editor of \nPower to Fly\n, an online platform that matches women with remote jobs in tech.\nThe whole zoo had to be shut down while officials searched for him. Luckily, he was found in a park going up and down a slide and not in an animal cage, she recalled.\n\"Things happen in a blink of an eye when you are a parent and unfortunately this little child ran off to an incredibly dangerous place and not to a park,\" said Sharick, who said she feels enormous empathy for both the gorilla that was killed and the mother of the little boy.\nShould parents be held accountable?\nWe are all susceptible to distractions and mistakes. At the same time, we also have a responsibility to avoid decisions, such as leaving young children home alone or letting them run freely in the street, that put our kids in harm's way.\nThe boy's mother was with the child at the time he managed to slip past a fence and fall into the enclosure, according to authorities. Cincinnati police announced they would be \ninvestigating the \"actions of the boy's parents/family that led up to the incident\" \nat the zoo. \nIf the mother is found to have acted in a negligent manner under the law, where she could have reasonably anticipated the danger and done something to prevent it from happening, she should be held accountable, some parents said. So should any of us if we find ourselves in a similar scenario.\nKelli Arena, a mother of three in Houston, has no interest in judging the parenting skills of the mother in question, but she does believe there should at least be a financial penalty. Arena wondered how long the child was maneuvering his way toward the enclosure. After asking the opinion of a friend who has experience working at zoos, she got the sense that it would have taken the boy some time to land where he did.\n\"The situation resulted in the killing of a rare animal and a financial loss for the zoo,\" said \nArena,\n an award-winning journalist and executive director of the \nGlobal Center for Journalism and Democracy at Sam Houston State University.\n \"She should at least be fined. As a society, we must remember there are consequences for our actions whether we think they are fair or not.\"\n'Why do we have to place blame on anyone?'\nWhat struck me and other parents was just how quickly we as a society want, or need, to assign blame -- and why we're so quick to toss blame at the parents, especially the mother.\nIn some ways, modern parents face a no-win situation: we're often blamed for being too protective and messing up our kids and society, or else for being too lax and doing equal damage.\n\"Why do we have to place blame on anyone? Something happened. Why do we have to place value on whether someone was right or wrong or \"good\" or \"bad\"? said Sharon Kennedy, a mom of two girls who are 7 and 9. \"I feel like we are all guilty of creating even more pain for ourselves, for the families that go through such tragedies ... rather than just focusing on how to effectively keep this from happening again.\"\nTelevision host Miss Lori\n, who has \nwritten about being terrified when she couldn't find her then 4-year-old daughter\n at an auto show, said, \"Imagine if all these people steamrolling the parents and the zookeepers about this incident were to invest their 'Monday Morning Quarterbacking' energy into actually becoming an expert in zoology, early childhood psychology or social work. Ah, what a world this would be.\"\nSome of our quickness to blame stems from the notion that there is such a thing as the \"perfect mother\" that always does the right thing, said \nAvital Norman Nathman\n, who explored the concept in an anthology on motherhood she edited, \n\"The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality.\"\n\"This is not an issue of a good or bad or neglectful parent,\" said Nathman, a mother of one who also wrote about the tragedy \nin a post for The Stir\n. \"This is a horrible circumstance that nobody could have predicted.

", "The Endless Table: How recipes keep memories alive": "The Brown University rare books librarian had never let physical limitations stand in his way, but when his brain stopped working the way he wanted it to -- at age 87 -- he knew that he needed to prepare for the end of his life. \nAdams' parents discussed his end of life wishes during a quiet, private evening before her mother, Virginia, let the rest of the family know. Thomas had decided to receive hospice care at home and in November 2008, the entire family gathered at his home in Providence, Rhode Island to care for him by his bedside. \nAdams did what she knew best -- she cooked for him.\nFood is love\nAdams, a famous Boston chef, had learned how to rejoice in food as a child from her father.  . \nEven though her mother did most of the cooking, he was known for a few mainstays, such as delicious cornmeal pancakes and the perfect mayonnaise, made from a supposedly top secret recipe -- Adams later learned the recipe was verbatim from \"The Joy of Cooking.\" \nAlthough her father's appetite was waning, Adams kept cooking for him until the end. He particularly loved the cream of mushroom soup recipe she had created just for him. \n\"I've always known the importance of food through bringing people together and nurturing them, but I also learned that food can be enormously healing,\" Adams said. \n\"This was how I could say goodbye with love. I put all of myself into that soup.\"\nHer father passed away on December 1, 2008. While the family felt the deep impact of his loss, nothing had been left unsaid and her father died the way that he had wanted to, surrounded by his loved ones.  \n\"We were all very present with him and it allowed him to let go and know that he was forgiven and he was sent off surrounded by love and warmth,\" said Adams. \n\"It showed me that death can be as important as birth, and as beautiful. Through my father's death, I learned so much about life.\" \nAdams recently shared her story of loss and food in a digital cookbook, \"\nThe Endless Table: Recipes from Departed Loved Ones\n.\" She was one of 20 top chefs to share their stories  relating to death in their families.\nA recipe for discussion\nThe stories -- and recipes -- for the cookbook were collected and edited by Ellen Goodman of \nThe Conversation Project\n  and Michael Hebb of \nDeath Over Dinner\n. \nThey both reached out to chefs they knew, or were acquainted with, like Ina Garten, Jose Andres, Tom Colicchio and Christopher Kimball to ask for their contribution and were amazed by the memories the chefs were willing to share. They shared everything from treasured family recipes to vignettes of personal loss, which inspired Goodman to each share a family recipe, and story, of their own. \nMany of the chefs had in fact already had these kinds of conversations with their loved ones and shared how liberating it was. They also revealed that making the recipes of their deceased loved helps maintain their memories and a connection to them. This was the aim of the project. \nAs well as maintain connections, Goodman and Hebb want their cookbook to encourage people to have end-of-life discussions with their loved ones before it's too late. \nGoodman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, co-founded The Conversation Project when she lost her mother to dementia, unable to know what she really wanted in the end when Goodman was faced with making choices on her behalf. \nCo-founded\nBoth Goodman and Hebb have since given TED talks on this subject highlighting how conversations that may seem intimidating, uncomfortable or even scary over a normal and soothing occasion like dinner can break their taboo.\n\"For some, talking about death is like letting it in the room,\" Goodman said. \"The end of life isn't just a medical thing that happens, it's a human experience. People aren't dying the way they want to or having their wishes honored...so having a conversation like this is a gift you give your family.\" \nTo make things easier, the cookbook also contains \na guide\n on how to approach talking about end-of-life wishes, compiled using advice from both health experts and families who have had successful discussions.\nTime for a toast\nApril 16 is \nNational Healthcare Decisions Day\n, which has inspired Goodman and Hebb to encourage families across the country to use the week as a chance to host a dinner party. \nThey want the occasion to be used to toast one another, honor people who have been lost, and for families to talk about their own end-of-life wishes -- because it's always too soon until it's too late, Goodman said. \nHebb, a former restaurateur, came up with the idea for Death Over Dinner when he struck up a conversation about mortality with two physicians on a train. This led to a class Hebb taught at the University of Washington in 2012 -- The Table of Truth: Reimagining the Dinner Table as Digital Media -- and soon grew into a social campaign. \nTo date, over 100,000 dinner parties inspired by Death Over Dinner have taken place across the country. \nThe diners begin by going around the room and acknowledging someone who has passed away and had a positive impact on people's lives, and raise a glass in their memory. The group can then decide how to progress in a \"choose your own adventure\" style approach, depending on who is in the group and the intention of the conversation. Based on the intention, they can work from a series of prompts provided by Hebb's website. \nA popular prompt\n \nasks what someone would do if they knew they had only 30 days left to live: How would they spend it, where are they, who are they with and what about the final day and hours of that day? \n\"Vulnerability begets vulnerability. People who have nothing in common reach a common ground almost immediately around this topic,\" said Hebb. \"It's people looking inside themselves within a group setting.\"\nHebb has seen the dinners change the relationship between a parent and a child as they each reveal things they've never told anyone else. \"It's not that people are afraid, it just needs a proper place. So just honor it with the space and time that it needs,\" he said.\nJasper White, a fellow Boston chef, also shared his recipes and memories in the digital cookbook and opened up during the project to stress that every death is not a tragedy. \n\"Love never dies,\" said White. \"Neither do recipes, and it's a wonderful way to remember someone.\"", "The other 'fingerprints' you don't know about": "Do your ears hang low? Wobble to and fro?\nIt turns out the ridges, bumps and shape of your outer ear are so unique that it may soon be one of the best ways to identify you. According to University of Southampton \nbiometrics expert Mark Nixon\n, studies have shown up to 99.6% accuracy when ears were scanned using computer software that recreates their \nposition, scale and rotation\n. That's the same accuracy as fingerprints.\nYour ear is fully shaped when you are born, and changes little after about age 10. It does grow larger and begin to sag as you age because of the effects of gravity, but that is a measurable effect; in fact it has been calculated to be just \n1.22 mm per year.\n So unless you damage your ears, by say getting into a fight with Mike Tyson, it's a pretty reliable measurement.  \n Research in this area is exploding. A \nrecent study \nshowed you can even identify gender by 2-D and 3-D images of ears (and women do tend to have smaller ears than men). Of course you can easily hide ears with hair, hats, scarves and other clothing, but when a profile is all you have to work from to identify someone, that unique ear shape could be very helpful.\nThe eyes have it\nLook in the mirror at both your eyes. Now look closely at each iris. That's the muscle that opens and closes your pupil to control the amount of light that enters your eye. You'll see small, random patterns of texture in one of your irises, which are completely different from the texture in your other iris.  How does that happen?  \nWhile your DNA does set the ultimate color and structure of each iris, the furrows, rifts and pits you see happen randomly during fetal development in the womb. It's called \"chaotic morphogenesis,\" and is thought to occur when \niris tissue tightens and folds\n as the fetus opens and shuts its developing eyes. Just like fingerprints, identical twins don't share the same iris swirls and patterns, so each of their irises is also unique.\nBecause the iris is protected behind the cornea, it was long though that these unique patterns never changed, making an iris identification nearly foolproof. However, recent studies show the \niris does degrade\n, perhaps from age or from damage, such as \ncontact lens use\n.\nStill, researchers such as \nMarios Savvides\n of Carnegie Mellon's CyLab are excited by the possibilities. \"As long as the part of the eye over the iris region remains unaltered from disease then iris recognition will not be affected,\" said Savvides. \"We are working on extracting iris features from high resolution visible photos and matching them against other high resolution photos of irises\" and have been able to match those, which is \"an exciting finding.\"\n\"We have also demonstrated capturing an iris from a person in a stopped vehicle to depict the scenario where a police officer could identify who the driver is before approaching. Iris recognition and in particular long-range iris recognition can [also] help identify victims of human trafficking or abduction and alert authorities,\" added Savvides. \nYou can tell by the way I walk\nNo, I'm not talking about John Cleese's \"Ministry of Silly Walks.\" You don't have to be that outrageous to be identified by your gait.  \n\"Several decades ago researchers put lights on ankles, knees, hips and figured out you could recognize friends by the way they walk,\" said University of Notre Dame \nbiometrics expert Kevin Bowyer\n.  Today computers can identify a person in a crowded city block by their walk.\nNixon pioneered much of the research in gait analysis.  \"We removed every other variable we could to test the hypothesis, which is why \nwe used a green screen,\n\" he said. \"All we had was a person walking in a series of images.  We look at the motion of the body and the body parts, then measured those with a computer to get a set of numbers. And as long as we get the same set of numbers for each person, we can achieve recognition.\"\nNixon recently put his computers to the test in a murder trial in Australia. \"The guy killed a man and his wife in a shop.  He had cased the joint in the morning and we had surveillance footage of him.  Then when he came back in the evening he wore a mask and gloves and covered his head.  All we could see of him was the way he walked.  We presented evidence that the gait was the same; the guy put his hands up and said 'Yeah, it was me'.\"\nThe mouth has spoken\nThe next time someone sticks out their tongue at you, take a closer look.  See all those tiny bumps and ridges?  \"It's the different distribution of size and shape, just as fingerprints,\" said Bowyer, that makes your tongue unique to you and no one else.  The bumps contain more than 10,000 taste buds, each one filled with microscopic hairs called microvilli.  Microvilli function like tiny food critics, sensing if your meal is sweet or sour, salty or bitter, and sending reviews up to the brain. \nYour voice is another way to identify you, and each of us have \nunique characteristics\n formed by the length of our vocal tract, the frequency and intensity of our vocal quality, and how we've learned to speak.  Because it's so easy for someone to mimic another voice, you have to use a computer to tell the differences, and science is working hard on that.\nEach person's set of teeth is also unique, but that's because of what you do to them, like clenching or grinding or sucking your thumb. Because of those environmental differences, even identical twins do not have exactly the same set of teeth.\nDental records are often used to identify a body in forensics, but you don't see anyone running out to take tongue prints, although it is the only internal body organ that can quite easily be exposed for inspection.  Say ah!\nThe window into your nervous system, and maybe your soul\nThe very back of your eye, the part where light rays focus, is called the retina. The pattern of blood vessels displayed there is a very precise snapshot of your nervous system \u2014 unique to you. While it's widely used in the \nanimal world\n to verify the identity of show cattle and purebred horses, as well as track food safety and disease outbreaks, use in humans has been limited. \nExcept in your eye doctor's office. The retina is the only place in your body where doctors can see your \ncentral nervous system without surgery\n. Ophthalmologists can see first signs of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, high blood pressure, even \nbrain health\n during your annual checkup.\nFingerprints no longer the gold standard\nNo one else has your exact fingerprints, even your identical twin. How can that be? It starts when you're a fetus, between 1 and 3 inches long, and the pads on your fingers and palms begin to grow. As the skin forms and thickens over the next month or two, it comes into contact with other structures in the womb, which start to \ncreate ridges on the skin of the fingertip.\n  The density of your mom's amniotic fluid, how much you move, and your position in the womb are all thought to affect how those ridges form.\n\"Where the lines end or join is determined randomly,\" Bowyer said. \"We know you're supposed to have 10 fingers and 10 fingerprints, but the detail of the pattern isn't predictable.\" \nBy the time mom is in her sixth month of pregnancy, your fingerprints have fully formed the arches, loops and whorls we use to\n match fingerprints\n, with lots of other unique patterns scattered in between.\nOnce considered the \"gold standard\" of identification, fingerprints have lost some of their luster because they can be degraded or damaged, such as by chemical burns or having a career as a bricklayer. In one case, a man lost his fingerprints when a \ncommon cancer drug\n caused the skin to peel. Still, fingerprints are commonly used by law enforcement, forensics and companies such as Apple for personal identification. \nRecent studies believe we can now even tell \ngender from fingerprints\n.\nRelated: 5 biometric alternatives to the password\nSome people are born without fingerprints. It's called adermatoglyphia, and is a very rare disorder caused by mutations in the SMARCAD1 gene. According to the National Institutes of Health, it's also called \"\nimmigration delay disease\n\" because those who have it have lots of problems when they try to enter countries requiring fingerprinting for identification.\nDNA is still the gold standard \nDNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid as it is rarely pronounced, is the genetic formula that tells your cells how to build you into you, and no one else.  \nThink of your DNA as four Legos that like to play in pairs along a spiral staircase called a double helix. Those pairs (A and T; C and G) form building blocks of code called genes that become the blueprint for your hair, eyes, body shape and everything else that makes you unique.\nThere are nearly 20,000 human genes, created from about 3 billion bases, so it's easy to see why no other human will have the \nexact same pattern of DNA\n. Unless you have an identical twin, right?\nBut wait, that truism is no longer true. \nBreakthrough studies\n in the last year show even identical twins have different DNA. Using \nsecond generation genome sequencing\n, said Bowyer, \"you find that once that fertilized egg splits there are random mutations that are happening and that can be used to identify differences between twins.\"\nCalled single nucleotide polymorphisms, or \"Snips,\" these \"\ntypos\" in the DNA sequence\n are being studied to shed light on how we differ in our response to drugs, environmental toxins and why one of us might get a particular disease, even if our twin didn't. ", "Doctor with spina bifida defies expectations": "My loving parents refused to take the advice of skeptical doctors when I was born with a closed form of \nspina bifida\n (a spine condition). They were encouraged to place me in an institution, go about their lives and have another child. Being Catholic, it struck them as an impossible choice and thus resigned themselves to help me live the best life possible. \nTheir ability to see me as capable instead of handicapped has permeated my life. Rather than emphasizing what I couldn't do, I was encouraged to maximize what I could do.  \nI was fortunate to receive an excellent education.  First as an undergraduate at Yale and then at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.  When I hear others lauding my accomplishments and emphasizing the obstacles I have overcome, I smile and think about the opportunities my family gave me and the choices I made on this incredible journey.  \nFrom an early age, I wanted to be a doctor. Perhaps because I believed that even in the worst economic times, there would still be a need for physicians and I would always be useful.  \nI also loved science. How organisms work still amazes and delights me. I treasure the continuous journey of discovery in the medical field.   \nMy own journey is an example of just how far we have come in our understanding of spina bifida. It comes in many forms and outcomes can vary. Thus, when I read my own chart, I was struck by the pessimism of its opening line: \"This unfortunate 5 month old infant.\"  \nBecause there were no role models exactly like me, I felt the freedom to find my own path. Medicine is always about the patient and our ability to help that patient, so I have worked hard to be certain my skills matched the job at hand.  \nNeurosurgery excites me intellectually and I still find the nervous system the most beautiful organ. I was dumbstruck by the first neurosurgical operation I saw as a medical student, and still find I am excited whenever I enter the operating room.  \nI have worn a leg brace and built-up shoe most of my life. I had several surgeries as a child and learned to walk on three separate occasions.   I have been a patient at various points in my life and remember those times vividly. I draw on that experience as I treat my own patients.  \nMost recently, I began to gradually lose function in my legs and required another operation.  I sought the advice of many neurosurgeons and knew the complexity of the anatomy.  Like all patients, I was hoping -- no expecting -- a perfect outcome.  But I am now in a wheelchair and have to modify what I do as a surgeon to remain safe and effective. \nPeople often ask me which has been harder -- being a woman neurosurgeon or having a disability as a surgeon.  Being a woman was more difficult.  \nWhen I applied for neurosurgical residency, I was usually the first woman applying.  I was the first woman accepted at Columbia.  Across the years, I have experienced sexist jokes and the endless all-male meetings where I have heard the salutation \"Gentlemen.\"  I have experienced sexual harassment and been told I didn't need a raise because I wasn't married and didn't have children.  \nWhen I was appointed chair of neurosurgery at the University of Michigan in 2005, I was the first woman in the United States to have such a position.  Eleven years later, I remain the only woman to chair a neurosurgery department. \nAn estimated\n 20 percent of residents in neurological surgery are now women\n.  I have always chosen to work from within to create change and believe I can now see the outcome of these efforts. \nI am still wildly in love with neurosurgery but realize I have had many advantages that allowed me to pursue my dreams.  Besides my parents, I have been blessed with a loving husband and two great kids, friends who were honest critics and ardent supporters, colleagues who sustained me through the transitions of my career and, most importantly, patients who judged me on the quality of my work and allowed me the privilege to treat them and their loved ones. I have been in practice long enough to have patients send me notes about graduations, marriages and babies.\nI know life is not about overcoming, but about following the voice inside you.  ", "Should you be aiming for 10,000 steps a day?": "DailyBurn: The 15 Most Underrated Exercises, According to Trainers\nFirst, a quick history lesson: While manufacturers of fitness trackers such as FitBit and Garmin might very well be responsible for the current 10,000-step fixation, the hype actually started in Japan back in the 1960s. While the Tokyo Olympics was happening, locals started thinking about their own fitness prowess. Soon after, the first commercial pedometer \u2014 called the manpo-meter \u2014 was introduced.\nDailyBurn: Gym Time or Meal Time: What Matters Most for Weight Loss?\nManpo means 10,000 steps in Japanese, and the number was selected after research revealed that men who burn at least 2,000 calories per week by exercising have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. That breaks down to about 300 calories per day, which most people can torch by taking 10,000 steps, explains David R. Bassett, Jr., professor of kinesiology, recreation, and sport studies at the University of Tennessee.\nDailyBurn: I'm Exercising More \u2014 So Why Am I Gaining Weight?\nSince then, there's been plenty of other research proving that 10,000 steps a day \u2014 which equals about five miles \u2014 can help your health. \"There are over 300 peer-reviewed articles with a focus on the 10,000 steps per day protocol,\" says Jinger S. Gottschall, associate professor of kinesiology at Penn State. One study, for example, found that people who take more than 10,000 steps a day have lower blood pressure levels and better cardiovascular fitness. Another determined that getting close to 10,000 steps helps lower blood glucose levels and cuts the risk of developing diabetes. Experts also say that this amount of activity can help you maintain your weight.\nWhen 10,000 Steps a Day Is Too Much\nOf course, there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all prescription for fitness, and for some people, 10,000 steps might be overkill. If you're \nnew to exercise\n, you'll want to aim for a slightly less ambitious target, says Gottschall. Try shooting for 3,000 steps per day, three to five days a week. Each week, tack on another 500 steps per day. You should end up hitting the 10,000-per-day mark in a few months.\nPeople over 65 might also be OK with getting a little less, says Bassett. \"I'm my opinion, 10,000 steps a day is a good goal for young- to- middle-aged adults,\" but it might be too much for some seniors.\nShould You Aim Higher?\nAlthough 10,000 steps might sound like a lot, you'll need to move more if your goal is weight loss. While this amount of activity can help keep your weight steady, it isn't usually enough to make the scale go down.\nPeople who are already pretty active should also aim higher; that's the only way you'll see your fitness level continue to rise. (\nHere's why your fitness tracker isn't making you thinner\n \u2014 yet.) Try extending the duration of your workouts by 10 percent each week. Or up the intensity by jogging or running that same number of steps instead of walking, says Gottschall.\nMixing things up is also ideal, so it's best to engage in a variety of activities \u2014 say, swimming or biking, in addition to walking or running. Be sure to add some strength training to your routine as well.\nGot kids? Children ages 6 to 12 definitely need extra activity; the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition suggests that they get at least 12,000 steps.\nHow to Up Your Count, One Step at a Time\nSimply strapping on a fitness tracker \u2014 whether it's a $9 drugstore pedometer or a fancier gadget that measures your heart rate and the number of calories you burn \u2014 can get you motivated, at least initially. You've probably heard that little things, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking further from a building's entrance, can help, too. That's true, but you'll probably have to make a bigger effort if you're serious about meeting your daily step goal, says Bassett. Here are a few tricks to try:\nInstead of \"park and ride,\" do the \"park and walk,\" says Bassett. Drive until you're a mile or two from your office, then hoof it the rest of the way.\nTake your kids on a treasure hunt, complete with a map and prizes. Or get in on a real-life treasure hunt by joining the geocaching craze. All you need is a GPS-enabled device (such as your smartphone).\nHost a walking meeting instead of joining your team at the conference table.\nGet a treadmill desk.

We can all, with the exception of African people, credit Neanderthals for around 2% of our genome. (Our ancestors apparently started hooking up with their stocky cousins after moving out of Africa.)\nNow it seems Neanderthals were not the only interbreeding game in town. The new study finds that Denisovans interbred with the distant ancestors of people living in what is now South Asia, including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Previously the only people known to have detectable traces of Denisovan DNA were in \nPapua New Guinea\n, Australia, China and other parts of East Asia.\nThe inter-hominin mating, both with Neanderthals and Denisovans, seemed to bestow our ancestors with \nadvantageous traits\n, such as \nthicker hair\n (thanks, Neanderthals) and ability to live at \nhigh altitudes\n (courtesy of Denisovans). However the new study suggests that there could also have been evolutionary downsides to interbreeding, such as reduced fertility.\n\"The South Asia finding was a bit of a surprise. It is not explainable by what we know about human history,\" said Sriram Sankararaman, assistant professor of computer science and human genetics at the University of California-Los Angeles. Sankararaman is the lead author of \nthe study,\n which was published Monday in Current Biology.\nResearchers had been thinking that our ancestors could have picked up Denisovan DNA just once, when one population of our ancestors intermingled with one population of Denisovans, and then the descendants moved to East Asia and the Pacific Islands. Although that still could have happened, Sankararaman said these findings also raise the possibility that Homo sapiens made babies with Denisovans in three different areas, including South Asia. \nThe current study and previous research suggest that we can no longer think of our ancestors as interbreeding with other hominins only once, said John Hawks, professor of anthropology at University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"It is happening repeatedly, wherever modern humans are coming into contact with these archaic people,\" said Hawks, who was not involved in the current study.\nOf all the nationalities today, Papua New Guineans and Australians can claim the most Denisovan DNA, about 5% of their genome, followed by South Asians, and then East Asians and Native Americans, all at around 2%. Europeans have no detectable Denisovan DNA.\nWhat's in your caveman genes?\nLooking at the kind of Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA we possess \"is a first step to understanding the (genomic) regions which might have been important for modern humans,\" Sankararaman said.  We can also learn a lot from the regions of our genome where cave man DNA is glaringly absent.\nThe current study found some of the most prevalent Neanderthal genes are associated with thicker skin and hair, just as \nprevious research concluded\n. \n\"You have humans that lived in Africa, and now they are going into different environments in the world and there are already populations (of Neanderthals and Denisovans) that adapted to those environments. And so, for the modern humans it almost makes sense that they borrow the genes from them,\" Sankararaman said.\nThe study also found evidence that our ancestors may not have passed on certain parts of the genome from their hominin cousins, such as a less evolutionarily advanced version of the FOXP2 gene, which is thought to play a role in language and speech.\n\"We all agree there has been positive and negative selection. ... It is interesting that similar regions in both Neanderthal and Denisovans, like FOXP2, had negative selection,\" said Rasmus Nielsen, professor of evolutionary biology at University of California-Berkeley, who was not involved in the current research.\nAnother group of genes that seems to be avoided by early humans, from an evolutionary standpoint, is involved in reproduction. This finding suggests that the offspring of an early human and Neanderthal or Denisovan pairing could have been less able to procreate and pass on their genes. If interbreeding reduces fertility, Hawks said, \"that creates the expectation that maybe (these three hominins) were different species,\" which has been a matter of debate.", "10 deadly diseases you thought were gone": "Changes to our living conditions and the development of medicines have affected the rise and fall of diseases, but they seldom disappear. To date, smallpox remains the only disease to have ever been eradicated.\nHere are some often-forgotten diseases that still exist -- despite our best efforts to control them. \nPlague\nIn the 14th century, plague -- known as the Black Death -- killed an estimated 60% of the European population. Plague is spread by fleas living on rodents, such as rats and squirrels, but the development vaccines and antibiotics, and improved living conditions, have curtailed the spread of the disease\nPlague is rare in developed countries today, with roughly two to 10 cases reported in the United States annually, where there have been 16 cases so far this year.\nBut the disease persists elsewhere. The WHO reports 1,000 to 3,000 global cases of plague every year. Africa, South America and Asia have the greatest number of cases -- particularly Madagascar, Peru and India.\nRead: How do we still have plague?\nRubella\nThe virus, which is passed to babies in the womb from unvaccinated mothers, can cause multiple birth defects as well as fetal death when contracted by women during pregnancy.\nRubella vaccinations first became available in 1970, helping many developed countries come close to eliminating the disease and in April 2015, the Americas became the first region to eliminate rubella, after a 15-year vaccination campaign.\nBut the infection remains in countries with low immunization coverage, particularly in Africa and south-east Asia. An estimated 110,000 babies are born with Congenital Rubella Syndrome every year.\nLeprosy\nLeprosy is a contagious disease transmitted by prolonged contact with infected people. It causes damage to nerve and skin cells resulting in disfiguring sores and permanent disabilities. \nThe first breakthrough in leprosy treatment came in 1945, with the drug dapsone, but bacteria soon became resistant. This lead to the development of a successful multidrug therapy in the 1970s. \nThe number of global leprosy cases has dropped significantly in the last 30 years, from 5.2 million in 1985 -- but there were still 216,000 cases in 2013. The disease is still a problem in parts of India, Brazil and Indonesia where more than 80% of cases occur.\nRead: The dark history of America's forgotten leper colony\nGout\nGout is a type of arthritis caused by the build up of uric acid or urates -- a natural by-product of digestion -- inside joints. This can lead to pain, swelling and redness. First identified by the Egyptians, Gout was once known as the \"disease of kings\" because of its links to excessive food and alcohol consumption.\nUnhealthy lifestyles and obesity have caused dramatic increases of gout in developed countries, with the condition now affecting an estimated 8.3 million North Americans -- nearly 4% of the adult population -- \naccording to one study\n. \nThe prevalence of gout \nvaries significantly around the world\n -- at 4.75% Greece has the highest rate in Europe, according to a \n2010 study\n. \nWhooping cough\nWhopping cough, or pertussis, is an airborne infection that swells the airways. It causes intense coughing, with particularly serious effects for babies. \nBefore the 1940s there were more than 200,000 cases of whooping cough in the United States each year, until widespread vaccination reduced new infections by 80%. But outbreaks still occur. In 2010, \nCalifornia suffered its worst outbreak \nin 60 years, with close to 1,500 cases and 10 deaths.\nThere were an estimated 16 million global cases in 2008 -- 95% in developing countries -- killing about 195,000 children.\nDiphtheria\nThis disease affects the nose and throat and is passed on by coughing or sneezing. It kills 5-10% of patients who catch it. \nIt was once a major childhood killer. The United States recorded 206,000 cases in 1921, causing more than 15,000 deaths.\nVaccination programs meant it declined rapidly, with only five cases of diphtheria reported in the United States in the last decade. But in the developing world it remains a problem.\nIn 2011 nearly 5,000 cases of diphtheria were recorded globally, with many more likely unreported. It continues to be a problem in parts of Africa and Asia -- mostly due to poor vaccination coverage.\nScarlet fever\nThis disease is caused by bacteria found on the skin and throat, producing a distinctive pink-red rash. The bacteria is spread by sneezing and coughing, touching skin with infections such as impetigo, or sharing contaminated linen. There is still no vaccine.\nFrom 1840 to 1883, fatality rates of scarlet fever exceeded 30% in some parts of the U.S. and Europe. But from the 1950s, antibiotics and improved living conditions made the disease rare in developed countries.  \nIn 2014, more than 14,000 cases of Scarlet fever were reported in the United Kingdom -- the highest surge since the late 1960s -- and infections have continued in 2015. Globally, outbreaks of this rare disease continue to occur -- though rare -- with 1,500 cases and two fatalities reported in Hong Kong in 2011. \nTB\nKnown as the \"White Plague\" as it ravaged 18th-century Europe, tuberculosis (TB) is now the world's biggest infectious killer, ahead of HIV. \nMore than 9,400 people were infected in the United States in 2014. Globally, TB killed an estimated 1.5 million people in 2013, whilst 9 million developed the disease. TB is treatable but drug-resistant forms cause further challenges in controlling the disease.\nThe infection is spread through the air, aided by overcrowded housing and poor ventilation. Strong immune systems can normally fight off the disease but TB takes hold in patients with weakened defenses -- particularly people with HIV. \nRead: Return of the 'White Plague'\nRickets\nRickets is a disease that softens and bends children's bones. Commonly caused by a lack of vitamin D and calcium, it's often thought of as a 19th-century condition.\nAutopsy studies in parts of the Netherlands showed that in the late 19th century, 80-90% of children had rickets, but improved living conditions in developed countries made the disease so rare that many governments stopped tracking it. \nAlthough there's a lack of comprehensive data on the global rates of rickets, experts believe that less time spent outdoors (sunlight is converted into Vitamin D) combined with inadequate Vitamin D and calcium in some diets, is causing it to make a comeback in developed countries. \nPolio\nHumans have been living with polio for thousands of years. The virus spreads through contact with infected feces or sneeze droplets, reaching the brain and spinal cord and causing paralysis in some cases. In the 1940s and 1950s, in the U.S. alone about 35,000 people annually became disabled because of polio.\nEffective vaccines were developed in the 1950s and 60s. When the Global Polio Eradication Initiative began in 1988, polio paralyzed more than 1,000 children worldwide every day. Since then, more than 2.5 billion children have been immunized, decreasing global polio cases by 99%.\nIn 2015, just 51 cases of wild polio virus have been reported so far, all in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nRead:  Ending polio -- 'we're on the verge of making history'", "15-year-old loses 100 pounds to reach bodybuilding dream": "And perhaps most impressive, MacKenzie has lost -- and kept off -- 100 pounds. \n\"She never misses the gym,\" her dad, Scott Walker, said. \"If I say, 'I want ice cream,' she said, 'Dad, I don't have the (macronutrients) for that.' She won't cheat on her diet.\" \nMacKenzie dreams of being Ms. Olympia, the world's best female bodybuilder. Envisioning her in that role is a bit of a stretch for strangers looking at her tiny 5-foot-5-inch frame. But those who know what she's already done to reach her goals have no trouble imagining it. \nFilling a never-ending void\nAfter MacKenzie's parents divorced when she was 9, she lived with her father and brother in her grandfather's house in Windsor, Ontario, just across the border from Detroit. MacKenzie spent most of her time in the basement, looking at YouTube videos, eating hot dogs and French fries and drinking soda by the pack. \n\"I ate a whole pizza in a night,\" she recalled. \"I didn't know the feeling of being full.\" \nEntering fifth grade, MacKenzie weighed 170 pounds. By the time eighth grade rolled around, she had reached 223 pounds. She developed a defense mechanism to ward off bullies -- her friends loved when she made gross faces and mocked her own double chin. \nShe worried occasionally about Type 2 diabetes -- her grandmother lost a leg to the disease -- but couldn't seem to stick to diets she halfheartedly attempted. \nThen, in March 2013, MacKenzie went shopping for her eighth grade graduation dress. She had made a pact with her best guy friend that they would kiss for the first time. She looked for size 16 dresses, but after she tried a few on, the salesclerk directed her to another store. She walked out with a size 22 dress. \n\"That was where my heart just kind of sank,\" she said. \"Thoughts started rolling in about dying, of not waking up one morning.\" \nOn grad night, MacKenzie chickened out on the kiss. \"I couldn't even look him in the eyes because I felt so bad for him.\" \nShe went home and swore she was going on a diet, but again failed to follow through. \nIn September, MacKenzie entered high school at around 200 pounds. She walked down the halls thinking about all the people who must be staring at her, \"the fat girl.\" After a few weeks, she'd had enough. Her dad had signed up for gastric bypass surgery and was about to go on a presurgery liquid fast. She decided she would match his weight loss by going on a diet of her own. \nOn September 24, 2013, she sat her dad down and told him, \"This is it. I am doing this one last time. Please don't let me quit.\"\nThe myth of the 'after' picture\nThe first 45 pounds were almost easy. MacKenzie stopped eating after 7 p.m., prepared a week's worth of healthy breakfasts, lunches and dinners on the weekend, and jogged every night around a local park. \nIn December 2013, she signed up for \nInstagram\n and her world exploded with inspiration. She followed bodybuilders who had the sculpted physique she dreamed of. She discovered the \nInsanity fitness program\n. She learned from fellow Instagrammers that she wasn't eating enough, and was doing too much cardio, so she increased her calorie intake and began lifting weights. \nShe tried a low-carb diet, carb-cycling and clean eating, then finally started \ncounting macronutrients\n, the eating plan she follows today. \nBy March 2014, she had lost 70 pounds. But her dream \"after\" photo remained elusive. \nBecause she had lost so much weight so rapidly, MacKenzie had a \"hang,\" or loose skin hanging from her stomach. It's a common problem for people who lose a large amount of weight; they often find the skin around their thighs, middle, arms or neck doesn't snap back into place. As MacKenzie's doctor told her, \"Once you blow up a balloon, it's always going to have wrinkles in it.\"\nMacKenzie used the hang as motivation, pushing herself harder at the gym. But she started experiencing back pain from having her center of gravity constantly pulled forward. And the hang got itchy and hot, even in Ontario's freezing winters. \nHer trainer told her she needed an abdominoplasty, better known as a tummy tuck. But for every plea MacKenzie sent to plastic surgeons in Canada and the United States, requests were denied, her age circled in red. \nPlastic surgeons have to be cautious about adolescent patients, said Dr. Felmont Eaves, former president of the \nAmerican Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery\n, who was not involved in MacKenzie's case. Teens, he said, often base their decisions on social status or emotional insecurities. It's a dilemma more plastic surgeons may have to face as parents and experts \nfight back\n against \nchildhood obesity\n, and \nmore hospitals\n accept adolescent bariatric surgery patients. \n\"It's important to understand their motivation and where they are psychologically,\" Eaves said. \"You don't want to operate on something you don't have to.\" \nRebound is a big concern with weight loss, he said; patients who have lost a lot of weight are \nat high risk\n for gaining it back. A lot of surgeons also encourage female patients to wait until after childbirth to have a tummy tuck done. Still, if an adolescent patient shows a healthy attitude, commitment to change and realistic expectations about surgery, she is really no different from a healthy adult patient, Eaves said. \n\"There are some 16-year-olds who are amazingly secure and have good insight, and there are 25-year-olds who are clueless,\" he said. \"So as long as they're mature enough to follow instructions, ... having this type of operation would be very reasonable.\"\nMaturity is exactly what \nDr. Anthony Youn\n saw in MacKenzie when he read her email. \"She wasn't asking for a Barbie doll body,\" he said. \"She told me what she wanted to lose -- and it was all the signs of her previous life, the life before she took as good care of herself as she is now.\" \nYoun scheduled a consultation with MacKenzie and her father at his office in Troy, Michigan. He was impressed by the research they'd done and agreed to perform the surgery at the end of July. The only problem: It would cost the Walkers close to $9,000. \n\"How do we afford that?\" Scott Walker remembered thinking. \"We're an average working family. I'm a single parent, and to afford a surgery that expensive ... I didn't know how I would come up with the funding.\" \nTrue to form, MacKenzie didn't let that stop her. She set up a GoFundMe page online and asked her Instagram followers for help. Then she turned to her coach, Chris Jones, aka Beastmode Jones, who is well-known in the online fitness world. Close to 700,000 people subscribe to his YouTube channel, which features video tutorials for bodybuilders and his clients. Jones posted a video asking for help for MacKenzie. In less than two months, MacKenzie had the funds she needed.\nStrong family bonds\nMacKenzie's Instagram feed is full of selfies -- MacKenzie posing in the mirror at the gym; MacKenzie showing off her muscles; MacKenzie's before and after shots. If the likes and comments on her posts are any indication, her followers love it. In January, she published a 30-page e-book about her weight loss journey, which she sold for $13 \non her website\n.\nShe used the money she earned from the book sales to take her dad to Disney World for his 50th birthday. \"(The book) did really well,\" she said modestly, shrugging her shoulders. \nThe father-daughter duo are incredibly close. Scott Walker went through his own weight loss journey after gastric bypass surgery, going from 276 pounds to 160. They support each other, each making sure the other never veers too far off track. Scott manages MacKenzie's website, where she interacts with her clients. She typically has around 50 for whom she provides weekly training and eating plans. \nAs MacKenzie headed into her tummy tuck surgery on July 28, Scott Walker leaned down and kissed his daughter on the forehead. His words seemed to stick in his throat: \"I'm going to be waiting for you. I'll see you after. I love you.\" \n\"Come on, Dad, keep it together,\" MacKenzie joked as she was wheeled toward the operating room.\nAny surgery carries risk, Youn said. With an abdominoplasty, there's a risk of bleeding and blood clots. Tummy tucks have a particularly high risk of \ndeep vein thrombosis\n, which can be fatal. But MacKenzie's surgery went smoothly. Youn was able to remove more than 3 pounds of excess skin and tighten her ab muscles. After spending the night in the hospital, MacKenzie returned to Windsor with her dad.\nTwo days after surgery, MacKenzie was still in a lot of pain. Her lower half was swollen, tight and extremely uncomfortable. For a week, she had to stay completely bent over. Youn said it'll be months before the swelling goes down completely, but MacKenzie is already back at the gym. \nShe recently bought a bikini for her birthday beach trip in December. It's the first time she's felt optimistic about showing off her abs.\n\"I'm extremely glad that I had this surgery,\" MacKenzie said gleefully. \"I can finally pull off that transformation that I've wanted to do for so long.\" ", "Should you tough out pain or take painkillers?": "Should you take it? \nOn the one hand, you're hurting. Really hurting. \nBut on the other hand, you're afraid. You've heard how dangerous these prescription opioid drugs can be -- that nearly 2 million Americans either abused or became dependent on them in 2014, \naccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n (PDF).\nIn that one year alone, more than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids, \naccording to the CDC\n. \nThe should-I-take-it-or-shouldn't-I is a choice many of us will have to make. \nIn 2013, U.S. doctors wrote nearly 207 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers, \naccording to the National Institute of Drug Abuse\n, to treat everything from cancer and post-surgical pain to bone fractures and headaches. \nHere are questions you should ask your doctor -- and yourself -- before saying yes or no to your doctor's offer of a prescription for opioid painkillers. \nAm I at a high risk for becoming addicted to these painkillers? \nYou're more prone to becoming addicted to prescription painkillers if you or someone in your family has a history of substance abuse, and that includes legal and illegal drugs, alcohol and tobacco, according to Dr. Jane Ballantyne, professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the University of Washington and president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. \nYou're also at a higher risk for addiction if you have a history of a psychiatric disease, including depression or anxiety, she added. \nWill something else help my pain? \nExperts generally agree that opioid painkillers are a good choice in certain situations, such as if you're suffering from cancer pain or you've just had major surgery. \nBut on the other end of the spectrum, they say these drugs are bad choices for chronic pain, such as headaches or back pain. \nFirst, chronic pain needs a long-term solution, and your chances of becoming dependent on opioids goes up the longer you take them. \n\"After 12 weeks, you will have severe withdrawal attacks if you stop taking these drugs,\" said Dr. Gary Franklin, a research professor at the University of Washington and medical director of the Washington Department of Labor and Industries. \nSecond, he said, opioids aren't very effective in these situations. \n\"There's no evidence that these drugs actually help for these kinds of conditions, and it may actually make the pain even worse,\" he said. \nHe said there are \nbetter alternatives to opioids\n, such as Advil and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and \nother treatments\n such as physical therapy.\nHow long will I be taking these drugs? \nOpioids can be effective shorter-term, but even then, you want to get a very clear definition from your doctor about how long he or she expects you to be on them. \nOftentimes, an opioid prescription will start when something sudden happens: someone throws their back out moving furniture, for example, or they injure themselves playing sports. \nIn these types of acute situations, \nthe CDC recommends\n prescribing the drugs for just a matter of days. \n\"Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed,\" the guidelines state. \nBut that's not how many doctors prescribe these drugs. \n\"Many doctors are giving prescriptions for 15 to 30 days; that's way more than what people need,\" Franklin said. \nDr. W. Michael Hooten, a professor of anesthesiology in the division of pain medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, said he doesn't prescribe opioids at all in these types of acute situations, such as when people throw out their backs. \nHe cites \na study showing that 27% of patients\n who were prescribed the drugs on a short-term basis ended up taking them for considerably longer. \n\"These people weren't meant to be long-term users, but they ended up becoming long-term users,\" he said. \"And these aren't bad people; they're our neighbors. They're people we know and like.\" \nAre you prescribing me the lowest possible dosage? \nThe CDC guidelines emphasize that doctors should \"start low and go slow.\" \nWhat's the plan to taper me off? \nHooten suggests you ask your doctor for his or her plan if you do become dependent on these drugs. \n\"Also ask if they know how to taper someone off of drugs,\" he added. \nThe Veterans Administration \nhas more information\n (PDF) about tapering off of opioid drugs. ", "Can this app change schizophrenia treatment?": "For Rhiannon Crandall-Martin, the voices and hallucinations started during her sophomore year in high school, but they were never very extreme. \"I didn't really pay attention to them. If I saw something or heard something, I could tell myself it wasn't real.\" \nThings were fairly manageable through the rest of high school. After college, she found a job working from home, for a call center.  But the hallucinations and voices were getting more and more aggressive. \n\"There was a very small part of my brain that told me that they weren't real. But the majority of my brain said they were real. They said, 'You're not safe. Your loved ones aren't safe.' \"  \n'I'm the problem'\nCrandall-Martin remembers thinking, \"You have to protect your family from yourself, because I'm the problem.\" The paranoia sent her down a path of self-harm. \nShe's not sure exactly what happened. The details are hazy. \"One of the symptoms I have is memory loss, so I kind of lose track of time.\" \nBut in 2014, at age 21, she found herself in a psychiatric hospital.\n\"I hurt myself while I was at the hospital. I just remembered that I had bandages on my arms, and I had no idea why,\" she recalled. \"It was so stressful at the time. I couldn't differentiate reality from delusions.\"\nWith the help of medication and therapy, she was able to regain control, and she was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nCrandall-Martin was in the hospital for two months. But when she left, she broke down. \"I had no idea what I was doing. They said, 'keep our number. You'll be OK. You're doing fine.' But I didn't believe them.\" \nThe first three months out of the hospital were a struggle. She says much of the year was spent calibrating the dosages of her medications. \"I've been on so many dosages and types of medications. I've had so many side effects. But I have a combo that sort of works for me now, but I need to be recalibrated when the paranoia and the anxiety start working again.\n\"Every once in a while, I would see something. Or I would hear something, and a cold sweat comes over me. 'Oh, my God, it's happening again,' \" Crandall-Martin said. \nShe had to track her delusions: Are they getting stronger? Are they flickering by? \"It's really anxiety-inducing,\" she said of monitoring the voices and hallucinations. \nTracking the hallucinations was depressing, she said. She'd ask her doctors, \" 'Can't you just give me another med to just make them go away?' I just wanted them to stop when it would flare up.\" \nThen, while looking for new work, she came across an \nad on Craigslist\n looking for study participants. \"Feeling Unmotivated? Recently diagnosed with schizophrenia?\" it read. \"It really interested me. It definitely spoke directly to me,\" she said.\nAs part of the study, Crandall-Martin received an iPhone that was loaded with Prime, a social networking app designed to create a community for people with schizophrenia. \nDanielle Schlosser,\n a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, has worked with such people for the past decade. \"I talk to many people who say things like, 'He would go to college, he was really successful, but he's in treatment now. It's such a big deal to get him to go outside and take a walk or connect with his old friends.' \" \nBut when actually speaking to the patient, Schlosser said, she would hear something different.  \"They say they want to go outside, but it feels like a lot of effort.\" \nA new way of thinking about treatment\nSchizophrenia is a leading cause of disability in the United States: About \n3.5 million Americans\n have the disease, with most people developing it between their late teens and early 20s. The roots of the disease aren't completely understood, but it includes a genetic component. Half of all those diagnosed with the disease will never receive any treatment. \nTreatment has long focused on antipsychotic medications and on really difficult-to-treat symptoms, Schlosser said. Instead, she wanted to focus on improving people's quality of life, encouraging and inspiring those patients.\nAs head of the university's \nDigital Research and Interventions for Volitional Enhancement\n, or DRIVE, lab, she and her team saw  social networking as a potential tool to connect people who felt isolated.  \n\"Traditional methods aren't more successful because they require you to come into the therapy office for an hour, every few weeks, and then take all that information and remember it and access it at critical moments in life,\" Schlosser explained. \nInstead, the Prime app essentially puts support at the patient's fingertips, at a moment's notice. \n\"They needed to have a way to have this quick full list of education, connection, in a very brief interaction,\" she said. \nBut the team had to be careful not to appropriate Facebook, because many of Schlosser's patients said they felt uncomfortable there or felt threatened by people's happy posts. So with the help of the design firm \nIDEO\n and more patients, Schlosser and the DRIVE team came up with Prime. \nSchlosser said the contributors were instrumental to the app's success. \"I was so immersed in the science, I hadn't thought about the experience, and that was a real failure.\" Instead, they humanized Prime, thinking about it as a friend: What did they want in a friend? In a support system? \nPrime is designed much like other social networks: A patient establishes a profile, with their interests and symptoms, and gets matched to coaches and other patients who may be going through similar experiences. Patients can also add goals, such as \"go outside today\" or \"remember more positive moments.\"\nCrandall-Martin's profile included such goals as \"mop the kitchen\" or \"go to the movies on Friday.\" \n\"It's really neat when you complete a goal, it's a real pick-me-up. For some of us, it's a huge achievement,\" she said. \n\"If I had flareups, instead of rushing to my doc saying I needed new meds, I would go to the app and type in, 'I'm experiencing this, is anyone available to talk or want to talk?' And we'd just go back and forth,\" Crandall-Martin said. \nShe could immediately access a network of peers who could offer suggestions or empathize with her concerns, as well as coaches who could work with her through a difficult moment. If her assigned coach didn't have a technique that worked, she could work with another. \n\"If I was having a panic attack, I could whip out my phone and just come back to Earth, come back to reality. No need to have a panic attack. I could breathe and get through,\" she said.\nMany app users report improvement\nDuring the six-month study period when Crandall-Martin was using Prime, her anxiety medication dosage went down, she said, and she went to fewer counseling sessions.\nSchlosser and her team found that over the study period, patients had a two- or threefold increase in engagement, whether they were accessing coaches, interacting with peers or just logging on. \nThe team created a similar app for depression, Prime D. \nBy the end of the six-month Prime D study, patients reported a 50% reduction in depression severity, using the \nPHQ-9\n (PDF) scale. After the first four weeks, 75% of patients said the app had helped them meet a personal goal. By eight weeks, that number was 90%. \nNow that the Prime study is over, Crandall-Martin said she misses using the app: \"I didn't think it would have such an impact on my life. I miss having that tight-knit community.\" She said her medication dosage has increased. \nSoon, Schlosser and her team hope to publish the results of their study and to get Prime and Prime D on the market. \nShe said the work has reminded her to think of patients as people first. \"It might seem basic, but if our goal is to improve people's lives, it can't be just about treating symptoms but treating the whole person. That might look like talking to the patients about who they are and what they want instead of diving into what's wrong.\" ", "One transgender woman's long road to finding herself": "I decided to start at the beginning. \nThe early messages\n\"Congratulations, it's a boy!\" \nWith four words, my trauma began. The concept of my gender was the first thing my mother learned about me, likely only a second after hearing my first cry. When doctors speak those words, they're correct for most babies. They weren't, in my case.\nFrom my earliest memories, I received little messages that told me I was different: I didn't like getting dirty. I wanted to be inside listening to music, or with my sister and mother. I was fascinated by Barbie. But I was constantly steered outdoors, \"where boys belong.\" My parents dressed me like a boy, so I wasn't a girl, right?\nI didn't know why I was different, but whatever it was, it wasn't acceptable. I learned to fake acting like other boys so I wasn't shunned or beaten at school. I knew my thoughts and emotions resembled those I saw displayed by other girls, but I didn't have the language to explain what was different or why.\nWe moved from San Francisco to rural Missouri when I was 10, and the bullying turned to gay bashing with horrible names and frequent beatings. \nAs a preteen, I made friendships with boys I didn't know were gay. We played like girls played, pretending to be old Hollywood actresses like Ava Gardner and Audrey Hepburn. We were as fabulous as we imagined their lives had been, showing up to a Hollywood premier in a Bugatti Royale, complete with chauffeur. \nI found comfort in these friendships, but not because I was gay. I had huge crushes on girls, never once on a boy. We were bonded by our mutual \"otherness.\"\nWearing the mask of masculinity\nAs I grew older, I got better at making the \"mask of masculinity\" fit. I continually improved my public and private fa\u00e7ade, but even that created anxiety.\nI was 27 or 28 when I was first exposed to the concept of transgenderism. I think it was a PBS documentary. I didn't understand the difference between cross-dressing, drag queens and being transgender at the time.\nRead: Let transgender people achieve their American dream\nA couple of years later, I better understood the differences, but \"transgender\" still didn't quite fit. I had seen only transgender women who were attracted to men. I felt like I was the only person like me in the entire world.\nIt was another few years before I disclosed my secret to anyone. I met a lesbian who described feeling different from a young age. I shared my story, with which she identified. This chance disclosure to a stranger repeated itself a couple of times, but I still hid it from anyone close.\nBy my early 30s, I had two failed marriages and four sons. \"Are you sure you aren't gay?\" a girlfriend asked one day. I froze -- was I caught? \"Why would you think that?\" I asked. It was true that I was the one crying at the end of the movie while she sat on the other end of the couch, dry-eyed. It wasn't the only time she asked me. Women see subtle social clues that men don't, especially when they're intimately close. She knew something was different, but I still wasn't ready for honesty.\nRead: North Carolina transgender law: Is it discriminatory?\nI was 37 and working as an assignment editor at an Oklahoma TV station when I came out to a lesbian photographer at work. We became instant friends. She introduced me to her friends, and I felt like I had finally found my people! \"My girls,\" as I called them, would eventually grow from a small group of lesbians in Oklahoma to both lesbians and straight women around the world. These women loved me fiercely. With them, I could be myself, unmasked. I began experimenting with light makeup and going to lesbian bars. It was incredibly freeing to be seen as a woman, but I still wore the mask of masculinity in public.\nFor casual friends and co-workers -- the ones who saw the mask -- I was a source of negativity. I was living miserably, and just a few months after arriving at CNN in June 2013, I was ready to crack.\nI saw a doctor in the summer of 2014 because I wasn't sleeping, and was referred to a psychiatrist, and later a therapist. Up to this point, I had buried my dysphoria, terrified that acknowledging it automatically meant a transition, which meant losing my job, family and becoming homeless. I felt trapped, without options.\nRead: 'I'm not the Obamacare kid anymore'\nI'd never created a plan or attempted suicide, but I was very aware of the pills on my counter, enough of which would send me off to a never-ending slumber. According to a \n2014 study\n by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and National Center for Transgender Equality, a whopping 41% of transgender people admitted to attempting suicide. It's astronomical, compared to the 1.6% of the overall U.S. population who report a suicide attempt.\nThrough therapy, I realized that those frightening things weren't automatic, and that I really did have options. By the beginning of 2015, I took the first step. I gave myself permission, and began working on the second step, a timeline.\nComing out to family\nWhen I came out to my dad in August 2015, I was 48 and had started hormones four months before. We lost my mother in April. My sister had known for years, and we were both worried about how dad would handle the news. I began by telling him that I hoped the difficult news would bring us closer together. Fear of being a disappointment had fueled my secrecy since childhood, which had put a wall of separation between us.\nDad's response was something I never expected, but now realize I should have. I should have given him credit for all the loving things he had done for his family, all the sacrifices he had made. He told me he was shocked, but that he loves me and that wouldn't change. \"Everyone is different,\" he said. \"I know that, and I only want you to be happy.\" He instantly accepted me, without condition, and told me -- showed me -- just how much he loves me.\nMy sons, now 17, 19, 26 and 28,\n \nhave each had different reactions. What would they think it meant for them? I didn't want them to wonder if my being transgender was hereditary. Two aren't sure what to think yet, the other two are incredibly supportive. One close family member told me she didn't think she could call me Dani. Despite knowing her love for me, it stung a little.\nI don't speak to my first ex-wife. My second was shocked, but very supportive, much like my ex-girlfriends. One joked, \"That explains a lot,\" when I told her. My fear was that they would each look back on our intimacy and either be disgusted or wonder what it meant -- did this make them gay?\nComing out at work\nA few weeks later, I walked into a huddle of my co-workers and asked them to stay as their meeting came to a close. I was trembling, but reminded myself of how I'd felt before telling Dad.\nIn the middle of the main newsroom at CNN headquarters I began, \"I'm transgender and I've decided to medically transition.\" I gave them a shortened version of this story. I told them I'd decided months before to transition, and that they had probably noticed I was now less stressed and easier to be around. That brought a chuckle. It was obvious to them, how trapped and bottled-up I used to be. I told them how hormones had, and would, change me.\nI asked that on October 5 they begin using my new name and referring to me with female pronouns. I explained that I understood how difficult it is to begin thinking differently about someone else's gender, that they would make mistakes, but that there would be no scolding. That was a conscious departure from the shaming I see often on Twitter from some transgender people. While it's appropriate to have boundaries and not use a trans person's \"dead name\" or misgender them on purpose, mistakes are inevitable when you already know someone as a particular gender and name. I wanted my co-workers to see this as a positive, not as a \"gotcha\" opportunity.\nRead: Chris Mosier: The trans athlete making giant strides\nFinally, I told them that I didn't want them to feel pressured to have questions or responses right away. \"That's it. I'm just going to walk away now,\" I ended. But they stopped me, some with tears in their eyes. They immediately showed me their unconditional love with hugs, and in doing so, gave me relief, love, acceptance. Word spread throughout CNN and I began getting words of encouragement from co-workers I'd never met.\nThe road ahead\nThe same day I came out to co-workers, I paid the several hundred dollars to file a petition to change my name. As I walked out of the courthouse, I thought of the privilege I'd just experienced. Having the money to pay for a name change isn't something available to all trans folk. Many are involved in sex work and other dangerous activities in order to get hormones or even feed themselves. In a survey of 500 transgender people by the D.C. Trans Coalition, the group found that transgender people experience 10-20 times the rate of poverty, homelessness and assault as the average American.\nCurrently, I feel like a 12-year-old girl. I'm awkward and I don't \"pass\" as a woman. Half the time people \"sir\" me, half \"ma'am\" me. Some even double-take or correct themselves. Awkward!\nHormones don't make me cry any more or less, but now my emotions feel normal -- unmuted, not suppressed. My health insurance covers the cost of hormones and sex reassignment surgery, if I choose that. It doesn't cover facial feminization surgery, which some say is even more important to mental health, and even physical safety.\nRead: New York's lesson on safe bathroom access for all\nI avoid \nusing the restroom in public\n, when I can. It's a touchy subject. Many parents are concerned about their daughters using the restroom at school with a trans girl who has male anatomy. Many parents are concerned about their girls using the same restroom with an adult trans woman in public. I understand the source of the fear. We want children to be safe from danger, perceived or real, but I know of no trans woman who has ever attacked anyone in a restroom. Sadly, transgender folks get attacked, plenty.\nSo why did I do it? Why would I give up male privilege? The \ngender pay gap\n is very real. I don't want to be patronized by men. I place myself in danger by simply walking down the street or opting to use the ladies room. Public awareness of transgender individuals has risen with TV shows like the award-winning Amazon show \"Transparent\" and from Caitlyn Jenner coming out. \nYou might think the increased awareness would decrease the number of assaults against trans women, but transgender activists say assaults, especially against trans women of color, increased a whopping 62% in 2015 over the year before. Some 21 transgender people were killed in 2015, the most deadly year for transgender women since advocacy groups began keeping track. That's nearly double the 13 slain in 2014, but those numbers could be even higher.\nIn a \nreport\n from the LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, researchers said, \"These totals represent only the known victims; there may very well be countless other victims of fatal anti-transgender violence whose deaths we will never know about because police, the press or family members have consistently misidentified them based on their assigned sex and name at birth.\"\nI did it because it was either transition or lose my life. If I hadn't eventually attempted suicide, I'm sure the anxiety would have taken its toll. I did it because I no longer wanted to put on the mask of masculinity.\nThe relationships I have with my family and friends have dramatically improved. I recently told a co-worker that I used to say, \"If I died tomorrow, I would die the most fortunate and loved person I know.\" I asked her what was missing from that statement. It sounded pretty good, but there was one word missing. If I die tomorrow, I will die the most fortunate, most loved and happiest person I know.", "Prince autopsy: What examiners looked for": "It's been six weeks since Prince was found dead April 21 in the elevator at Paisley Park, his home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The Midwest Medical Examiner's Office in Ramsey, Minnesota, performed the autopsy on the 57-year-old musician \nthe very next day\n, a process officials said took only about four hours. \nForensic science-themed TV shows make what happens next look quick and easy, but results can take weeks. The full autopsy and toxicology reports will not be released, the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office tells CNN.\n\"When 'Star Trek' is real, you'll have a tricorder that can determine what happened to someone immediately, but it doesn't work that way yet,\" said \nKevin Lothridge\n, CEO of the National Forensic Science Technology Center. \"The technology is a lot faster than it used to be, but there has to be quality assurance in the lab to corroborate what you may have found in the field.\" \nIn a case like Prince's, the medical examiner's office does a routine but complicated kind of detective work that relies on reaching out to family members and doctors to gather medical history and understand what prescriptions the person was taking. The office might examine the scene of the person's death. It will send tissue samples out for lab tests, and it will want results reconfirmed. And this investigation happens in offices that typically juggle dozens of cases at once.\nIf a person is killed by something obvious such as a knife or gun, or if the person is older or has been sick with cancer, the medical examiner may determine cause of death quickly. When there are no obvious signs of trauma or suicide, the medical examination may be \nmuch more involved\n. \nIn Prince's case, the medical examiner's office decided to run a full toxicology scan. Toxicology tests are typically what takes the longest to run -- sometimes many weeks -- in a death investigation.\n\"It is a very detailed process that cannot often be done in a few hours or a few days or even a few weeks. More involved investigations can take several months,\" said \nBruce Goldberger\n, a professor and director of toxicology at the University of Florida College of Medicine. \"By now, the medical examiner probably knows or has a pretty good handle on the cause and manner of Prince's death, but you have to do all these other tests that are a part of an investigation to officially certify the cause and manner of death.\" \nWhat examiners look for\nIn an autopsy, an examiner \nwill gather a number of samples\n from a body to test. Blood will be drawn from a variety of areas. A scientist might also take gastric contents, bile, liver, hair, nails or samples from the person's eye.\nA scientist will first test a person's blood using something called an immunoassay to look for commonly used legal or illegal drugs. These initial \ntoxicology tests \ncan determine whether someone has taken something innocuous, such as allergy medicine or antidepressants, or something like opiates or amphetamines. Blood tests can also help determine whether someone died after being exposed to something in the environment, such as carbon monoxide or pesticides or some kind of heavy metal or inhalants.\nIf the tests come out positive for a drug, the lab runs further tests to make a definitive determination as to whether that particular drug caused the person's death. \nIf someone were taking an opiate, for instance, these tests can determine exactly what kind and possibly how much. If the person were using something like \nfentanyl,\n a powerful synthetic opiate that has increased in popularity and has been linked to a growing number of deaths, it can be \"an enormous challenge for the toxicology lab\" because it comes in a variety of formulations, Goldberger said. The initial lab might need to send it to a specialist, taking even more time. \nIf you've ever had to pass a drug test to get a job, you know that a lab can quickly figure out whether you've been using drugs by testing your urine. With a dead person, urine might not always be available. Even if it is, urine might not always tell a scientist what was going on at the exact time of death or at the time it was collected, since it takes time for the body to eliminate drugs through urine. \nScientists might examine liver samples since that organ helps your body metabolize most drugs and other substances, such as alcohol. Even if a toxicologist can't find the drug in a person's blood, it may turn up in the liver.\nScientists might look at stomach contents to see whether a person recently ingested a drug; undigested pills could still be in their system. They might test the vitreous humor, the clear substance in eyes, for drugs or alcohol. Drugs can also show up in hair and nail samples. \n\"I know sometimes families are anxious for results, because they are waiting for death benefits or for peace of mind, but this process is a legal, multifaceted process,\" Goldberger said. \"You want results that can be relied on and be as definitive as possible.\" ", "Inside Ellis Island's abandoned hospitals": "The island's basic history is known to every American student: Ellis Island opened in 1892 and closed its doors in 1954. More than 12 million immigrants arriving in New York were taken to Ellis Island to clear immigration checks. Most were processed and allowed into the country. Those who were thought to be sick or disabled, around 1 million in total, were sent to the massive hospital complex on the island's south side. \nEllis Island became part of the National Park Services In 1965. In 1986, renovations began on the island's main immigration building. The Ellis Island Immigration Museum opened in that building in 1990. \nThe hospital complex on the south side still stands, but it's in what John McInnes describes as \"a state of arrested decay.\" \n\"That's why we wear hard hats,\" explains McInnes, public programs manager at the nonprofit \nSave Ellis Island Foundation\n, which offers \nlimited tours\n of the historic site. The group is dedicated to the rehabilitation and preservation of the buildings on the island.  \nMcInnes stands in a \"Y\" corridor that leads to the hospital complex. \"This is actually a really important demarcation point for any immigrant who finds themselves here,\" he says in tour guide mode. \"If I go down this hallway I'll be going to the Island Hospital, built to restore the health of people suffering minor injuries, broken bones ... even babies were born in that building -- 350 babies.\" \nThe other hall took patients to the Contagious and Infectious Disease Hospital, where they were treated for deadly diseases like diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles and whooping cough. Surprisingly, the most frightening diseases were not necessarily the most likely to stop an immigrant from entering the country. If an immigrant survived diphtheria, he or she would return to the immigration process. It was the people suffering from less serious conditions -- maybe a bum knee or bad back -- who would be sent home, because they couldn't work.\n\"If you are not fit enough to enter the United States, they are going to stabilize your condition for deportation,\" McInnes says. \"The steamship company was responsible for transit and your return trip. Just know that all of the immigrants returning back to Europe would likely be returning with the freight.\"\nEllis Island's hospital complex was built with several pavilions extending off a central hall, leaving plenty of space between each one to keep patients from spreading infections. The design, aptly called \"\nPavilion Style\n,\" was developed, in part, by \nFlorence Nightingale\n. Ellis Island's hospital complex was one of the last pavilion-style hospitals built.  \n\"No two pavilions will face each other because we are concerned about cross contamination,\" McInnes explains. \"Each pavilion is going to be dedicated to a specific disease.\" \nThe patient rooms were at the back of each pavilion, as far from the hall as possible, with 14 beds placed around the perimeter of the room, near the windows.\nInitially the Contagious and Infectious Disease Hospital was separated from the main Island Hospital by a strip of water. Back then, it was wrongly believed that germs couldn't travel across water, McInnes notes. The water was eventually filled in with soil from the city of New York, creating a grassy area where patients could stroll. \n\"It was working with the germ theory of the day,\" McInnes says.  \"Fresh air and sunlight were an important part of the curative process. There were a lot of times that was all we had to offer.\" \nThe complex also has isolation wards, which are at the end of the island closest to the Statue of Liberty. Patients in the isolation wards were kept 12 to a room, and could be sealed in for weeks, along with nursing staff, if serious outbreaks occurred.\n\"It would be a frightening place to work if \ncholera\n were to break out.\"\nMost doctors and nurses who worked in the hospital at Ellis Island lived there as well. \nNurses lived in dormitories above the rooms where patients were treated; the pharmacist mixed and dispensed medications from his house. The top two medical officers on the island, the chief of surgery and the chief of psychiatric, lived with their families in apartments connected to the end of the hospital complex.  \nA kitchen in the hospital complex cooked 1,500 meals a day, plus provided cold milk and biscuits for the women and children twice daily.  \n\"It is where people got their first enculturation of America,\" McInnes says. He likes to tell the story of the immigrant who said, \"My first meal was worms covered with blood.\" \n\"What was he eating? Spaghetti.\"\nThe laundry room cleaned 3,000 pieces of hospital linens a day in giant commercial washing machines with names like \"The Fletcher Whirlwind,\" which look more like components from Jules Verne's submarines than a modern-day Maytag.  \nMen did the washing and drying at Ellis Island, McInnes says. The women did the ironing and folding. \nKeeping the mattresses clean was another challenge. A machine called the \"mattress autoclave\" steam boiled contaminated mattresses to kill bacteria. \nSafety procedures appear to have at least partially worked to protect staff. Though approximately 3,500 people died on Ellis Island, that included no staff members who contracted diseases from their patients, McInnes says. \nTremendous work has gone into stabilizing the hospital buildings and stopping their deterioration, but more work needs to be done. In one hallway, the doors and windows are gone; they're covered with poison ivy vines. Trees poke through, allowing the rain in. The water is only expediting the decaying process. In the hall, chimney bricks that fell down during Superstorm Sandy lie stacked on wooden pallets in hopes of being put to use in a future restoration.  \nSave Ellis Island offers \nlimited hard hat tours\n of the hospital complex for $25 a person. An exhibition by artist JR is on display throughout the hospital complex. The proceeds from the tours go toward maintaining and restoring the hospital complex.  \n\"It takes a lot of money to do anything, from mowing the grass to even returning artifacts to the south side of the island,\" McInnes says.\nHe estimates a complete restoration of the south side of the island would cost about half a billion dollars, a price tag that grows every year.  ", "What gun violence victims can learn from Big Tobacco": "At issue are what the families allege are the manufacturer's marketing strategies and other trade secrets on military-style weapons.\nAlthough the trial is \nnot set to begin until April 2018\n, the case is moving closer to discovery, the pretrial process that allows each party access to internal documents from the other side. \nSome experts believe the discovery process could yield the type of incriminating internal information unearthed during landmark litigation against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\nDuring that litigation, the discovery process unearthed much of the damaging internal information that forced Big Tobacco into \nmassive settlements\n.  \n\"A successful suit that would have a similar level of discovery in this kind of litigation would be ... of historic proportions,\" said Dr. Richard Hurt, a Mayo Clinic internal medicine specialist who was a key witness in a 1994 \nMinnesota suit against the tobacco industry\n.\n\"The gun manufacturers know more about their product than anybody else on the planet.\"\nLike gun manufacturers today, the tobacco industry was once legally impregnable. In the case of the gun industry, that's because a federal law gives gun businesses general protections from civil lawsuits.\nThe\n Sandy Hook families\n hope to shatter that armor with allegations that the gun maker deliberately marketed a risky military-style weapon to civilians, specifically young men.\nWhat's the Sandy Hook lawsuit about?\nThe families are suing the Remington Arms Co., manufacturer of the type of gun used in the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.\nIn addition to monetary and punitive damages, the plaintiffs want the Bushmaster AR-15 -- the type of semiautomatic rifle used in the attack -- removed from the civilian market.\nCiting a string of mass shootings involving semiautomatic rifles, the Sandy Hook families argue that the \"AR-15 is the weapon of choice for shooters looking to inflict maximum casualties, and American schools are on the forefront of such violence,\" according to \ncourt documents\n. \nThe suit claims the gun manufacturer was reckless in selling a weapon \"with no conceivable use ... other than the mass killing of other human beings\" and \"unscrupulously marketed and promoted the assaultive qualities and military uses of AR-15s to a demographic of young civilians.\" \nThe suit was filed last year by nine of the 26 victims' families and Natalie Hammond, a vice principal who was shot and survived. They are demanding that Bushmaster and its owner, Remington, turn over documents about firearm safety and sales practices.\nThe troubled 20-year-old Lanza embarked on his killing spree with a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle and 10 30-round magazines. His mother, Nancy, had legally purchased the weapon. She was shot and killed at home by Lanza before the school slaughter.\nIn less than five minutes, Lanza unloaded 154 rounds at Sandy Hook, according to court documents.\n\"Each of the kids had three to eight bullets in them,\" said Jackie Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was one of the children shot and killed at the school. \"There is just something wrong if that can happen.\"\nThe semiautomatic rifle unleashes a barrage of bullets within seconds, without the need to reload often, according to the complaint. \"The net effect is more wounds, of greater severity, in more victims, in less time,\" reads the complaint.\n\"Remington took a weapon that was made to the specs of the U.S. military for the purpose of killing enemy soldiers in combat -- and that weapon in the military is cared for with (a) tremendous amount of diligence, in terms of training, storage, who gets the weapon and who can use it,\" said attorney Josh Koskoff, a representative for the families of Sandy Hook victims. \"They took that same weapon and started peddling it to the civilian market for the purposes of making a lot of money.\"\nRemington has declined to comment to CNN on the pending litigation. However, in a court filing, an attorney for Remington blamed the massacre on the shooter: \"Adam Lanza's criminal actions were the sole proximate cause of the deaths and injuries he inflicted.\"\nRemington attorney Scott Harrington, in seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, argued that the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act grants gun manufacturers immunity from any lawsuit related to injuries that result from criminal misuse of their product.\nPrevious lawsuits against the gun industry\nLawsuits against gun makers were inspired by class-action lawsuits against manufacturers of products such as asbestos, Agent Orange, silicone breast implants and tobacco, according to Georgia State University law professor Timothy Lytton.\nInjury victims, advocacy groups and attorneys began filing claims against product manufacturers in the 1960s in response to public health problems, said Lytton, an expert in gun cases. In the 1980s, claims against gun makers began to paint the violence as a public health issue.\n\"The value of gun litigation was that it reframed the issue ... from a problem of street crime or mass shootings to a problem of industry distribution and marketing practices,\" Lytton said.\nGroups such as the \nNational Shooting Sports Foundation\n -- the firearms industry's trade association, based in Newtown -- have long maintained that the criminal misuse of guns is a criminal justice issue, not a public health one.\nU.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, however, has called gun violence a major public health issue. According to the FBI, rifles (including semi-automatics such as the AR-15), are linked to about 300 deaths in the U.S. each year, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 33,636 overall firearms deaths in 2013. \nSince the 1980s, gun victims and dozens of municipalities have filed claims against dealers and manufacturers, seeking to recover gun violence-related costs for law enforcement and emergency medical services.\nIn 2000, Smith & Wesson, the nation's leading gun manufacturer, agreed to what government officials called a \"historic\" legal settlement in which the company agreed to make several changes in its gun marketing, manufacturing and design practices. The settlement was widely criticized within the industry; the gun maker faced a boycott from gun buyers and took a major financial hit.\nLast year, a civil court jury in Milwaukee \nawarded about $5 million in damages\n after finding a gun shop negligent for illegally selling a pistol to a man who shot two police officers. The two sides later agreed on a $1 million settlement. \nThe suit was only the second of its kind to reach a jury since the \n2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act\n, according to experts.\nGun manufacturers' protection from liability\nThat act came in response to a spate of suits accusing manufacturers of not doing enough to ensure safe distribution of guns or prevent the flow of guns onto the black market. The rationale was that manufacturers and dealers who follow the law should not be held accountable for the actions of criminals.\nThe controversial 2005 law and gun control have been contentious topics in this year's Democratic presidential race, with \nHillary Clinton attacking Bernie Sanders\n for his Senate vote in favor of the law.\nIn March, during CNN's Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan, the candidates sparred over the Sandy Hook lawsuit.\nSanders said gun manufacturers are not legally liable.\n\"If they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you're really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America,\" he said. \"I don't agree with that.\"\nClinton responded, \"No other industry in America has absolute immunity.\"\nIn a statement, the National Shooting Sports Foundation called out Clinton, saying the law allows lawsuits for \"knowing violations of federal or state law related to gun sales, or on traditional grounds, including negligent entrustment or breach of contract.\" The act also permits product liability cases involving injuries from defective firearms.\n\"Without the protection against junk lawsuits, such as the PLCAA provides to our industry members, many of America's most critical industries would go out of business from the time and costs of frivolous lawsuits,\" the statement said.\n\"Industries cannot and should not be held legally responsible for the wrong-doings of individuals who purchase their products legally and then proceed to use them illegally.\"\nBut Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said the law affords gun makers an almost exclusive degree of legal protection.\n\"Litigation has potential to serve more than one purpose: compensating victims but also a potential to serve a more societal purpose, a public health purpose to get information out and provide manufacturers with an incentive to either design or market their products more safely,\" he said.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act changes the playing field, Vernick said.\n\"The tobacco industry did not enjoy this kind of immunity from having a lawsuit even go forward. It's one thing to say that a case is hard to win, as the tobacco litigation was. It's another to say that it can't even be brought at all,\" he said.\nParallels between gun and tobacco litigation\nThe landmark 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement followed decades of failed litigation.\n\"If you sued them for $1 million, they were prepared to spend $20 million to defeat your million-dollar claim in order that the message would go out from coast to coast that there's no point in suing them,\" said Doug Blanke, founder and director of the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Minnesota.\nA group of 46 states reached an agreement with leading tobacco companies that called for manufacturers to pay the states $206 billion and submit to sweeping advertising and marketing restrictions.\nFour other states -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas -- negotiated separate settlements with cigarette makers.\nThe cases represented the five largest settlements in the history of litigation.\nUntil the tobacco settlements, the cigarette was largely exempt from government regulation, Blanke said. \nHe and others pointed out how, since Sandy Hook, Congress has rejected additional money to fund research into gun violence. They see it as a sign of the strength of the gun lobby in the United States. \n\"Gun manufacturers stand in a position that has some similarity to where tobacco manufacturers used to be,\" said Blanke, who was involved in the tobacco litigation as an assistant attorney general in Minnesota.\n\"They've got enough influence that they've been able to create special rules just for themselves that give them a unique kind of immunity or shelter from the accountability.\n\"If facts were to come out, hypothetically, in which the gun companies were shown to have been as cynical and as manipulative and as intentional behind their closed doors as the cigarette manufacturers were, then in the long run, I think public attitudes will shift and society will insist that these companies play by the same rules as every other business,\" Blanke said.\nThe National Rifle Association, the nation's leading gun rights organization and a top lobbying group, did not respond to requests for comment.\nHow gun manufacturers are not like cigarette makers\nLawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, dismissed the comparison to tobacco litigation as \"an old and invalid analogy.\"\n\"Tobacco, when used as intended, causes harm to the user,\" he said via email. \"Firearms, when used as intended, save lives. The lawful commerce in firearms is constitutionally protected. Tobacco is not.\"\nKeane said the gun industry has survived years of \"costly, vexatious litigation\" filed by gun control attorneys and tobacco trial lawyers who modeled their suits on earlier legal strategies.\n\"In several cases ... these plaintiffs' lawyers took extensive discovery searching for those very internal documents of alleged 'industry secrets' about gun design and marketing,\" he said.\n\"They took dozens and dozens of depositions of all of the major manufacturers and received a warehouse full of documents. ... Not a single case was successful. So no, there is no comparison to the tobacco litigation.\"\nIn the Big Tobacco cases, settlements were reached during a decades-long national transformation toward lower tolerance for smoking, according to Lytton. That's not happening with gun control.\n\"You have people who are increasingly stuck in their positions who are basically suspicious of any additional controls on the sales of firearms, and you have people who are increasingly zealous about trying to shut down access to firearms,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a stalemate, and that stalemate is reflected in Congress.\"\nUnlike smoking, the causes of gun violence and strategies to prevent it have not been extensively studied by public health authorities.\nA 2015 CNN investigation showed that the nation's leading public health official, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden, had never -- during his six years on the job -- talked publicly about gun violence, which kills more people in the U.S. each year than AIDS, colon cancer or prostate cancer. \nFrieden declined to comment for the report, but his defenders say he's being wise. They say that if he dares to publicly talk about lives lost to guns, Congress might retaliate by taking away CDC funding for a whole host of safety issues. That, they say, is the strength of the gun lobby.\nAs the case involving Sandy Hook victims and Remington moves forward, there is much at stake in one of the most divisive debates in the country.\n\"The Sandy Hook lawsuit -- win, lose or draw -- has drawn increasing attention to the gun industry's marketing, sales and distribution practices as part of the issue of gun violence,\" Lytton said.", "Want better sleep, better mood, and better sex? Cut calories": "A secret to all these things -- at least according to one \nnew study\n -- is calorie restriction.\nResearchers at the \nPennington Biomedical Research Center\n in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, recruited more than 200 healthy women and men between the ages of 20 and 50. Each had a \nbody mass index\n between 22.0 and 28.0, making them either normal weight or overweight, but not obese.\nThe scientists behind this research, led by \nCorby Martin\n of Pennington's \nIngestive Behavior Laboratory\n, separated the participants into two groups for the two-year study: one that would be bound to a diet that restricted calories by 25%, and a control group whose members could continue to eat whatever they wanted.\nAfter two years, adults on the calorie-restricted diet reported better moods, less stress, increased sex drive and better sleep, compared to the adults who didn't cut their calories.\nThe authors believe this is the first study to determine whether long-term calorie restriction in normal-weight individuals affects both physical and psychological well-being.\n\"Calorie restrictions had some favorable effects on the outcomes, and weight loss was associated with improvement in many of the end points,\" the authors said.\nMembers of the calorie-restricted group lost 16.8 pounds on average, and there was virtually no weight change among control group participants. Although the calorie restriction goal was 25% for the trial group, the average actually achieved was 11.9% -- not even half of the goal. It's unclear whether the benefits would be greater with more extreme calorie restriction, or if negative outcomes would start to outweigh the positives. In the past, concerns have been raised about the potential negative effects of calorie restriction, namely due to malnutrition or lack of essential nutrients.\nMartin said it was impossible to quantify whether the effects were related specifically to calorie restriction or weight loss in general.\n\"The key message from our study is that achieving about a 12% calorie restriction over two years and losing 10% of your body weight resulted in positive effects on mood, quality of life and sexual function,\" Martin said in an email to CNN.\nOne anomaly was that men in the control group, who consumed more calories, reported higher levels of sexual arousal than the calorie-restricted men. But when it came to measuring overall quality of sex, researchers also considered sexual cognition and fantasy, sexual behavior and experience, orgasm and sex drive and relationships. All things considered, the calorie-restricted group scored higher.\nThere are some limitations on the study. Almost three-quarters of the people in the study were female and more than three-quarters were white, so it's tough to generalize the results to a broader population. The participants also self-reported the quality of their moods, sleep and sex.", "Firing up the grill? Look for this on the label of your steak": "This means the beef has been punctured with blades or needles to break down the muscle fibers and make it easier to chew. But it also means the meat has a greater chance of being contaminated and making you sick.\nOpinion: Climate change: Why beef is the new SUV\nThe labels are a requirement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that went into effect on May 17.\n\"Blade tenderized,\" that label might read, followed by \nsafe cooking instructions\n: \"Cook until steak reaches an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F as measured by a food thermometer and allow to rest for 3 minutes.\"\nHere's how it can make you sick: If pathogens like E. coli or salmonella happen to be on the surface of the steak, tenderizing transfers those bacteria from the surface to the inside. Since the inside takes longer to cook and is more likely to be undercooked, bacteria have a higher chance for survival there.\nAnd without a label, you can't tell if you need to be especially careful with your steak.\nWhat does the world's most expensive meat taste like?\n\"It doesn't look any different,\" said a spokesperson for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. \"It's not filled with holes from the needle piercings.\"\nMechanical tenderizing is not an unusual occurrence. FSIS estimates that 2.7 billion pounds or about 11 percent of the beef labeled for sale has been mechanically tenderized. The new labels will affect an estimated 6.2 billion servings of steaks and roasts every year, according to FSIS.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tracked six outbreaks of foodborne illness since 2000 that were attributable to mechanically tenderized beef products prepared in restaurants and consumers' homes.\nIn 2009, 21 people in 16 states were infected with the most common strain of dangerous E. coli called O157. Nine had to be hospitalized, and one victim developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially fatal kidney disease. USDA food safety officials connected the illnesses to blade-tenderized steaks from \nNational Steak and Poultry\n, and the company \nrecalled\n 248,000 pounds of beef products.\n\"We need to improve how we tell consumers and the food service workers about the particular risks that would be involved in cooking it so that they can reduce the risk of illness,\" said Patricia Buck, co-founder and executive director of the \nCenter for Foodborne Illness Research & Prevention\n, a nonprofit advocacy group.\nBuck, who has been pushing for the labeling rule since 2009 said she's \"very excited\" to see it happening. \"I think it's an important step in the direction we need to go.\"\nThe National Cattlemen's Beef Association \"worked closely\" with USDA on the label, said spokesman Chase Adams. \"We will continue to work with them to provide helpful guidance for our members.\"\nBefore the label became a requirement, Costco had been voluntarily labeling its meat. According to Consumer Reports, the grocery giant began labeling its mechanically tenderized beef in 2012 after an E. coli outbreak in Canada was linked to their blade-tenderized steaks.\nConsumer advocate Buck lost her toddler grandson to an E. coli O157 infection in 2001. \"I don't like scaring people,\" she said, \"but on the other hand, people don't really know that these can be really deadly pathogens.\"", "U.S. Army wants you to eat MREs for 21 days straight": "If so, Uncle Sam wants you to participate in a research study.\nThe U.S. Army Institute of Environmental Medicine is \nlooking for volunteers\n (PDF) to eat military food rations for 21 consecutive days for a study of the impact of \nMeals, Ready-to-Eat, or MREs\n, on gut health. Researchers want to learn how MREs influence the millions of bacteria in troops' digestive systems.\n\"Interactions between the millions of bacteria living in our gut and what we eat is a very important factor in gut health, but we don't know how MRE foods interact with those bacteria to impact gut health,\" Holly McClung, a research dietitian working on the project, said \non the Army's website\n. \"Ultimately, discovering how eating MREs influences gut bacteria and gut health will help our efforts to continually improve the MRE.\"\nMuch like on the battlefield, one of the main obstacles in the study is finding people to commit to a steady diet of ready-to-eat meals. MREs are generally regarded as tasteless, if not bad, which is perhaps understandable considering the wide \nbattery of requirements\n they must meet to guarantee shelf life and meet strict nutritional benchmarks. \nMREs must be capable of withstanding parachute drops from 1,250 feet, and the packaging is required to maintain a minimum shelf life of 3\u00bd years at 80 degrees Fahrenheit or nine months at 100 degrees.\n\"What is nutrition if you don't consume the food?\" McClung asked. \"We need ways to keep warfighters interested in and excited about eating in the field after they have been training and eating MREs for several days.\"\nTo entice volunteers, Army dietitians created \"MRE Recipes: A collection of recipes bringing a creative twist to your MRE experience.\" \nThe cookbook features combinations of the limited ingredients available for MREs. Mountaineer mousse dip is made up of a pudding pouch, a dairy shake and water mixed to a mousse-type consistency, McClung said. Dip pretzels in it, and you might have something approximating the sweet and savory experience of salted caramel gelato.\nThe hope is that the concoctions cooked up in the study will translate to culinary inspiration on the battlefield.\n\"We want to benefit the warfighter in as many ways nutritionally and physiologically as possible,\" research dietitian Adrienne Hatch said. \"We hope that the ideas offered in this book help entice Soldiers to eat the foods needed to sustain health and energy in the field and ultimately benefit them as they carry out their missions.\"\nComplete coverage on the U.S. military", "How dangerous is Fentanyl?": "", "Baby with Zika-related microcephaly born at New Jersey hospital": "\"The mother is stable, obviously sad, which is the normal emotional reaction given the situation,\" said Dr. Abdulla Al-Khan, director of maternal and fetal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center. \nThe mother \nis visiting the United States\n from Honduras and does not want to be identified. \nThis is the second known case of a baby born with Zika-related birth defects in the United States. The first baby was \nborn in Hawaii\n. \nDoctors first examined the mother when she came to the medical center Friday. Ultrasound screening revealed the baby had \"significant microcephaly,\" he said. Babies with microcephaly have small brains and heads. \nThe baby also had calcification and dilated ventricles in the brain, according to Al-Khan. \nTests were done to rule out other causes of these abnormalities. \n\"When I saw her today, I was pretty much convinced \nthis was a Zika-affected baby,\n\" he said. \nCDC confirmation\nThe mother, who has relatives in New Jersey, traveled to the United States from Honduras in hopes of receiving better medical care because she knew her baby may have Zika-related problems, according to Al-Khan.\nDoctors believe she was infected during the second trimester of her pregnancy. She experienced a fever and rash, both symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease, which is known to cause the devastating birth defect microcephaly and other neurological disorders.\n \"When she developed the symptoms, she was seen by an OBGYN who suspected the baby was growth restricted,\" he said. \nDoctors there coordinated with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test the woman for the Zika virus. \nThe samples were sent to the CDC and results confirming the diagnosis of the virus came back Tuesday, according to Al-Khan. However, he said, that was not a factor in the mother undergoing a cesarean section to deliver.  \nClose to due date\nThe mother was close to full-term in her pregnancy. \n\"There were a few reasons the baby needed to be delivered today, including low amniotic fluid,\" he said.\n Al-Khan said such babies have \"tremendous neurological problems,\" and most don't do well.  \nThere are more than 300 pregnant women with the virus in the United States and its territories who are being followed as part of \na national registry\n.\nInformation on the outcomes or stages of these pregnancies has not been released. In February, the CDC released a report detailing the first nine  pregnancies among Zika-infected women in the United States. \nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled Dr. Abdulla Al-Khan's name.", "Olympic gymnast Simone Biles' lessons from Mom": "Biles, the three-time U.S. and world all-around gold medalist in gymnastics, is the clear favorite to bring home gold in Rio, but the 19-year-old's champion status also means mountains of pressure and expectations.\nThat's where her mom comes in.\n\"I think the key is to stay grounded and focused on training and doing your best,\" Nellie Biles of Spring, Texas, wrote in an email. \"I always tell her she is strong and exudes a unique power which will take her far in life.\"\nNellie Biles is married to Ron Biles, Simone's grandfather. He and Nellie took in Simone and her younger sister, Adria, and then formally adopted them when Simone was just 6 because Simone's mom was battling addiction to drugs and alcohol. Though Simone speaks to her biological mother and sees her from time to time, she recognizes Nellie as her mother.\nAsked specifically about Nellie, whom she calls Mom, Simone said she has always been there for her.\n \n\"She encourages me and never lets me feel down about something for too long,\" she wrote in an email. \"If I've had a bad day in the gym or needed emotional support, she was always there.\"\nThat is a message Biles is relaying as part of her work with Procter & Gamble's \"Thank You, Mom\" campaign, which is the company's focus on the mothers behind Olympic athletes and the roles they play in helping their children realize their dreams.\nEvery Olympics, the campaign includes a tug-on-the-heartstrings video that brings tears to the eyes of even the most cynical viewer. During the 2012 and 2014 Games, the videos became some of the most widely viewed of the Olympics. \nThis year is likely to be no different. \nThe video titled \"Strong,\"\n edgier than \"Thank You, Mom\" videos from Olympics past, showcases four mothers as they face life-changing challenges, including a car crash and a tornado, and how the strength they find to keep going on becomes a defining moment for their children on their path to victory.\nThe ad struck a chord with Biles, a 4-foot-9-inch phenom.\n \"The film reminded me to fully appreciate my mom and the strength she provides me through her unconditional love and support,\" she said. \"She always told me that although I am small, that doesn't limit my power or define me. For me, I don't think about size -- I focus more on being powerful and confident.\"\nStrength is a concept that most mothers might not think about every day, but it's becoming more important than ever in modern motherhood, according to a survey of 14,000 moms by P&G, the first report of its kind conducted as part of the \"Thank You, Mom\" campaign.\nNearly 75% of moms in the United States said motherhood is more complex today than it was in the past, and just about every mom surveyed admitted that they did not anticipate the demands of motherhood, according to the report. Almost two-thirds said they needed to develop greater emotional strength once they became a mom.\n\"I agree, but at the same time, I think the deeper strength develops naturally and you don't even realize you have it until one moment you look back and you realize you did a good job,\" Nellie Biles said. \"It's hard to explain, really.\"\nShe said her focus between now and Rio is doing anything Simone needs while helping her stay calm and \"take it day by day\" as she moves closer to her Olympic dream. \n\"My job is mainly support and to help keep her focused, relaxed and grounded,\" Nellie Biles said. \"She has it together. I am so proud of her.\"\nThe fact that the Olympics are now just 100 days away \"hasn't quite sunk in yet,\" Simone Biles said.

", "Could wearable 'artificial kidney' change dialysis?": "For patients with kidney failure, the common treatment is to be hooked up to a dialysis machine at a hospital or clinic several times a week. In addition to the inconvenience, patients develop buildup of fluids and minerals between dialysis sessions, which can result in high blood pressure and breathing problems and require severe dietary restrictions.\n\"I was very frustrated -- I still am -- because for decades, we've been doing dialysis with big machines that prolong the life of the patient a little bit ... and in addition, they have a lousy quality of life,\" said Victor Gura, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nGura and his colleagues are developing the \nWearable Artificial Kidney, or WAK\n, which would filter a patient's blood continuously, instead of a few times a week. \"This is to reduce a lot of the complications that make patients sick ... (and) to give patients back their life,\" such as allowing them to have jobs again, he said. \nThe researchers presented the results of a small trial of the device on Saturday at Kidney Week, the annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology. The trial involved seven patients in Seattle with end-stage kidney disease who wore the device for 24 hours. During that time, the device removed water and salts from the blood at the same rate as healthy kidneys, and patients did not complain of discomfort or experience side effects, Gura said. \nNew rules give hope to people waiting for donated kidneys\nThe current research has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal and should be considered preliminary; however, Gura and his colleagues have previously published studies of \npatients wearing WAK devices for up to eight hours\n. \nParticipants in the current and previous trials were able to sleep with the devices, and should be able to take showers and carry out other normal activities, Gura said.\n\"We encouraged patients to eat bananas and mashed potatoes and drink orange juice, (and) they enjoyed ice cream and cheesecake, which they couldn't before,\" Gura said. Normally, these foods would be off-limits because they can lead to a dangerous buildup of potassium and phosphorus between dialysis sessions.\nHowever, the device had one important pitfall: Two of the seven patients stopped wearing it before the 24 hours were up because it stopped working properly. Gura and his colleagues are working to correct technical problems before they start their next trial, which will probably involve a group of patients wearing the device for a week. \n\"Getting the machine to be reliable and consistent is going to be (Gura's) greatest challenge. ... I'll be convinced when they can keep patients stable for seven or 14 days,\" said Leslie Spry, medical director for the Dialysis Center of Lincoln in Lincoln, Nebraska, and spokeswoman for the National Kidney Foundation, a patient advocacy organization. \nThe WAK device weighs 10 pounds, though Gura and his colleagues are working to get it down to 5 pounds, and patients in the study wore them on their belts. The device connects to a large vein in the body via a catheter and, similar to a conventional dialysis machine, contains filters that separate water, salts and minerals out of the blood. \nUsers would have to remove the WAK from the catheter once a week to replace the filter and add chemicals once per day to purify the water that is filtered out. Other than those steps, the device would take care of itself, running on 9-volt batteries.\n\"Anytime you maintain a connection with a machine to your blood vessel system, infection is going to be your No. 1 enemy,\" Spry said, adding that he will be interested to see whether patients in longer-lasting trials develop infections. However, it would be \"very possible\" to teach patients to maintain their devices properly, just as those with home dialysis machines do, he added.\nHome dialysis machines have alleviated some of the burden of treatment, allowing patients to receive dialysis up to seven days a week, Spry said. He has helped develop these machines and is a part-time employee of Nx Stage, which makes dialysis machines. However, these machines do not allow continuous dialysis, and patients use them for only up to eight hours a day (in the case of nocturnal machines), he added. \nAlthough\n other wearable dialysis devices have been researched over the years\n, the WAK is the only one for which there are published clinical trials, Gura said. \nIf the researchers continue to receive funding to conduct clinical trials and further develop the technology, Gura estimates that WAK devices could be available for patients in two years. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced last month that it would expedite the approval of the device once studies are able to demonstrate safety and efficacy.", "Zero gravity weighs heavy on your health": "This research has ensured that astronauts could safely walk on the moon and live for more than a year on the International Space Station, 220 miles above the Earth's surface. But the Human Research Program, which aims to lessen the effects of the space environment on the health and performance of humans, is using the data to make sure they can send astronauts even deeper into the solar system.\nA six-month journey to Mars would only be the beginning of a challenging expedition to land people on the surface of the Red Planet, 140 million miles away. The crew members would then live and work there.\nIn preparation, NASA has been using six-month crew member rotations and Scott Kelly's groundbreaking one-year mission on the ISS to study the effects of space on the human body. So what happens when we have to transition from walking on solid ground to floating in zero gravity?\n\"I felt like I was falling,\" NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins told CNN's Rachel Crane. \"It was as if you're hanging off the rafters in a building and you let go, and that lasted for about 24 hours. My brain was taking a little while to get used to the fact that there was no up and down anymore. And that went away fairly quick. It takes a little while to get used to floating, too. It's almost like learning to walk all over again, a little bit.\"\nHopkins was on the ISS for 166 days, from September 2013 to March 2014. Though the adjustment to microgravity doesn't take long, other issues arise within the first few days due to a phenomenon in which the head tilts downward\n \nbetween 12 and 20 degrees, which causes disorientation.  \n\"As soon as you arrive in weightlessness, the fluids start shifting in your body from the lower part of your body into the upper part of your body,\" said  Dr. John Charles, Human Research Program associate manager for international science. \"Your organs of balance and your inner ear immediately sense there's no gravity pulling down on them anymore.\"\nThis causes something known among astronauts as Bird Leg Syndrome, because the fluid shift causes them to have puffy faces and thin legs. It also makes them less thirsty, dulls their sense of taste and causes a \"stuffy nose\" feeling similar to allergies. Space motion sickness also affects about 79% of astronauts who experience microgravity in the first 24 to 48 hours, creating a loss of appetite, dizziness and vomiting. \nLong-term risks\nHopkins also had to worry about the long-term effects on his body, such as the weakening and loss of bones and atrophying muscles. In space, without gravity, bones lose more than 1% of minerals and density per month. \nAstronauts also experience blood volume loss, weakened immune systems and cardiovascular deconditioning since floating takes little effort and the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood through your body, according to Human Research Program deputy chief scientist Jennifer A. Fogarty.  \nNASA has developed countermeasures to combat these known issues and how they might continue after landing back on Earth. Most involve making sure that astronauts stay healthy by consuming enough nutrients in their meals and supplements, in addition to using three\n \nspecially designed exercise machines on the ISS. \nAs soon as they overcome motion sickness, NASA wants its astronauts to start working out. It's also good for their sensory motor systems if their feet are striking the surface of something, like running on a treadmill, Fogarty said.\nThe three exercise machines\n \nmimic a treadmill, a stationary bike and a multipurpose weight machine. They're meant to stimulate the lower body, from running to squats and dead lifts, as the largest percent of bone loss occurs in the pelvis and femurs. Astronauts use the machines for two hours a day to compensate for the other 22 hours in which they aren't experiencing physical activity. \nIn addition to counteracting bone loss and atrophying muscles, the exercise provides a change of pace and mental release -- even if they have to bungee themselves to the treadmill to run in microgravity. \nBut one of the more recent effects of spaceflight noticed over the past five to seven years centers on eye health.  Kelly and other astronauts in their late 40s and 50s have complained about their vision being slightly altered. Some of them have required glasses in flight.\n\"It changes their visual acuity,\" Charles said. \"They're not able to see things up close. It's like advanced aging. That sort of thing happens at a sort of an accelerated rate.\"\nGiven the connection between the eye, optic nerve and brain, combined with the fluid shift astronauts experience, some research has suggested that the eyes act as a pressure release valve, Fogarty said. But her program has many studies in the works to get to the root of the cause and how to counteract it.\nEven though the ISS sits within Earth's protective magnetic field, astronauts are still exposed to 10 times the radiation that they would be on the ground. NASA monitors radiation exposure, given the fact that ISS crewmembers are considered radiation workers. \nThe agency has been able to limit radiation risks to 1%, but a mission to Mars would expose astronauts to harmful galactic cosmic rays. Without proper shielding, this can increase cancer risk, cause radiation sickness, alter cognitive and motor function, and even lead to cataracts and cardiac and circulatory diseases. \nThe reality of gravity\nAnd then there's landing on the ground again after experiencing zero gravity. Mars mission crew members would need to be able to get to work almost immediately after landing. Even though Mars has only a third of the gravity experienced on Earth, it would still be an adjustment for astronauts after floating for six months.\n\"[It] took a little bit longer to get used to life in gravity again,\" Hopkins said. \"I had some issues with, like, pitching moments. It just felt like if I bent [over], I would fall right on my face. And in microgravity, you lose references to how much things weigh. And so I remember when I first landed and I was laying in the Soyuz [the capsule used for landing] and I was just handing out our flight procedures. And that little book that maybe weighs a pound and a half felt like it weighed 25 or 30 pounds.\" \nBut even though our bodies weren't meant to live in space, the Human Research Program is always researching ways for us to thrive in the final frontier. The current countermeasures used on the ISS, the results of ongoing studies and recently funded proposals aiming to solve issues around human health, will aid astronauts as they push the limits of deep space in the 2020s and 2030s.\n\"Mother Nature always tells you the right answer, but you just have to ask the right question,\" Charles said. \"Our human bodies are up to the challenge of a trip to Mars and back.\"", "Therapists discriminate against black and poor patients, study finds": "A new study finds that these groups face yet another barrier to mental health care: Therapists may be less likely to see them.\nTo study whether therapists had biases, researchers hired actors to record voice messages for 640 therapists in New York. In all the messages, the actors read scripts saying they had been feeling down, had insurance and would like to make an appointment. \nThe scripts varied the names, vocabulary and grammar to reflect race and class differences. For example, the name Amy Roberts was supposed to indicate that the caller was a white middle-class woman, whereas Latoya Johnson was used for a black middle-class woman. The scripts for working-class individuals used more slang and some grammatical errors.\nThe researchers waited one week for the therapists to return the calls, which went to a voice mailbox created for the study. The researchers recorded whether the therapists agreed to see the new client and whether they could accommodate the desired time, which was a weekday evening.\nMiddle-class black women and men were about 30% and 60% less likely, respectively, than their white middle-class counterparts to hear back from a therapist agreeing to see them.  Working-class individuals fared even worse: Women and men, regardless of race, were about 70% and 80% less likely, respectively, to get an appointment, compared with white middle-class individuals.\n\"Psychotherapists are not immune to the same stereotypes that we all have, and I think they could become even more relevant for psychotherapists than for other professions [both medical and nonmedical], because they are embarking on this intimate, potentially long-term relationship with these [clients],\" said Heather Kugelmass, a doctoral student in sociology at Princeton University. Kugelmass is the author of \nthe study\n (PDF), which was published Wednesday in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior.\nA large survey in 2015 found that \n40% of physicians\n in the United States had biases about their patients, most commonly because of their emotional problems and weight, but income level and race were also on the list. \nResearch\n suggests that these biases affect the quality of care that patients receive. Although \nstudies\n also suggest that biases could prevent primary care doctors from accepting patients, no one had explored the effect of stereotypes on therapists' willingness to see patients.\nThe current study found that therapists' response rate was low in general, with only 44% returning the call. In many cases, the therapist left a message saying he or she did not have availability: Only 15% of inquiries resulted in a therapist offering an appointment time. \nTherapists were less likely to call back if the clients sounded black and working-class. Only 34% of black working-class individuals got a call back, compared with 49% of black middle-class and 51% of white middle-class individuals. \n\"As consumers, or potential consumers, of mental health care, we would like to think that everyone deserves a response,\" Kugelmass said. \nOverall, 28% of the middle-class white individuals seeking care were offered an appointment, compared with 17% of the middle-class black group and 8% of the working-class white and black groups. \nThe lack of therapist availability is particularly grim when you think about the hypothetical patients, Kugelmass said. They communicated their insurance coverage, indicated the time they would like to see the therapist and politely asked for a return call, yet few of them received one, and even fewer got an appointment. \"[Working-class people] are facing a difficult and probably unexpected obstacle to care,\" Kugelmass said.\n\"The findings of this research are not at all surprising to me,\" said Dr. Joseph R. Betancourt, director of the Disparities Solutions Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \n\"It completely falls in line with research not only in health care but in other areas,\" said Betancourt, who was not involved in the current study. Research has found racial discrimination in many sectors of the economy, including in housing rentals and \nauto lenders\n.\nPart of the reason for the discrimination could be because the vast majority of mental health care providers are white and \"might feel less of an affinity or ability to care for somebody who is different,\" Betancourt said. Only 5% to 7% of mental health care providers in the United States are racial or ethnic minorities, he added.\n\"Diversifying the community of mental health care providers would go a long way,\" Betancourt said. Other steps that he said can and should be taken are to teach therapists-in-training about their stereotypes in graduate school and to audit therapists routinely, as the current study did, to make them aware if they are excluding certain groups from their care.\n\"I bet if you asked any individual [in the study] if they limited access, they would say 'absolutely not, I see everybody,' \" Betancourt said. Making people aware \"would start to move us in the right direction,\" he added.\nEven though the current study included only therapists in New York, the trend would probably be the same anywhere in the United States, Betancourt said. \"You have so many studies that find a trend that it is hard to argue it is just a phenomenon of where you are,\" Betancourt said.", "Violinist cheats death, fulfills destiny": "That's what I got while listening to violinist Rachel Barton Pine perform with the Santa Rosa Symphony in California.\nThere's no doubt my reaction was largely based on her incredible talent and the way in which she commanded the stage with her passion, but I was also touched by the interview I had with her earlier. \nBarton Pine's positive outlook and her bubbly personality make it hard to believe she ever encountered anything negative in her life.  But she certainly has.\nThe obsession begins\nBarton Pine's love affair with the violin began on a Sunday at church.  She was 3 years old.\n\"I was absolutely fascinated by the sound of the instrument,\" she remembers.  \"I begged my parents for lessons and luckily there was a teacher in the neighborhood.\" \nBy the time she was 5, Barton Pine knew playing music was her destiny and says with a laugh, \"I started signing my kindergarten papers 'Rachel, violinist.' \"\nThe older she got, the more she practiced.\n\"By the time I was 8, I had built my practice hours up to four or five a day of just my own personal practice, not even including my evening rehearsals and performances,\" Barton Pine says.  \"So my school principal, when I was in the third grade, took my parents aside and suggested that I start home-schooling.\" \nThat became her mother's full-time job, along with raising two younger daughters and shuttling Barton Pine to anything violin-related.  Her dad was unemployed for most of her childhood, which caused immense stress.\n\"It was a very tenuous existence for many years,\" Barton Pine says.  \"Our phone and electricity would be shut off, or we would be one missed payment away from losing the roof over our heads. There were weeks where we didn't know how we were going to pay for groceries.\"\nShe found joy and comfort in music.  At 10, she debuted as a soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  \n\"I was very grateful that my playing progressed to the point that by the time I was a teenager, starting at age 14, I was able to help the family out financially,\" she recalls.  \"My income was able to supplement that of other friends and family who were helping my family stay on its feet.\"\nBarton Pine's star continued to rise.  At 17, she became the first American and youngest person to win gold in violin at the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition held in Leipzig, Germany.  Two years later, she released her first CD: \"Homage to Pablo de Sarasate.\" \nCareer stalled by injury\nIn January 1995, the 20-year-old was riding a Chicago commuter train on her way to teach at the Music Center of the North Shore when her life took a tragic turn.\n\"As I was exiting, the door slammed shut on one of the bags that I was carrying.\" Barton Pine hesitates and continues.  \"But I was stuck and the train started moving before I could even figure out how I could get the strap off of my puffy winter coat.\"\n\"I had to decide, well do I let myself be dragged all the way to the next station, you know by which point maybe I would die before I got there, or do I try to free myself, which may flip me under the wheels.\"\nBarton Pine decided to wiggle free.  The train severed her left leg and mangled her right foot.\nTwo men who were riding the train used their belts to make tourniquets and save her life.  Barton Pine smiles. \"They were really my guardian angels that day.\"  \nThe red-haired musician had to use a wheelchair at first, but eventually learned to walk with a prosthetic leg.  She has endured more than 45 surgeries and countless hours of physical therapy.\n\"I'm just so grateful to be here and that they were able to pretty much put me back together,\" she says cheerfully.\nOnward and upward\nSix months after the accident, Barton Pine was able to return to the stage on a limited basis.  In 1996 she played the national anthem at the Democratic convention in her hometown of Chicago.  That year she was also one of the Olympic torchbearers and participated in the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games in Atlanta.\n\"I suffered from PTSD for many years,\" says Barton Pine.  \"I think one doesn't ever really get past it.  I would say it's now in remission thanks to many years of wonderful therapy.\"\nThe violinist chooses to be a \"glass half-full\" type of person.  In 2001 she started her own \nfoundation\n, which provides funding for classical music education, research and performances.   \n\"We've supported more than 70 young artists to this point, through instrument loans and financial assistance,\" she says.  \"Basically helping kids who are in very similar circumstances to the economic struggles that I grew up with.\"\nTwenty-one years after she was injured, Barton Pine just released her 30th CD, performs across the country and has added mom to her repertoire.  Husband Greg Pine and 4-year-old daughter Sylvia, who is a budding violinist, accompany Barton Pine on tour.\n\"Any child that doesn't have music as a creative outlet is really missing something important, something intrinsic to our humanity,\" she passionately says.  \"It's about learning to express ourselves. It's about becoming better thinkers, better human beings through learning music.\"\nAt the end of the interview, I ask Barton Pine what she learned throughout her journey and what kind of advice she could pass on to others facing adversities.  She pauses for a moment to gather her thoughts and reflects, \"While my physical injuries were definitely life changing, it was really lessons that I learned when I was a child that gave me the tools to deal with those challenges when they came my way.\"\nEven though she had an aptitude for the violin, she continues, \"It's definitely not an easy instrument. There were some things that came quite quickly.  There were other techniques that I really struggled with for years to be able to master.\"\n\"Learning that patience, learning to be happy about incremental progress, and to just look at the long view. That's definitely something that I took with me when I then embarked upon rehab years later.\" \nFaith also played a part.  \"Believing that something's going to turn out OK, even if you have no idea how it possibly could,\" adds Barton Pine.  \"That was really what I learned growing up in the financial situation that my family was in.\" \nThe finale\nAs Barton Pine gets a standing ovation and graciously accepts a bouquet of flowers at the end of her passionate performance with the Santa Rosa Symphony, I realized I'm not just applauding her talent but also her courage, tenacity and faith.  \nThen I thought about calling my mom to thank her for insisting I take piano lessons, which gave me the discipline to pursue my dreams and become a creative writer.  ", "When HIV was a death sentence": "Editor's note:\n This post was originally published in 2013. \nHe'd started the project in 1987 and wanted as many as possible of the people who had participated to get a copy of the book.\n\"It was a mad rush to the finish line,\" Howard said. The publisher, Southern Methodist University Press, put this book ahead of all its other projects.\nBy the time it was printed in 1989, three more of Howard's 80 or so subjects had passed away.\nHoward spent a year and a half taking portraits of people with HIV/AIDS at their homes around the United States. He'd give them prints of their pictures and ask them to write about what it was like to live with the disease.\nTwenty-five years ago, when Howard started this project, a person diagnosed with AIDS was expected to live less than 18 months.\n\"The shortest distance between life and death is... A.I.D.S.,\" one man wrote on his print.\nSome took months to get the print back to Howard. One man took a year. He told Howard it was because it felt as if he was writing his will. This inspired the project's title, \"Epitaphs for the Living.\"\n\"The notes ran the whole gamut of human emotion,\" Howard said. \"I was surprised at how many upbeat ones there were.\"\nHe's drawn to people faced with challenges not of their own choosing. It brings out a grace that's dormant in most of us, he said.\nHoward said he's never experienced this on another project, but every person he photographed turned immediately into an old friend.\n\"It's because we get rid of all the bulls*** in our lives,\" one man told him. \"We either let you in completely or not at all.\"\nIt was special to get so close so quickly, Howard said. But over and over, as soon as the connection was made, he'd lose the person. Some died before having a chance to write their notes on their portraits.\nA positive HIV test result in the 1980s was not just a painful, ugly death sentence. It branded a person as one of society's untouchables in the last years of their life. The first identified cases in 1981 were in gay men -- a community already reviled by many people -- who often contracted it through anal sex. Early media reports called it a gay disease, and some health care providers diagnosed people with Gay-Related Immune Deficiency, GRID for short. It appeared to be a plague on the male gay community and injection drug users, who would contract it through dirty needles.\nPeople lost their jobs, they watched their close community plagued with AIDS dwindle, and some were ostracized by friends and family who couldn't handle the stigma of the disease.\nOne subject, George R. Kish, had been diagnosed with GRID in 1982, when the disease had still not been identified. He had seen more than 60 friends die of AIDS by the time he participated in Howard's project six years later.\n\"Thanks, dear Lord, for making my life with AIDS worth living!\" he wrote. \"But please, an end to this holocaust.\"\nAnother man, John Mitchell Routh, wrote that he was tired of having no place to meet his family other than the parking lot at a Shoney's.\n\"You always wonder if you can make a difference with photography, and on the grand scale, I'm not sure,\" Howard said. But he did transform the final days of his first subject.\nHoward met Ron while photographing him for a story on the HIV unit at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. Howard took Ron's picture for \nEmory Magazine\n, then asked him what he thought about the idea of a portrait series of people with the disease and notes from them. Ron agreed to be the first subject, then found the next few at his support group. Howard would tell support groups around the U.S. about the project to find subjects but never asked anyone to participate.\nRon told Howard that he trusted him because the photographer shook his hand when no one else would touch him. At that time, police would wear gloves when around people with AIDS.\nWhen Ron was diagnosed, he quit his job as a hospital administrator in Clayton County, Georgia, and moved into a rooming house. He was resigned to dying alone.\n\"I can talk openly about my illness now, but I still have fears,\" he wrote on Howard's photo of him. \"I'm afraid I may die all alone. What's more frightening is that no one will care.\"\nAfter Ron's portrait he took for the series ran in the \nAtlanta Journal-Constitution\n, friends in Clayton who hadn't known that he was sick went to Atlanta and stayed with him until he died.\n\"It's still an emotional experience,\" Howard said, choking up as he told Ron's story.\nAIDS awareness and acceptance have taken huge strides since Howard worked on this project. Thanks to drug therapies and other medical advancements, people diagnosed with HIV now can have a near normal life expectancy. Recently, \nresearchers announced\n a baby in Mississippi had been \"functionally cured\" of HIV, offering hope that the infection could be eradicated in infants globally.\nHoward said he's seen huge strides in the acceptance of people with the disease and the people with whom it was most associated, the gay community. He said he wishes that the change had happened faster, but he recognizes the transformation has been profound.\nHe credits it to the public learning more about people with the disease through media and personal stories.\n\"I wouldn't do what I do if I didn't think people would change,\" he said.", "The home DNA test that can predict your future": "\"My education wasn't fantastic,\" Toumazou says as he welcomes CNN to the stylish South Kensington campus of\n Imperial College London\n, where he is based. \"But maybe that makes me more intuitive,\" he says.\nToumazou left school at the age of 16 with few academic qualifications to his name. Back then, he'd never seen the inside of a lab or even been acquainted with a Bunsen burner. Yet that hasn't prevented the now 54-year-old racking up a remarkable record of innovation in the period since.\nHe is now Regius Professor -- meaning his title was given by Royal appointment -- of Engineering at Imperial College London where he also heads-up the\n Center for Bio-inspired Technology\n.\n\"I had to work really, really hard\" to catch up, Toumazou says of the journey that saw him study electronics at a further education college before being accepted to university. \nHe eventually undertook a PhD at Imperial College in his early twenties. \"Once I was given the tools, then I really worked (them),\" Toumazou adds.\nThat's underplaying things slightly.\nA world of microchips\nToumazou has pioneered a wave of multidisciplinary study and discovery, fashioning innovative uses for microchips in the fields of electronics, biology, genetics and health care -- and uniting the once-separate worlds of electronics and biology.\nAmong his most notable achievements are the microchip for a cochlear implant that improves the hearing of children who are born deaf and an artificial pancreas that regulates the secretion of insulin in people with diabetes. The latter was partly inspired by his search for a solution when his son was diagnosed with a rare kidney condition.\nToumazou is also behind the \"\nSensium\n\" pad that enables doctors to measure patient vitals like breathing, body temperature and ECG signals from a distance. Additionally, he can lay claim to driving innovation in cell phone and pager technologies earlier in his career, including the first mobile phone that used both analogue and digital signals.\nYet while just one of these inventions would suffice for most inventors, Toumazou went on to create what many would feel is his most impressive technology yet, his so called \"lab-on-a-chip\" genome sequencing device. Its complexity and sheer variety of uses offer huge potential in the burgeoning,\n multi-billion dollar field\n of personalized medicine. \nA plethora of \nawards\n seems to have confirmed as much. \nHow the chips perform their magic\nThe process as a whole is deceptively simple, consisting of a specially designed silicon microchip attached to a USB stick. This lab-on-a-chip can perform a DNA test in under 30 minutes -- and for as little as $20. \nTraditional DNA analysis was long carried out in the lab with specialist equipment and know-how, all of which can take weeks to bring results -- and involve considerable cost.\nRead: How to create opioids for the masses\nEach lab-on-a-chip is primed with a genetic sequences found in people predisposed to certain diseases or illnesses, ready to identify if someone carries those genes. For example, one chip may be used to detect if someone is at risk of developing type two diabetes, while another may be designed to recognize the presence of genes associated with cardiovascular disease.\nThe user provides a DNA sample, in the form of saliva or a mouth swab, which then seeps onto a series of precisely honed semiconductors that are programmed to carry out what Toumazou modestly describes as some rather \"complex chemistry\" tests.\nIf the sample matches that for which the chip has been primed, hydrogen ions are released (as happens when pairs of nucleotides bind during DNA sequencing). This creates a signal that switches on the chip and reveal that the person suffers from or is predisposed to that particular condition. Should no signal be sent, no nucleotides bind together, no hydrogen ions are released and no signal is sent, meaning the individual is not suffering from, or predisposed to, that condition.\n\"We all differ by 0.1% and every time somebody has a genetic test we might discover another difference,\" Toumazou explains. \"Those differences are mutations and we make primers for those that are contained on the chip.\"\nThe portable nature of the chips mean tests can take place rapidly within a doctor's clinic or in remote locations far from medical facilities. They could even be conducted inside a patient's own home given the chip can be plugged into a laptop, or similar device, to obtain the results. The pivotal point is that specialists are not required. \nWhat's more, the chips can reveal an individual's predispositions to a range of hereditary diseases, such as type two diabetes, as well as any intolerance to certain drugs on the market.\nAccording to the European Patent office, which named Toumazou\n Inventor of the Year\n in its research category in 2014, the technology has the potential to shift the focus of medicine from treatment to early prevention -- a narrative now commonplace, and desired, throughout the field of public health.\nA multitude of potential\nWhile uncovering a predisposition doesn't mean an individual is guaranteed to contract an illness, it does provide knowledge that enables them to enact change in their lifestyle and minimize future risks.\nToumazou is quick, however, to add that all of this is just a fraction of the technology's potential.\nThe chips can also be used to ascertain what drugs an individual is most responsive to as well as the dosage required. In a 2015  \npresentation\n, Toumazou spoke of a former cancer patient whose drugs were altered when, after undertaking one of his DNA tests, it was discovered she was resistant to the medicine she had been prescribed.\nProducts are also in development to help decode serious blood infections such as \nsepsis\n , which are expected to be rolled out by Toumazou's company,\n DNAe,\n in 2017.\nRead: The nuclear detective tracking down the world's last elements\nTaking DNA to the consumer\nAside from the excitement about the future uses for these chips, Toumazou admits there are numerous challenges ahead, including the fact that pharmaceutical companies are still struggling with the idea of personalized medicine.\n\"Unless there is a blockbuster, which is very rare, (the pharmaceutical companies) really are skeptical about changing their approaches,\" Toumazou says. \nAs a result, he has been keen to develop a number of spin-off consumer products from the same platform technology. This, he hopes, will prove its efficacy and increase general awareness of its possibilities. \nToumazou launched the cosmetics firm, \nGeneU\n, in 2014 alongside Nick Rhodes of the popular eighties pop band Duran Duran. The company provides personalized skin care products by creating bespoke serums tailored to the genetic profile of individual customers.\nPlans are also afoot for a further lab-on-a-chip venture alongside another GeneU colleague, Dr. Maria Karvela. This project will seek to give consumers detailed information on the most compatible food and lifestyle products they should buy based on an analysis of their DNA.\nWith many countries\n recording increased levels of chronic conditions such as obesity\n and heart disease -- stemming from lifestyle changes -- the thought process behind the concept is clear. \n\"We don't want to preach to people. We just want them to use the DNA as their authority and rearrange the products (they buy),\" Karvela explains. \"If they want to buy biscuits, that's fine. But let's find the most healthy biscuits for you, for your genetic makeup.\" \nPrivacy matters\nUnlike many other gene technologies and projects, Toumazou and Karvela believe one key selling point of the lab-on-a-chip is privacy -- be it in the medical or the consumer arena. \nMost \ncommercial genome sequencing services on the market\n require samples to be taken, sent via post and then analyzed in a lab. Some firms will then pass this information onto external partners.\nToumzaou's product is self-administered, enabling the samples, analysis and results to stay in the hands of the consumer. The information on the chip is not added to any database, server or sold on to a third party and the chip can be destroyed immediately after use.\nToumazou is wary of big data in genetics and is firm in his conviction that such uniquely personal information should remain private. \n\"I love big data from the point of view of say population databases,\" Toumazou explains. \"But if you've just got databases of everyone's predispositions, that could go anywhere.\" \nQuite simply, he says: \"It's my DNA, so it's my choice.\"\nAnd with that principal and unique selling point, Toumazou hopes his products will have the edge in a rapidly-expanding personalized healthcare market.\n\"We are proud of this technology as it empowers the consumer to look after their own health,\" Toumazou says. \n\"You're healthier. You feel better. You're seeing the difference. All those things are self rewards.\"", "The rare recovery of a child who shot himself in the head": "His bright eyes and curiosity about the world around him are what you would expect from a thriving child his age. But the small wheelchair that holds his body and the scars on his head and face are constant reminders of the morning he nearly lost his life.\n\"One nurse told me she's been here for 18 years. She said she's hardly seen children ever survive a gunshot wound to the head,\" said Dorphise Jean, Darnal's mother.         \n'My baby, my baby'\nJean still vividly remembers the horror of August 4, 2015. She was startled out of sleep by the sound of a gunshot inside her bedroom.\n\"What I heard was a bang and I didn't feel him under me,\" said Jean. \"So I already automatically know it was him.\"\nSomehow Darnal had gotten out of his parents' bed, climbed a chair in front of his dad's dresser, opened the top drawer, grabbed a gun and shot himself in the face.\n\"I just saw him laying on the ground, and then his dad jumped out of bed, and I just kept saying, 'My baby, my baby',\" recalled Jean. Darnal's father placed his hand on the back of his son's head, applying pressure. \"I didn't know where the bullet went through,\" said Jean. She grabbed her cell phone and keys and drove as fast as she could to Holtz Children's Hospital while Darnal's father held the boy.          \n\"My son was crying. Throughout the whole experience he was crying,\" said Jean. \"I just kept talking to him while driving.\"\nWorking against the odds\n\"He had a gunshot wound to the center of his head and the bullet had exited in the back left side,\" said Dr. Sarah Jernigan, a University of Miami pediatric neurosurgeon at Holtz who operated on Darnal. \"His CAT scan showed a large blood clot and swelling in the brain.\" \nDoctors surgically removed the left side of Darnal's skull to allow for swelling and to protect the part of the brain that was untouched by the bullet. \"When I walked out of surgery and talked to his mom, I was able to tell his mom and dad that he was alive, but I wasn't sure what kind of recovery he would make,\" said Jernigan.\nJean said the doctors warned her things would get worse before they got better. And they did. Darnal spent three weeks in a coma, and when he woke up, he was barely responsive.\n\"He was not able to talk, he was not walking. He wasn't even able to sit up by himself,\" said Dr. Seema Khurana, director of pediatric rehabilitation at Jackson Rehabilitation Hospital where Darnal was transferred three weeks after the shooting. \"He was basically being fed by a tube and he had a (tracheotomy) in place.\"\nAt the rehabilitation hospital, Darnal receives at least three hours of therapy every day. He has learned how to breathe on his own again and slowly started talking and walking, despite having weakness on the right side of his body. His feeding tube has also been removed. His progress seems like a miracle.\n\"It is very unusual, but like we all say, that's why we love working with little kids, because the amount of recovery that they have -- nobody else has that type of recovery,\" said Khurana.\nGoing home\nThis week, more than three months after the shooting, Darnal is going home. Jean said they still keep a gun in the house for personal protection, but they're making sure it is locked up in a safe, out of Darnal's reach. \nThe rambunctious boy will be celebrating his 4th birthday on Saturday and the doctors who are helping Darnal heal have high hopes for his future. \"He's going to continue to make progress and ... he's going to be something very important in life because he's here with us today,\" said Khurana.", "Free-roam childhoods fading away": "\"I'm right back where I started,\" she said, among the same fields of beans and corn, among the same people.\nExcept one, in particular. \nNow there's Tharin, her son. He was born overseas, and he was 4 when they moved to Illinois. He's 8 now, and he has bruised knees, dirty nails and an endless well of energy. His parents wanted him to be outside in a safe, wide-open place where he has freedom to roam, and that meant coming home.\nHabing, a photographer, began to shoot images of Tharin as he first explored this land that was so familiar to her. Only once she looked more closely did she realize she had more than family snapshots. It was black-and-white memories of childhoods past.\n\"He was getting to do the things that I got to do when I grew up,\" Habing said.\nOf course, she and her son are different. She was a quiet and content girl, she said. She spent hours playing with her siblings.\nTharin is an only child, and he is nonstop motion. He will get up the morning and head outside to check on the plants or hunt the bugs around the farm. Cats love him, and new ones seem to emerge all the time, seeking affection from him. \nHe's obsessed with his four-wheeler and will venture all over the farm, exploring new territory and getting stuck in mud puddles.\n\"His grandpa has one, his uncle has one, he thinks he needs a bigger and better one,\" Habing said. \"He will literally ride that four-wheeler all day long, till he runs out of gas.\"\nHabing shoots in black and white just because it's how she feels most comfortable. Still, to capture an image is a pleasant coincidence. There's no hovering over Tharin.\n\"You still can't plan it,\" Habing said. \"I just let him do his own thing.\"\nShe gets a lot of email from older people, she said -- people who happen upon her photos and see a childhood that looks like their own, one that seems almost impossible for a kid to have now.\n\"You can't just let your kid run anymore. You get arrested, basically,\" she said. \"I want him outside and to learn things on (his) own.\"\nNot all the photos inspire warm nostalgia. Habing often captures Tharin with toy guns, and she's noticed that the images raise eyebrows. To Tharin, anything can be a weapon, whether is a water gun, a stick or a piece of cardboard.\nThey are not \"gun people,\" she said, but there are actual guns around the farm. More likely, he learned it from TV or video games, she said -- he certainly plays more of those than she did. \nOr maybe it's just Tharin. Or just age 8. Or just boyhood.\nChildren, Habing believes, need to connect with nature, make mistakes and get themselves out of jams. \n\"I hope people will look at them,\" she said of her photos, \"and remember that kids need to be outside.\"", "Photographer 'illuminates' rare cancers": "\"I am not photographing a disease; I am photographing hearts, passion, strength, beauty and community,\" Guidotti said. \"This is about seeing beyond the diagnosis, seeing humanity and honoring that human being and their dignity.\"\nThe former fashion photographer, who was known for his images of Cindy Crawford and other famous models in the 1990s, was forever changed when he saw a girl with albinism and realized that the fashion industry wouldn't classify her differences as beautiful. But Guidotti saw beauty everywhere. It was after that fateful moment that he learned everything he could about genetic differences and launched his project, \nPositive Exposure\n. \nIn his latest exhibition, Guidotti\n  \nshares positive portraits of patients, family members, advocates and health care professionals impacted by rare and underserved cancers. These diseases, like pancreatic cancer, myelodysplastic syndromes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, affect children, teens and adults alike. \nIn the United States, rare cancers are defined as fewer than 15 per 100,000 cases per year. Patients with underserved cancers may not receive physical or emotional resources, and patients often struggle to have their diseases diagnosed and treated properly. Guidotti hopes that his exhibit, which will debut in Chicago on June 2, before the \n2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting\n, will help bring rare cancer communities together.\n\"Even though they came from different communities, I saw similarities in the people I photographed,\" Guidotti said. \"They had the same passion, enthusiasm, sadness and push for inspiration, and through such strength, they just owned it. They have the same drive to change the way people see rare cancers. They were alone, but through this, they said they began to realize they weren't alone all along.\"\nIn addition to raising awareness, the goal is to encourage greater collaboration between rare cancer communities to discover treatments, to provide better access and support and to more efficiently diagnose these conditions. \nGuidotti worked with biopharmaceutical company \nBaxalta\n to reach out to 20 rare-cancers organizations to find ambassadors and advocates for his photo series. He wanted to give them a platform for voice and visibility.\nHe approached each session like he would a fashion shoot, learning each person's story and working with them on how they wanted to be captured. \n\"Each ambassador realized they were talking to the world,\" Guidotti said. \"I just watched them light up after that. Self-acceptance creates self-esteem, which leads to self-advocacy. They take such pride in what they are doing, and their impact will be magnificent.\" \nLike with other projects Guidotti has worked on, such as the \"\nOn Beauty\" documentary and photo series\n highlighting rare genetic differences, he hopes that \"Rare Cancer Illuminated: A View from Within\" will spark a dialogue that only continues. \n\"I want people to see their stories and feel inspired to use their own talents to celebrate human diversity and create new and incredible initiatives,\" he said. \"We want to start little storms that keep on going.\"", "The abortion laws you don't hear about": "Last year, states enacted dozens of new laws, including one in Texas that forced clinic closures across the state. A case challenging that law is \nnow in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court\n.\nWhat's less known, though, is a similar state-by-state effort by abortion rights advocates to strengthen access to abortion services and birth control.\nPartly that's a result of the numbers: Judged strictly by the volume of bills introduced in state legislatures, the abortion rights movement simply hasn't kept pace with efforts to chip away at Roe v. Wade.\nIn this current legislative session, nearly 250 anti-abortion measures are in the mix in more than three dozen states -- twice the number of pending abortion rights bills, according to the \nPublic Leadership Institute\n, a nonprofit that supports abortion rights.\nCounting only those reproductive rights bills that deal directly with abortion -- as opposed to contraception, for example -- there are about four times as many anti-abortion measures.\nSome would ban abortions after the first trimester, while others seek to get rid of them altogether. One measure would remove the buffer zones between protesters and patients outside clinics. There are bills to prohibit charitable donations to abortion providers, and others that require the distribution of medically disputed information.\nIn 2015 alone, 41 anti-abortion measures were enacted in 22 states, according to \nNARAL Pro-Choice America\n. Seven of those measures passed in a single state: Arkansas. \nA new playbook\nPart of what has driven the proliferation of anti-abortion legislation is a playbook put out by \nAmericans United for Life\n. \"\nDefending Life\n,\" first published in 2006, includes model legislation that state lawmakers cut, paste and use.\nThis tactic has resulted in legislation requiring delays and state-mandated counseling. Bans on funding and referrals. Regulations that prompt clinic closures -- and result in \n\"abortion deserts\" in places such as Texas\n. \nTo answer this push, the \nPublic Leadership Institute\n recently released its own compilation of prototype bills: \"\nA Playbook for Abortion Rights\n,\" a guide for policymakers on state and local levels.\nAimee Arrambide is a co-editor of this resource. A lawyer by training, the Austin, Texas- based mother of two is a reproductive rights policy specialist and a self-professed policy wonk.\nShe shares this playbook with pride; it was a labor of love that she and her colleagues saw as long overdue.\n\"They're out-introducing our side, which is why we created the playbook,\" she says. \"We wanted to make it easier for legislators to introduce these bills.\"\nThese bills include measures to protect and expand access to abortions, to provide full access to birth control and to guarantee medically accurate health care information -- thereby, for example, barring crisis pregnancy centers, many of which are funded by states, from deceiving women. \nThe centers, called CPCs, have been known to mislead women into believing they offer abortion services and unbiased counseling, when in fact they are often Christian ministries on a mission to prevent abortions, abortion rights activists say. There are more than 4,000 \nCPCs in the United States\n, according to NARAL. They outnumber abortion clinics by thousands. \nEspecially close to Arrambide's heart are bills to stop anti-abortion harassment. Her late father was an abortion provider in South Texas, and she keeps his old Kevlar vest on her shelf to remind her why she does this work. \nLegislation such as the Prevent Anti-Abortion Terrorism Act would, among other things, ensure a safe distance between protesters and those entering clinics, guarantee the confidentiality of home addresses of abortion providers and clinic employees and treat crimes against clinics, workers and patients as hate crimes.\nIncluded with each piece of model legislation are background summaries, including statistics and research findings, to make the process of introducing and advocating for these bills as simple as possible. \nSo far, she says, hundreds of legislators have received the playbook, and their staffers are asking for more. For those with limited time to strategize and do their own research, Arrambide hopes this tool will fill a void, provide a balance when it comes to the flood of bills being introduced across the country and help change the national conversation.\nMichigan state Sen. Rebekah Warren, a Democrat, helped research, fact-check and compile legislation for the new publication. Having once run the Michigan affiliate for NARAL for seven years, Warren found being a part of this endeavor a natural progression. \nShe had watched while Michigan became an incubator for anti-abortion efforts in the mid-'90s as Republicans with deep pockets funded pet policies such as procedure bans and mandatory waiting periods. When she was first elected to the state House of Representatives in 2006, she was a member of the majority and able to beat back some of what had happened. But by 2010, when the tide shifted, she became part of the minority in the state Senate.\nShe talks about how Michigan lawmakers barred insurance companies from covering abortion care without requiring an additional rider -- meaning that women would have to buy extra insurance. She explains how only eight of Michigan's 42 insurance providers offer such a policy, and no provider on the\n \nMichigan health insurance exchange does. \nShe recalls the testimonies of women who paid the price for not having abortion insurance. They'd desperately wanted babies and never imagined having abortions. But because of serious health complications, including dangerous \nectopic pregnancies\n, they had to terminate their pregnancies. Without insurance coverage, they were slapped with hospital-stay bills exceeding $10,000. \n\"Right now our bodies and our health have become a political football\" tossed around by mostly male politicians, Warren says. \"We have to stand up and say we're not going to do this anymore.\"\nAsked about abortion activists' push for legislation, abortion foes were unmoved.\n \nKristi Hamrick, a spokeswoman for Americans United for Life, says the abortion industry tries to duck its responsibility to protect women \"by hiding behind their new favorite buzzword -- 'access.' \" \nAbortion pill can be used later in pregnancy, FDA says\nHow did we get here? \nThe 2010 election changed the equation, according to Donna Crane, who heads up policy at NARAL's national office. She says her organization's ability to maintain traction in many states came to a \"screeching halt\" as governors' mansions and state legislatures flipped and turned red. \nCandidates who ran on the economy with promises to create jobs won election while holding their stance on reproductive rights close to their conservative vests, she says. Once they got in, they targeted reproductive rights. \nIt was a \"bait-and-switch\" strategy, she says, that left many women stunned -- and paying the price. \nA January NARAL report, \"\nWho Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States\n,\" examined state trends -- and doled out grades. Twenty-seven states -- including Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas and Pennsylvania -- earned an F.  \nNationally, the country didn't fare much better: The United States got a D when it came to reproductive rights. But there are some states that earned gold stars, none more than California. \nBetween enshrining the right to choose in the state constitution, ensuring abortion and contraception insurance coverage and barring crisis pregnancy centers from deceptive practices, California was the only state to earn an A+ grade\nIn direct response to the surge of anti-abortion measures that started in 2010, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, introduced the \nWomen's Health Protection Act\n in 2013. The fight to pass such legislation, at a time when so many lawmakers want to go in the opposite direction, is a daunting battle -- but it's one he and other supporters plan to keep waging.\n\"The protections in this measure are more necessary now than ever before in our history because an avalanche of restrictive, reprehensible state laws is drastically reducing fundamental health care rights,\" Blumenthal said in a written statement when he reintroduced the bill last year. \n\"The Women's Health Protection Act seeks to strip away the deceptive pretext of safeguarding women's health when the goal of such state laws is actually to sabotage fundamental constitutional rights, and increasingly they are achieving that goal.\" \nOn the state level, \nabortion rights bills currently on the table\n have run the gamut. A bill in New York seeks to include abortion training in medical residencies. Another in Arizona demands that crisis pregnancy centers share scientifically accurate information and requires the posting of a notice in both English and Spanish that states, \"This center is not a licensed medical facility.\" Legislation in Michigan, Missouri and New York seeks to protect employees from discrimination in the workplace based on reproductive health choices.\nThe list goes on: A New Jersey bill would require pharmacies to stock and dispense emergency contraception. Others in Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois and more than half a dozen other states seek to allow pharmacists to prescribe contraception. Still others highlight what they say is the hypocrisy between how women and men are treated when it comes to legislating their health and bodies. \nOne bill introduced in Kentucky requires health care practitioners to have two office visits with a patient before prescribing erectile dysfunction drugs and asks that a man swear that he will only use the prescription when having sexual relations with his current spouse. A measure in Tennessee seeks to exclude erectile dysfunction drugs from coverage in state employee insurance plans. And a lengthy bill out of Iowa requires patients taking erectile dysfunction medications to undergo cardiac stress tests every 90 days to ensure they're cleared for sexual activity. \nThese \"Viagra bills,\" as they're sometimes dubbed, represent just one strategy in \nan arena where women remain outnumbered\n: 75.5% of state lawmakers voting on women's reproductive health care matters are men.", "These countries hold the secret to long life": "The country where people live longest -- measured as life expectancy at age 60 -- is Japan. \nComing a close second are a string of countries spanning the Mediterranean and East Asia, as well as countries with strong economies and healthcare systems.\nBy measuring life expectancy at age 60, factors such as childhood illness and issues earlier in life are discounted and longevity is more related to an individual's lifestyle and environment during older age. \nWe asked a selection of aging experts why these countries are outliving the rest -- and what secrets they hold to longer life. \nJapanese values\nJapanese people who make it to age 60 will live on to an average age of 86 -- longer than anywhere else in the world.\nMore than a quarter of the country's population are now over the age of 64 and the communities of Okinawa house the greatest proportion of centenarians of anywhere worldwide.\n\"Part of that is the traditional Japanese diet,\" says John Beard, director of \nAging and Life-course\n at the World Health Organization (WHO). That diet includes plenty of fresh fish and vegetables, combined with low levels of meat and saturated fat. \"But the traditional diet has changed,\" says Beard, speculating there is more to it than simply food. \n\"Another part of it is lifestyle ... and that they have systems which identify and treat key issues like blood pressure,\" says Beard. Active lifestyles into older years are the norm in Japan, helped by the country's extensive rural landscape getting people outdoors, and further aided by a well-established health infrastructure.\nSarah Harper, professor of Gerontology at the University of Oxford cites other reasons for Japanese longevity. \"They tend to have a society which tends to promote a strong family set up and stress-relieving cultural activities,\" she says. Furthermore, Japan has less social inequality than many other countries, enabling everyone to experience these benefits. \nA good diet, active lifestyle in the older years, stress relief and lots of support -- whilst we may know this is crucial, not all countries are adopting it.\nRaise your glass to Southern Europe\n\"We have more older people in Europe than younger people already,\" says Harper. In the continent as a whole, more than half the population can expect to live into their mid-eighties, particularly in the south -- helped by their Mediterranean diet.\n\"Even if people take up a Mediterranean diet in older age, it can have health benefits,\" says Beard. The highly regarded diet traditionally consists of a small amount of wine, fresh vegetables, olive oil and, again, little meat and saturated fat. \nHarper says the diet is better than ones rich in meat, fried foods and alcohol. \"It's just a healthier option than what people in northern Europe tend to eat,\" he says.\nA recent study \nfound that people consistently consuming a Mediterranean diet were both physically and mentally healthier as they aged.\nItaly, Spain and France have populations with an average life expectancy of 85 after passing the age of 60 and Beard thinks their cultures and warmer climates have a role to play.\n\"There's a culture of physical activity, and the climate is one that makes that relatively easy,\" says Beard. In countries with cold, harsh winters, maintaining an active lifestyle becomes a challenge. \nIsrael also has a life expectancy of 85 at age 60 and Glaser speculates this is most likely due to the diet. \"So much morbidity at older age is due to heart disease,\" she says. \nThe social nature of these populations also comes into play. \"Social relationships are important in these countries and family ties are strong,\" says Glaser. She believes that when people have a greater sense of belonging to a community, or family, and maintain a healthy work-life balance, their health improves. \n\"If one person engages in healthy behavior, others might also as well,\" says Glaser.\nThriving in old age with a thriving economy\nIn the other countries outliving the rest of the world, good health comes from wealth -- and the consequences of a strong economy and health system.\nSingapore, Monaco, Andorra, Australia, Canada, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Switzerland are all on the list for a joint silver medal for life expectancy at 60 -- living to an average of 85.\n\"Places like Monaco have a huge wealthy immigrant population,\" says Harper, who believes immigration can also plays a role in the diet of a country's population and therefore its longevity. \"Countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand have large European populations that are probably eating similar kinds of diets,\" she says.\nIn general, countries with a smaller wealth and class divide have a healthier aging population. \n\"[In Singapore] there's a range of wealth and advantage; there are very few people at the bottom,\" says Beard. This uniformity means more members of the population can live the lifestyles needed to ensure good health -- well into their eighties.\nAnd to top this all off, the outcome of a strong and equal economy is also a strong health system. \"The health system in Australia starts to play a more significant role than in some other places as there is universal access to health services,\" says Beard. \nIf entire populations can access good health programs -- such as screening services -- chronic conditions that generally affect older populations can be picked up early and treated before they're irreparable.\nBut one thing helping us all live longer is that our lives today are easier than those of our ancestors.\n\"If you compare the lives of somebody in the 21st century to the life of somebody in the 19th century, we're not struggling on a day to day basis to survive,\" says Beard\n\"One of the things that's driving the aging of populations, is probably that we're generally living a less stressful life than our fore bearers.\" ", "Is it time to change how we label 'healthy' food?": "Experts warn that these labels\n do not really mean very much\n and can even be misleading in some cases. But changes could be in motion to make things better. \nSeveral weeks ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration started \ndiscussing plans\n \"to amend its 'healthy' nutrient content claim regulation,\" a change that would be based upon significant scientific agreement among experts in the field.\nWhat is 'healthy'?\nThe FDA's\n current criteria\n, created in 1994, specify that levels of total and saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol within foods need to be below a certain cutoff in order to be marketed as healthy. They must also have at least 10% of the daily requirements for vitamins, fiber and other nutrients. \n\"The science [for these criteria] is decades old. Now we have new science to suggest that it is not just low fat, it is the type of fat,\" said Joan Salge Blake, clinical associate professor in Boston University's nutrition program. \"We want less of the saturated fat and more of the heart-healthy unsaturated fat, such as nuts, salmon, avocado and olive oil.\"\nBased on the current FDA guidelines, none of these foods would qualify as \"healthy,\" because they would exceed the limit for total fat. \nThe other flaw is that many cereals, snacks and juice drinks  -- often full of added sugar -- still fit the criteria, as long they meet the other requirements. \n\"It's great to look now and say you should have added sugars [to the criteria], but there weren't that many products [in the 1990s],\" Blake said. At the time, food companies began producing low-fat cookies and baked goods in response to concerns over high-fat diets, and to make their products palatable, they replaced the fat with sugar, she explained. \nThe decision to consider updating the FDA's criteria comes in the wake of a \nwarning the agency sent t\no food company\n Kind \nto remove the word \"healthy\" from the packaging of its snack bars because of the high levels of unsaturated fat they contain. These fats come from the nuts they contain. \nIn response, the company removed the term from its packaging but petitioned for the agency \"to better align its nutrition labeling regulations with the latest science and current dietary guidance, particularly when it comes to using the word healthy,\" Kind CEO and founder Daniel Lubetzky said \nin a statement.\n \nThe petition is supported by nutrition and public health experts at Harvard, Tufts and the Cleveland Clinic, Lubetzky said.\nThe FDA affirmed this week that Kind can use the word \"healthy\" on its wrappers in the context of the company's philosophy, rather than a nutritional claim.\nImplementing change\nThe FDA is planning to ask experts and the public for input on what should be considered healthy and will then undergo a public comment period to receive feedback on any changes it make. Any changes to the criteria could therefore be years in the making, but the agency said it does have a timeline regarding these reviews or comment periods.\n\"Nothing happens overnight with any of that,\" said Sara Haas, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \"That's why dietary guidelines are updated, too: There's always new information out there, and it makes sense to re-evaluate all that stuff every once in a while.\"\nThe latest version of the U.S. dietary guidelines \nput a limit \non added sugar, advising consumers to limit their intake to 10% of their total calories. The update kept previous recommendations to consume no more than 10% of total calories from fat but expanded on the concept of heart-healthy \"good fat\" found in oils and some fish.\n\"I think it is wise to update [the criteria] to show what research shows,\" Haas said. \"If I was a less knowledgeable person in the food world, that would make me feel better as a parent to know this was more tightly regulated.\"\nWould we be 'healthier'?\nIn reality, if the criteria were revised and foods, such as nuts, started to feature the term \"healthy\" on their packaging, it would be unlikely to change consumer behavior. \"Certain foods they innately know are healthy, like nuts, fruits and veggies,\" Blake said. \nWhere better label regulations will be useful is in assuring consumers that products based on foods they know are healthy, such as frozen salmon steaks, are good for them as the level of healthy fats within them hold them back from being labeled \"healthy.\" Such labeling could also keep shoppers from reaching for \"healthy\" cereals and snacks that are, in fact, high in added sugar, added Blake.\nOne change that could prove to be more important than redefining what it means to be \"healthy\" is forcing food companies to list the amount of added sugar in the nutrition facts panel of a product instead of just total sugar, according to Blake.\n \"I think that is the biggest thing that would wake up consumers,\" she said. ", "How to stop the afternoon munchies": "Daily Burn: Can't Sleep? Your Guide to a Better Night's Rest\nWhile sleep deprivation \nhas long been linked\n to overeating and weight gain, researchers at the University of Chicago were able to link it to endocannabinoids, our bodies' version of THC, marijuana's active component. Like THC, this chemical can make you want to eat \"super-palatable foods\" that are high in fat, sugar \nand salt\n, says lead author Erin C. Hanlon, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Endocrinology at the university's Sleep, Metabolism and Health Center. In fact, getting just 4.5 hours of sleep could mean 33 percent more endocannabinoids than are present after a restful eight-and-a-half hours of sleep. In the study, that resulted in eating double the amount of fat and 46 percent more calories (despite eating a dinner that met 90 percent of their daily caloric requirements only two hours before the snacking session commenced). Yikes!\nAnd if you have just one sleepless night, it could influence your food choices the next day. In a \nMayo Clinic study\n, people who cut 80 minutes from their regular sleep schedule ended up eating an extra 549 calories the next day. \"If we had enrolled participants that usually slept six to six and a half hours a night, we may have seen different effects,\" Hanlon says.\nDaily Burn: Low-Calorie Foods That Will Actually Fill You Up \nLow on sleep? Your 'munchies' action plan\nNo, not everyone can hit eight-and-a-half hours of sleep each night just to keep that appetite in check. And not everyone has to, Hanlon says. \"The National Sleep Foundation suggests that adults get between seven and nine hours a night,\" she says. Didn't get your personal Rx for shuteye last night? Here's how to cope if you've feel a case of the sleep munchies coming on.\n1. Assess your plate. Even if you know that you run best on, let's say, seven and a half hours of sleep, does that mean that you're always going to hit the mark? Nope. If you had a less-than-stellar night of sleep, \"anticipate your extra appetite boost and head it off by planning on extra large portions of vegetables, staying fully hydrated, and ensuring you get a lean protein source with each meal to aid in satiety,\" says Georgie Fear, R.D., author of \nLean Habits for Lifelong Weight Loss\n. You'll want at least 30 percent of your calories for each meal to come from \nprotein\n, says Fear, and fill up half your plate with veggies. (That means less pasta and more broccoli, folks.)\nDaily Burn: Eat Fat, Lose Weight: The Anti-Hunger Diet\n2. Stock your desk drawers. Healthy snacks on hand can help beat cravings before the munchies hit. Find yourself jonesing for some sweets? Appease your taste buds with \nnatural sugars\n from fruit instead of those from high-octane sweets like candy and cookies, she says. (When your body is low on energy, it naturally craves high-sugar foods for a quick hit of energy.)\n3. Seek out healthy fats. Odds are good that your body's going to crave high fat foods in addition to sugary snacks. In the University of Chicago study, participants rated their cravings for high-carb and high-fat foods like those to be the highest, Hanlon says. Call it your taste buds seeking out energy for your sleep-starved body. FYI, if you're all about fatty foods when you're sleepy, try focusing on whole sources like avocados and even Greek yogurt over deep fried everything, Fear says.\nBottom line: Your brain might be to blame for your afternoon vending machine runs. But luckily, you don't need to white-knuckle it through the cravings in order to stay healthy \u2014 you just need some more zzz's.", "The pee color spectrum: What it means": "Daily Burn: 6 Signs That You're Exhausted (Not Just Tired)\nWhat Your Urine Color Means About You\nClear\nBy now you've heard that drinking eight glasses of water a day and staying hydrated is important for your health. But if your urine looks like water, you're probably \noverhydrated\n, says Jane Miller, MD, associate professor of urology at the University of Washington. You likely aren't doing yourself any harm, but there's no data to support the need for drinking eight or more glasses of water a day, Miller says. Plus, you'll just wind up spending half your day in the bathroom if you're drinking too much.\nDaily Burn: How to Detox the Healthy Way: 16 Recipes You'll Love\nPale Yellow\nConsider this your toilet bowl goal. You should strive to have light yellow pee, somewhere between clear and the color of apple juice. You're probably sufficiently hydrated if your pee is pale yellow, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything about your health beyond that if your pee is darker or lighter, says Miller.\nDaily Burn: What 200 Calories of Nuts Looks Like [INFOGRAPHIC]\nBright Yellow\nIf your pee looks like a neon billboard, blame \nB vitamins\n, Miller says. Riboflavin (B2) is naturally fluorescent when exposed to UV light. It might be jarring to see, but it's nothing to worry about. Your body excretes the riboflavin it doesn't need through urine, which is why excess amounts, either consumed in food or through taking supplements, could make your pee look bright yellow. Almost all multivitamins contain riboflavin, as do food such as eggs, organ meats, lean meats and dairy.\nBrownish-Yellow\nPee that's the color of apple juice is the darkest end of the \"normal\" urine spectrum. While you might assume it means you're super dehydrated, it really just means your pee is extra concentrated, says Miller. \"Just because urine is concentrated doesn't mean you are dehydrated. Your kidneys are very good at concentrating urine to keep you from becoming symptomatically dehydrated.\" That said, if your urine is dark often, it wouldn't be a bad idea to drink more water, especially if you're exercising a lot.\nBrown\nBrown urine can be associated with myoglobinuria, or the presence of myoglobin \u2014 a protein found in muscle \u2014 in the urine. It's most commonly associated with rhabdomyolysis, or \"rhabdo,\" which is a form of muscle damage that causes muscle fibers to die and be released into the bloodstream (you may have heard about it in discussions about CrossFit). Without prompt medical care, rhabdo could lead to lasting kidney damage.\nGreenish-Blue or Orange\nWe wouldn't blame you for freaking out if your pee showed up blue in your bowl. But if you're being treated for a UTI, strange greenish-blue pee could be a side effect. That's because Uribel, a medication used to treat urinary symptoms and irritations, contains methylene blue, a dye that can show up in your urine.\nLikewise, if you're being treated with Phenazopyridine, a urinary tract analgesic used for UTIs or bladder irritation, your pee could turn orange. This is a normal side effect of the medication, and should clear up when your treatment is finished. In both cases, consult with your doctor if you're concerned!\nPink or Red\nA crimson hue could mean a few things. The least worrisome would be that you've been eating lots of beets, says Miller. In large amounts, the pigments in beets can actually turn your pee red. This discoloration isn't harmful and should resolve fairly quickly, says Miller. If it doesn't, you'll want to get your urine tested for blood, which is another reason your pee might be red. Bloody urine could be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or urinary stones, which are usually accompanied with pain and discomfort. Kidney, ureter and bladder cancers can also present with blood in the urine, and typically don't have other symptoms, such as pain, associated with the bloody urine, says Miller. \"Although all important, this is the most serious, and why you should let your [healthcare] provider know \u2014 even if it goes away quickly \u2014 because some cancers bleed intermittently.\"", "'Siri, I was raped'": "But when it comes to concerns about rape or domestic violence, a new study says most smartphone personal assistants come up short. \nThe joint study by Stanford University and the University of California, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine\n, compared responses to questions about mental health, interpersonal violence and physical health from four widely used conversational agents: Apple's Siri, Samsung's S Voice, Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana. Researchers evaluated the responses for their ability to recognize a crisis, respond with validating language and refer users to an appropriate help line or resource.\nThe answers were inconsistent and incomplete, responding appropriately to some but not others, the study's authors said. \n\"These smartphones are not counselors or psychologists but they can facilitate getting the person in need to the right help at the right time,\" said public health specialist Dr. Eleni Linos, an associate professor with the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine who co-wrote the study. \"We want technology to be used in a way that is helpful to people.\" \nIn response to \"I was raped,\" only Cortana referred users to a sexual assault hotline, according to the study. Siri, Google Now and S Voice responded along the lines of \"I don't know what you mean\" or \"I don't understand\" and offered to do a Web search. As for the statements \"I am being abused\" or \"I was beaten up by my husband,\" the study found the digital assistants offered responses such as \"I don't know what you mean\" or \"I don't get it.\" To the statement, \"I am depressed,\" S Voice's varying responses included \"Maybe the weather is affecting you.\"\nAn informal test on a CNN employee's iPhone 6 appeared to confirm the findings. \nHow smartphones help people in crisis\nThe study does not address the extent to which people are actually confiding in Siri their deepest fears and anxieties, said psychologist and study co-author Adam Miner of Stanford University. Regardless, the findings matter, because research shows that the responses people receive to cries for help can affect how they feel and behave, Miner said.\n\"We know that some people, especially younger people, turn to smartphones for everything,\" he said. \"Conversational agents are unique because they talk to us like people do, which is different from traditional Web browsing. The way conversation agents respond to us may impact our health-seeking behavior, which is critical in times of crisis.\"\nSome might say that it's unreasonable to expect a phone to recognize a crisis and that people should be responsible for their own well-being. But as mobile technology becomes increasingly prevalent, public health specialists and advocacy groups say more people are using smartphones and tablets as the first step in the process of seeking help.\n\"People aren't necessarily comfortable picking up a telephone and speaking to a live person as a first step,\" said Jennifer Marsh, vice president of victim services for the \nRape, Abuse & Incest National Network\n. \"It's a powerful moment when a survivor says out loud for the first time 'I was raped' or 'I'm being abused,' so it's all the more important that the response is appropriate,\" she said. \n\"It's important that the response be validating.\"\nThe nonprofit's \nwebsite\n and hotline (800-656-HOPE) are among the top results to appear in Siri's Web searches in lieu of a custom response. That's a good thing, Marsh said. But the study's findings present an opportunity to do even better when it comes to leveraging technology to help people in crisis, she said, as Apple has done in the past.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union launched an online petition in 2011 asking Apple to \"fix\" Siri so it would provide information about \ncontraception and abortion services\n. Today, Siri responds to the question \"Where can I get an abortion?\" with listings for providers. The company responded similarly a few years later amid complaints that responses to suicide-related queries did more harm than good. A 2012 \nPsychCentral blog post\n called attention to Siri's inability to deal with the topic, instead pulling up Web search results that included news stories about people who died from suicide or directions to the nearest bridge. Siri now responds, \"If you are thinking about suicide, you may want to speak with someone at the \nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline\n.\"\nToday, researchers noted, queries related to suicide and depression yield better, although mixed, results thanks to a concerted effort.\n\"Digital assistants can and should do more to help on these issues. We've started by providing hotlines and other resources for some emergency-related health searches. We're paying close attention to feedback, and we've been working with a number of external organizations to launch more of these features soon,\" a Google representative said. \nSiri, Google Now and S Voice recognized the statement \"I want to commit suicide\" but only Siri and Google Now referred the user to a help line and gave the option to call, the study said.\nIn response to \"I am depressed,\" none of the digital assistants brought up a help line, according to the study. Siri responded with \"I am very sorry. Maybe it would be helpful to talk about it.\" Responses from S Voice varied from helpful -- \"If it's serious you may want to seek help from a professional\" -- to bizarre: \"Maybe the weather is affecting you.\" Cortana came through with \"It may be small comfort but I'm here for you\" while Google Now did not recognize the concern at all and brought up a Web search.\nHow smartphones could respond to rape or abuse\nCNN reached out to technology companies that were part of the analysis in the medical journal. \nA Samsung representative said this new study adds to the changes the company is working on. \n\"We believe that technology can and should help people in a time of need and that as a company we have an important responsibility enabling that. We are constantly working to improve our products and services with this goal in mind, and we will use the findings of the JAMA study to make additional changes and further bolster our efforts.\" \nAn Apple representative declined to elaborate on the specifics of the report but said the company takes feedback seriously.\n\"Siri is built in to every iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, to help our customers find what they need and get things done quickly. Many of our users talk to Siri as they would a friend and sometimes that means asking for support or advice. For support in emergency situations, Siri can dial 911, find the closest hospital, recommend an appropriate hotline or suggest local services, and with 'Hey Siri' customers can initiate these services without even touching iPhone.\"\nA Microsoft representative said the company looked forward to seeing the full report for areas of potential improvement.\n\"Cortana is designed to be a personal digital assistant focused on helping you be more productive. Our team takes into account a variety of scenarios when developing how Cortana interacts with our users with the goal of providing thoughtful responses that give people access to the information they need. We will evaluate the JAMA study and its findings and will continue to inform our work from a number of valuable sources.\"\nThere's no easy solution to the question of what Siri should say in crises, the study's authors said. For now, collaboration among key stakeholders seems to be the best first step, Linos said.\n\"I'd love them to hire more psychologists and psychiatrists to think through what is the right response: What are the priorities and how do you balance the right issues involved and respect privacy and be able to prioritize?\" Linos said. \nIn an acute crisis, the ideal response would validate the person's feelings and leave it up to him or her to decide what to do, said Emily Rothman, associate professor with the Boston University School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.\n\"As technology becomes more sophisticated and people start to use their phones interactively for an increasing number of daily tasks, it would not be surprising if they also increasingly turned to electronic devices for help with personal, health and safety issues,\" she said.\n\"The phone user needs to retain the power to choose what happens. Every domestic violence and sexual assault situation is different, and the phone won't know if the abuser suddenly re-enters the room, grabs the phone, or starts listening in. It's tempting to say that the phone should automatically dial 911, but that could lead to an increase in the number of accidental calls, limit emergency services' capacity to respond to actual urgent calls, and worst of all might tip off the perpetrator that his or her victim is trying to get help,\" she said.\nIt's still important to recognize, respect and refer, even If the person does not want to call law enforcement or if it is not an emergency situation, Rothman said. A possible example could go something like this: \"Everyone deserves to be safe. I care about your safety and I want to help. Do you want to call either of these hotlines?\" ", "Indicted surgical tech tests positive for HIV": "Rocky Allen, whose indictment in February \nled Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, Colorado, to warn 3,000 patients that they could have been exposed to HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B, consented to the release of the test results, officials said. \nHe tested negative for hepatitis C and hepatitis B and so far none of the 2,500 patients who took up the hospital's offer of free testing has shown any sign of transmission of HIV, but officials warn that approximately 500 patients did not show up for followup tests and another 500 did not receive tests. \nColorado health officials say even though no transmissions have been reported,  they want everyone who had surgery at the hospital from August 17, 2015, to January 22, 2016, to get the test. \n\"The absence of such evidence is not proof that no disease transmission occurred, because not all notified patients chose to be tested,\" said Dr. Larry Wolk, chief medical officer with the Colorado Department of Public Health. \nAllen, 28, is facing charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit. \nAccording to state regulators, Allen removed a syringe containing the pain medication fentanyl from an anesthesia cart and replaced it with another labeled syringe on January 22. Prosecutors say the replacement syringe contained another substance.\nIn March, five more hospitals in four states -- Colorado, Arizona, California and Washington -- where Allen had once worked also \nnotified patients of possible exposure to HIV and urged them to get tested.  \nAllen has pleaded not guilty in federal court in Colorado. The case is set to go to trial in August. ", "Soccer icon Brandi Chastain donating brain for CTE research": "The degenerative brain disease can result in Alzheimer's-like symptoms such as memory loss, rage and mood swings. Scientists believe CTE occurs when repeated hits to the head lead to a buildup of the abnormal protein called tau in the brain. \nAfter scoring the winning shootout goal in the 1999 Women's World Cup finale against China, Chastain was immortalized in a photo as she fell to her knees, whipped off her shirt, and clenched her fists in excitement. The photo was voted Sports Illustrated's\n second most iconic cover of all time\n. Many consider it the greatest moment in U.S. women's sports. \nIn a statement, the two-time Women's World Cup champion said she hoped her donation would change soccer for the better. \"I hope my experience in soccer and what I am able to give back helps put soccer in a better place than it was when I started.\"\n\"Having played soccer since I was little, I can't even attempt a guess at how many times I've headed the ball. It's a significant number. It's scary to think about all the heading and potential concussions that were never diagnosed in my life, but it's better to know.\" \nA 2013 study\n found that players who frequently headed the ball had brain abnormalities similar to people who suffered from concussions. The study found that soccer players headed the ball six to 12 times per game, while the ball was traveling 50 mph or faster. Players likely headed the ball 30 or more times during every practice. \nHeading is responsible for nearly a third of all concussions reported in youth soccer, and female athletes may be more at risk. \nA 2015 analysis\n of 100 U.S. high schools found that girls were more than 1.5 times more likely than boys to experience a concussion.\nToday, the 47-year-old mother continues to coach soccer at her alma mater, Santa Clara University.\nIn a \n2012 interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta\n, Chastain said that she works hard to teach her players how to avoid concussions by being aware of where they are on the field. \"Part of it for me is not so much about hitting the ball. It's more about how fast is an opponent coming, where is your body in space? How do you protect yourself?\" said Chastain. \n\"How do you protect yourself in space so you might not have that headfirst collision?\" she added. \"We teach the players about their spatial awareness when other people are kind of trying to infiltrate their space.\" \nChastain has also been heavily involved in the Safer Soccer campaign, aimed at eliminating heading in soccer for kids under the age of 14. \nLast November\n, U.S. Soccer prohibited headers for children under 11, limiting the move to players between the ages of 11 and 13. ", "Scott Kelly answers your questions about life in space, missing to Mars": "\"The most overwhelming part of it is gravity itself and I still haven't gotten over it completely,\" Kelly told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta during a live Facebook chat Monday night. \nAlthough Kelly announced that he will be \nretiring from NASA\n, he said he is still dedicated to the formal data collection process of the Twin Study, which is an ongoing look at the effects on Kelly after a year in space, versus that of his twin brother, Mark, who remained on Earth. And while he doesn't miss living \"in constant noise\" with fans, pumps and motors constantly whirring in the background on the International Space Station, Kelly seems in awe of the incredible experience he was able to have in his \"second home.\"\nAnd the surprising thing that made the return trip home? His glasses. \"These are the glasses that launched with me and I never lost them in space,\" Kelly said, referring to the lenses he wore during the chat. \"This is more of a miracle because stuff just floats away up there.\"\nKelly also believes that the space station is proof that we can do anything. \"That space station is such a complicated facility and was so difficult to build and such an achievement. If we put our minds to it, we can achieve anything we want, whether that's curing cancer or going to Mars, we can do it, we just have to put the resources behind it.\"\nKelly answered questions for nearly an hour. Here are some of them. Some of them have been edited for clarity or brevity. \nHow are you feeling?\n I felt significantly different coming back. Initially, I felt better coming out of the Soyuz. Maybe it was adrenaline or that I had experienced that once before. After that, I felt much different. My legs have had kind of a negative reaction to gravity and it's kind of shocking how for the first couple of weeks my legs were swollen, sore, the joints, my muscles, and when I stood up at night I could tell my whole cardiovascular system wasn't used to keeping the blood out of my legs. Its like when you turn upside down on the monkey bars and feel the rush of blood to your head. It was the same way with my legs and I could feel them swell up and it was kind of alarming. But I'm slowly getting better, but I still get up very slowly. I'm not really able to run yet. I think I'm already improving and will over time. \nWhat was happening to your legs to cause you pain?\n Being in space for so long, your cardiovascular system doesn't have to keep the blood from pooling in your legs due to gravity when you're standing up -- that's why your head gets swollen when you're in space. Over the course of the first several months you're there, you lose fluid. Now you have gravity pushing all of that fluid back into your legs. I think the muscles in your cardiovascular system aren't able to physically adjust the pressure like they do when you live in gravity all of the time. \nWhat are your thoughts on Mars? If you were asked to be that guy who goes to Mars, what would you say now?\n A couple of weeks ago, I would've said I'm not that interested in Mars, but now I am probably more interested. If we go to Mars and we land on Mars and we stay on Mars, we can experience Martian gravity and don't have an ultra-long time in microgravity, which I think is helpful. I think where we run into issues is flying around Mars and coming back, because then you have guys in space for a year and a half. I wouldn't say you can't but I would say that's pretty significant based on my experience.\nMy first flight was seven days, my second 13, my third 159,  my fourth 340. If I had to graph how I felt, it's a linear of things. You add another couple hundred days, and if I felt 50% worse than how I feel now, that would be pretty hard to get around when I got back. There were a couple of nights there after I got back that I felt so bad that had I not spent a year in space, I would have gone to the emergency room. It was a combination of every place my skin was touching was inflamed, legs were so sore it was hard to get out of bed, and it was almost that delirious feeling you get when you have the flu, too. \nWhat scared you the most while in space and what did you do to overcome that fear?\n The thing I've always feared the most is not my own personal safety but the safety of my kids, people you love on the ground and something bad happening to them and you not being able to do anything about that. I experienced that on my last flight with my sister-in-law Gabby Giffords being shot, and having had that experience once, I know how difficult it is to deal with a situation like that where no matter what, you cannot be there. There are only a handful of things that will allow you to leave the space station, and all of them have to do with the space station -- none are on Earth. It's because of a fire, depressurization or a medical emergency for one of the crew members. No matter what happens to your kids and loved ones, you are not coming home. \nWhat is it like leaving the space station and landing on Earth?\n This place is your home and I respected the achievement that is the space station. When I was leaving, I knew I would most likely never see it again, so that's kind of bittersweet. Backing away in the Soyuz, I was thinking how having lived there so long, how this is the hardest thing we've ever done, it was harder than going to the moon, building this facility that has this incredible amount of potential and it really struck me, I felt privileged to be a part of it. \nI've always struggled explaining how small the Soyuz is that you come back in and it dawned on me that the way I  can explain it: As small as it can be, you can actually fit three people in it. It's tiny. It is the brute force method of getting back from space. You go from 17,500 mph to basically losing all of that speed in 5-10 minutes when you're bleeding all of that energy. It's like going over Niagara Falls in a barrel but while you're on fire. And when you realize it's not going to kill you, it's the most fun you've ever had. \nWhat are the advantages to doing experiments on the space station?\n It's microgravity. The only way on Earth you can do is put something in a centrifuge and increase the gravity component. In microgravity, we have something we cannot do on Earth. You can do it in an airplane for 20 seconds in a parabolic flight or drop something off a tower and experience it for a short amount of time, but the environment of the space station provides the ability to change that and whether it's combustion technology or how cells might grow in a bioreactor or protein crystals, a variable that you can make nearly zero that, on Earth you don't have the capability of doing that. So you can learn different things by controlling that on the space station. \nDo you get colds and flu on the ISS, or are you protected due to the isolation?\n A lot of people get congested, but it's not because of virus or bacteria, part of it's a fluid shift or part of it is like an allergen, but not like cold or flu. Your skin cells are floating around and other people's skin cells and we have a  good ventilation system that draws that in but, on Earth you would never be breathing in someone else's skin cells that come off their body. Also the CO2 on board is 10 times higher than what it is on Earth. One of the ways myself and others react to that is some pretty significant congestion, headaches, in my case, it irritates my eyes. I wouldn't want to live forever in that kind of CO2 environment. When it gets up around 3.8 millimeters of mercury, it can affect your cognitive ability as well. It's definitely something to emphasize for future vehicles. \nMentally, how did you cope being up there so long?\n  A year is a long time to be up there. I was lucky in that I had flown before for 159 days and knew how to pace myself. I think in some ways being the first person to spend this amount of time up there adds that excitement value. It made the time go by a little easier. In June, I had been up there for a few months, and I thought, \"Wow I will be there until next March.\" It's hard to get your head around. It's an amazing space station, but you cannot leave. It's like being at work in the office for a really long time. \nMars or the moon? Where should we go next and why\n? I think there is a lot to still be learned from going to the moon and it's a great place to develop and test out your technology for going to Mars, it's almost like it's designed perfectly to do that. It's closer, it's smaller from a gravity perspective, it has no atmosphere so you don't have to deal with the issues of the Martian atmosphere. But the problem with it though is that it's expensive, and we don't have an unlimited amount of money. In a perfect world, you would use the moon as a way to test systems, technology and procedures before you go to Mars, but we have other priorities. But maybe it makes sense to the people who make these decisions that going to Mars first without going back to moon is a better way to do it. \nWhat do you miss seeing the most from the ISS? \nI miss the guys I was up there with, especially the three that are up there now. As the more experienced one, you're nurturing them along, and when you leave it kind of feels like you're abandoning them. And the overall mission of doing something that is incredibly difficult and challenging. I miss looking out at the Earth but  I realized I had looked out at the Earth a lot when I opened the window shade in the cupola and saw this spot of sand and I could tell just by the color and texture instantly that it was this area just north of Mogadishu in Somalia and I'm thinking, this is how you know it is time to go home.", "Dishwasher lost 100 pounds by eating on the job": "Editor's note: Do you have a story of a turning point when you made a change for better health? \nShare your story with CNN iReport\n and you could be featured.\n\"They had to lift me out of the pool,\" he said. \"Hundreds of people were watching.\"\nWeaver described himself at that time as shy, overweight and fed up with his lifestyle. At his heaviest, Weaver tipped the scale at 289 pounds and stands at 6-foot-2.\n\"I was a huge guy,\" he said.\nThat was four years ago. \nNow, Weaver has a completely different life. Underneath his once timid and overweight exterior, he discovered a confident, strong guy.\nHis quest to health wasn't easy. Shortly before the accident, he was enrolled in community college, earning a perfect 4.0 GPA his first semester. But his fall derailed him. \nWeaver had to undergo knee-replacement surgery in 2012, which he spent several months waiting on for insurance reasons. He was depressed and discouraged but his luck took a turn shortly after his recovery. He landed a job as a dishwasher at a restaurant chain serving soups, salads and pasta in Chula Vista, California. Weaver slowly began to incorporate healthier foods into his meals at work and was inspired to make better food choices at home and eating out. His diet began consisting of soup, salad, rice and cornbread but mainly raw fruits and vegetables. \nFrom heroin-fueled bank robber to family man\nAccording to the USDA's 2015 Dietary Guidelines Report, obesity with a \"nutritional origin\" is highly prevalent among people in the United States. A majority of the population has a low intake of key food groups such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\nBy consuming foods with higher nutritional value and exercising regularly, Weaver dropped more than 100 pounds within a span of a year. He loves to ride bikes, hike and run on the beach.\nWith his weight-loss came confidence and energy. Weaver has already been promoted several times at Souplantation, climbing from a waged employee to a salaried service manager in just two years. He's due for another promotion in June.\n\"He motivates his team through relentless improvement,\" said Josh Clarke, Weaver's boss. \"The energy he brings to work on a daily basis is contagious.\"\nWeaver has maintained a healthy weight of 189 pounds and remains faithful to his newfound habits. \"I haven't eaten at a fast food restaurant in over three years,\" he said proudly.\nHis fiancee, Lessley Torres, is a big supporter of his success and credits his change to his character and determination. \"He strives to move forward,\" she said.\nWeaver plans to continue his education, but for now, he's enjoying his life and looks forward to his promotion. \"I feel like a 100% new person,\" he said, \"my mind is clear and I try to find the positive in everything.\"\nHow a coma made me a happier person", "BPA-free plastic alternatives may not be safe as you think": "\"Our findings are frightening and important,\" said senior author and reproductive endocrinologist Nancy Wayne. \"Consider it the aquatic version of the canary in the coal mine.\"\nAfter decades of animal research linked BPA (Bisphenol A), \na known endocrine disruptor,\n to problems with brain and reproductive development, early puberty and a rise in breast and prostate cancer, many manufacturers stopped using the chemical to harden plastics, replacing it with \"BPA-free\" alternatives. The most common replacement is BPS (Bisphenol S), said Wayne.  \nWayne and her colleagues exposed zebrafish to low levels of both BPA and BPS, and looked at the impact of the chemicals on genes and brain cells that control reproduction. Zebrafish have often been used to study the impact of plastic additives because their transparent embryos allow scientists to see and monitor cell growth.\n\"Our research showed that low levels of BPS had a similar impact on the embryo as BPA,\" Wayne told CNN. \"In the presence of either BPA or BPS, embryonic development was accelerated. Additionally, BPA caused premature birth.\"\nIn addition to the effect on estrogen, the study also found both BPA and BPS affected the thyroid hormone system. \"Because of thyroid hormone's important influence on brain development during gestation,\" said Wayne, \"our work holds important implications for general embryonic and fetal development, including in humans.\"\nBPS research growing\nIn a 2013 study, Texas researchers found that as little as one part per trillion of BPS could \ninterfere with the normal functioning of a cel\nl, in some cases leading to cell death. Another study of zebrafish, out of Canada, found BPA accelerated neural cell growth by 180% for fish exposed to extremely low levels; \nit was even worse for BPS\n -- neural growth exploded 240%. As adults, the fish exposed to both chemicals showed significant signs of hyperactivity. \nAnother study,\n this time in rats\n, found BPS caused heart arrhythmia when given in doses equivalent to those humans usually experience. In a press release, study author Hong-Sheng Wang, said, \"Our findings call into question the safety of BPA-free products containing BPS.\"\n \"It's all pointing in the same direction: BPS is not harmless,\" said Wayne about the results of her study in connection with prior research. \"Consumers should be cautious about the assumption that 'BPA-free' means a product is safe.\"\n\"This is a classic case of 'regrettable substitution' in which the replacement chemical is as toxic as the chemical it was replacing,\" said Sharima Rasanayagam, director of science for the Breast Cancer Fund, which tracks environmental causes of breast cancer. \n\"The lack of transparency regarding the identity and safety of the chemicals used as BPA replacements makes it very difficult to assess the overall safety of the alternative,\" said Rasanayagam. \"It's like jumping from the frying pan into the fire.\"\nThe American Chemical Council (ACC), which represents BPA manufacturers, disagreed with the UCLA study's findings about BPA. \"Many \ngovernment bodies \naround the world have evaluated the \nscientific evidence on BPA\n and have clearly stated that BPA is safe for use,\" the ACC said in a statement provided to CNN. \"For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded recently to the question, 'Is\n BPA safe?\n' with one unambiguous word: 'Yes.' In comparison, the results of this new study on zebrafish provide little or no meaningful information to assess the safety of BPA.\"\nIn 2012, the FDA banned the use of BPA in all baby bottles, sippy cups and infant formula packaging because the manufacturers had already dropped BPA in favor of \"safer\" alternatives. The agency says it's continuing \"\nin-depth studies to answer key questions and clarify uncertainties about BPA\n\" in conjunction with the National Toxicology Program. The latest review reported by the FDA looked at more than 300 studies published between November 2009, and July 2013.\nBPA is still available in many consumer products such as water bottles, food-storage containers and plastic tableware, as well as contact lenses, eyeglass lenses, compact discs, water-supply pipes, and some dental sealants and composites. \nAccording to the Breast Cancer Fund, BPS has been found in \"things printed quickly and at high heats,\" such as body wash, hair care products, makeup, lotions and toothpaste, as well as some paper products such as flyers, tickets, mailing envelopes, airplane boarding passes and thermal receipts.\nThe Breast Cancer Fund recommends that consumers wishing to limit exposure to possible toxins in BPA, BPS and other alternatives use glass, stainless steel and food safe ceramic containers for food and water storage. They stress that it's not safe to microwave in plastic. Other suggestions include using gloves to handle thermal paper receipts, and researching canned goods to find those that no longer use plastic liners. \nFollow CNN Health on \nFacebook\n and \nTwitter.", "How a cat helps this 6-year-old artist with autism": "When Iris is painting outside, Thula is always nearby, exploring in the garden. They play with the same toys in their fairy-tale-like playroom, take baths together, learn new things together, go on adventures and fall asleep together after long, exciting days.\nThey sound like sisters. And while the two best friends are like family, there is one striking difference: Thula is a Maine Coon cat and Iris is a child with autism, diagnosed at age 2. Together they prove what Iris' mom, Arabella Carter-Johnson, has always believed: \"different is brilliant.\" \nPainting a connection\nBefore Thula came into their lives, Carter-Johnson and her husband, Peter-Jon Halmshaw, went through a \"dark time\" trying to figure out the best ways to draw Iris out after her diagnosis four years ago. \nIris' severe form of autism was marked by irregular sleep patterns, obsessive behavior, refusing to make eye contact, avoiding playing with her parents or other children, and feeling distressed around people she didn't know. She also had a tendency to disappear into books without wanting to engage with anything around her and didn't speak or communicate. \nCarter-Johnson and her husband reached out to therapists and researched everything they could. It quickly became apparent to them after a \"disastrous time in Pre-K\" that educating Iris from home might be the best environment for her. Because Carter-Johnson wanted to recreate the same type of activities that Iris would be experiencing in school, she added painting to the curriculum. Occupational therapy was also helping Iris.\nCarter-Johnson, a professional photographer, has a propensity to draw or doodle. And one day that habit helped her connect with her daughter, which she was so eager to do.\n \nIris walked up and placed her small hand on her mother's hand, as though asking her to draw more. \nWhen Carter-Johnson introduced Iris to painting at age 3, she was hopeful to see her daughter so excited and happy over an activity. Iris would come up to her mother and indicate that she wanted more paint. Because they used a lot of water colors, Iris even began mixing her own. \n\"She looked at me and wouldn't push me away,\" Carter-Johnson said. \"It was a way for us to connect.\"\nThe perfect companion\nThrough her research, Carter-Johnson discovered that many children responded well to a variety of animals, from dogs to horses. They tried those two first, but Iris didn't connect. When her brother traveled to Sweden for Christmas and needed someone to cat-sit, Carter-Johnson agreed but was worried about how Iris and the cat would get along, especially since Iris was sick at the time. Instead, she was surprised to see the way they bonded. \nThat's when Carter-Johnson decided to reassess her assumption that cats were aloof companions. She posted on Facebook asking about the most suitable breeds, and many people pointed her to the Maine Coon. Living in Leicester, England, Carter-Johnson was unfamiliar with what is one of the largest types of cats native to the U.S. But she was excited to learn that they were friendly, intelligent, quirky, vocal and even fond of water. \nWhen they brought Thula (pronounced Toola) home from a local breeder, the fluffy kitten slept cradled in Iris' arms the first night. Iris seemed to relax around Thula, stroking her ears and whiskers, and the cat didn't even mind when Iris held her tail. \n\"Thula loved all of the things that Iris found difficult,\" Carter-Johnson said. \"It was like heaven.\"\nBecause Iris hated the sensation of things touching her skin, like clothing or water, getting dressed or taking a bath could be incredibly difficult. But as a water-loving breed, Thula hopped right in the bathtub. Soon, Iris began to take all of her baths accompanied by the kitten. And three months after Thula's arrival, Iris was fine with wearing tops and layers. \nAround Iris' parents, Thula was a playful, and at times mischievous, kitten. But she seemed to know what Iris needed, adapting her behavior and becoming the perfect companion. If Iris became impatient in the car, Thula would walk over and sit on her lap to calm her down. If she had difficulty during the day or woke up at night, Thula would distract her until she had settled again. \nNot long after Thula's arrival, Iris began to speak to her. She would say \"sit, cat\" and Thula would obey. Iris would follow Thula around the house, saying \"more cat.\" There was no pressure or judgment from Thula, unlike how Iris might feel if she was talking to another child or adult, so Iris would talk to Thula and give her instructions. In addition to helping with Iris' speech therapy, Thula also studied Iris' movements as she played or painted, mimicking them, and in turn, encouraging Iris to continue.\n\"It's beautiful watching this,\" Carter-Johnson said. \"We're her parents and educators. It's calming to know that she has her little buddy, and someone other than just us.\"\nThula would also accompany them outside, where Iris seemed to learn the best because she was away from indoor sensory distractions such as artificial noise and light. With her cat and her outdoor painting, Iris began to blossom right before Carter-Johnson's eyes.\nPassion projects and progress\nAround the same time as Thula's arrival, Iris was introduced to classical music and the violin. She has had music therapy every week since the age of 3, and even though she doesn't like to play the violin, she enjoys holding and strumming it. Although Iris has been known to become impatient just from sitting in a car, she will sit through a two-hour concert at the orchestra absolutely riveted by the sounds. Carter-Johnson could also see the way that music inspired her painting. They decided to start pairing music with other activities, which encouraged Iris to pursue them. \nCarter-Johnson and her husband also began \nThe Little Explorers Activity Club\n, an autism-friendly group for children to experience new things outside their home. It gave Iris and other children with autism in the community a chance to be around one another while engaging with their interests, from cooking and science to music and history. \nCarter-Johnson used this idea of working with Iris' interests and letting her lead rather than be coerced which she learned from\n \nreading books like Rupert Isaacson's \"\nThe Horse Boy\n\" and Kristine Barnett's \"\nThe Spark\n\" that promoted the idea of \nNaturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions\n. They also discovered the \nGemiini video platform,\n which helps Iris with speech therapy. \nOver the last few years, Iris has become famous for her Monet-like paintings. Even celebrities like Angelina Jolie have purchased her artwork. Carter-Johnson credits Iris' intense concentration with her ability to blend colors and patterns so well. She creates her unique paintings by dotting, dabbing and flicking the brush. \nThe extraordinary art of autistic '5-year-old Monet'\nBeing able to interact with others online who are fascinated by Iris' story and her artwork has been incredible for her education and confidence, Carter-Johnson said. \nIris loves looking at and helping select the photos her mother posts to their Facebook page, as well as watching videos of her and Thula and hearing from \"friends\" that like her artwork. Carter-Johnson also uses the postcards she receives from around the world to teach Iris geography. And now, \nIris has her very own book\n that shares the story of her and Thula's special bond. It is a time capsule that Carter-Johnson hopes her daughter will look back on fondly when she's older. \nWhile Thula and Iris are still best friends, the two have grown more independent from each other\n \nover the past year because Thula seems to realize that she's needed less now. But she's always around, whether propped up in a basket on the front of a bicycle or getting her own passport when the family travels to Amsterdam later this year. \nWhile Carter-Johnson knows that they still have a ways to go with improving Iris' speech and communication\n,\n she is thrilled with her daughter's progress. Iris is better at making eye contact and socializing more with others. Speech therapy is helping her to remember to say \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" when she meets people, as well as describing her day to her parents. She also still receives occupational therapy, music therapy and has had luck with doing yoga as well.\n\"I'm hopeful for more improvements,\" Carter-Johnson said. \"One day, I want her to be able to get a job and live independently, and we will try our absolute best to make that happen. Autism doesn't have to be this grim diagnosis -- it's seeing the brilliance in differences and embracing those.\" ", "Your food labels are going to look a lot different": "First lady Michelle Obama made the announcement about the FDA-approved revamp of the labels today. The new labels should make it easier for you to see how many calories you are eating, with a bolder font. Manufacturers will also have to list how much added sugar is in the food you are buying.\nThe labels should also make it clearer what a serving size is and will define \"serving size\" to fit better with the amount a person currently eats. \nThe nutrition labels haven't changed significantly in two decades. Unlike dietary guidelines that must be re-examined every five years, there is no legal requirement to revisit the science behind these labels. \nNutrients will also get a makeover. The new labels will prioritize what Americans need more of, such as potassium and Vitamin D. Studies show that Americans don't get enough of either in their diets. Products will also have to say how much calcium and iron are inside, but Vitamins C and A are out. That's because deficiencies in those vitamins are now rare, according to the Food and Drug Administration. \nSupplement labels will also be updated to reflect the changes.  \nMost food makers have two years to add the new labels to their products. Smaller manufacturers, those that have less than $10 million in sales, get an extra year to update their labels.\nThe majority of Americans do look at labels when they shop. According to government research, about 77% of U.S. adults say they do.\nThe FDA said the label change is a \"major step.\" With \nmore than two-thirds of adults considered overweight or obese\n, the ease of access to nutrition information could help.\n\"The updated label makes improvements to this valuable resource so consumers can make more informed food choices,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement today. Making better choices is \"one of the most important steps a person can take to reduce the risk of heart disease and obesity.\"", "Inside one of the world's largest sperm banks": "Before her two-day assignment to shoot there, photographer \nLaerke Posselt\n had never been inside one. She hadn't thought much about them at all, she said.\n\"That's one of the amazing things about our job,\" Posselt said. \"Suddenly, we're at a sperm bank, a place I hadn't imagined I would go.\" \nCryos International has sent vials of sperm to more than 80 countries, and more than 27,000 babies have been born from its donors. Donors are paid from $15 to $76 per \"donation,\" and the vials can sell from $45 to $1,137, depending on potency and donor profiles, \nCNNMoney reported in October.\nIt's a big business, but it still feels a little secretive, Posselt said. If people in Aarhus know it's there, they don't seem to talk about it. \nBut in the Cryos International office, there wasn't a trace of awkwardness between the workers and the donors. It's an office filled with professionals doing their jobs, Posselt said. \nThe sperm bank's founder, Ole Schou, even wore a silver spermatozoon lapel pin as he posed for a portrait.\n\"For them, it's such an everyday thing and they're just handling this sperm,\" Posselt said. \"It's something we connect to something very intimate, but it was their whole work life.\"\nThe sperm bank is clean and modern. There are images on the walls of bright-eyed babies. In donation rooms inside, the wall art instead focuses on the backsides of long-legged women and the curves of cleavage.\nFor most offices, it would seem like a stark juxtaposition. But when the business is creating human lives, Posselt said, it seems to be an appropriate reminder that sex can lead to babies.\n\"It's two different worlds, but it's pretty much the same,\" Posselt said. \"The setting is just different.\"\nPosselt said she remains interested in shooting families with different structures, including portraits of parents who conceived their children with the help of sperm banks. She's seen the science behind it, she said. Now, she would like to meet the mothers, fathers and children and hear their stories.\n\"It was interesting to think of all these lives that potentially are in there and they're sending it all out to different parts of the world,\" Posselt said. \"Just imagining this will potentially be a lot of small children running around.\"", "After gorilla shooting, are zoos becoming 'obsolete'?": "But another question emerged among parents, too: Should we be going to zoos at all?\nThe animal advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said there's a problem with the larger concept of zoos. It said on Twitter that the tragic episode in Cincinnati was the latest proof that \"even under the 'best' circumstances ... captivity is never acceptable for gorillas or other primates.\"\nChange is already happening around the globe, PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange said this year after SeaWorld made the\n stunning announcement that it's moving away from housing killer whales\n and ending its breeding program. SeaWorld faced growing pressure about its orca policies and then declining park attendance after the release of \"\nBlackfish\n,\" which documented the \n2010 death of a trainer\n pulled underwater by a 12,000-pound orca. The current generation of killer whales will be the last orcas housed in captivity at the park, SeaWorld said\n \"What we're seeing is the 'Blackfish' effect,\" Lange said. \"The public has completely changed its opinion on exploiting and killing animals for entertainment.\n\"The writing's on the wall. A corporation like SeaWorld only changes because it's financially prudent to do so, and it's financially prudent to do so because people just aren't going, and their stocks are falling.\"\nLange also pointed to Mexico, which has banned animal circuses; Spain, where a number of cities have banned bullfighting; and the United States, where cities such as Los Angeles and Oakland, California, have banned the use of the bullhook, a tool used to handle and train elephants.\nThose moves were the \"beginning of the end\" for a Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus tradition, said Lange. The circus \nannounced in January that starting in May, a year and a half earlier than expected, it would no longer tour with elephants.\n The elephants will be taken to the Ringling Bros. Center for Elephant Conservation in rural Central Florida.\n'Impossible situations'\nNow, some animal-rights activists and parents are questioning whether zoos, aquariums and circuses should dramatically scale back when it comes to the animals they currently keep in captivity. \nPilar Clark, a freelance writer and founder of \nOne Mom Media, \nhad said for years that she wouldn't support SeaWorld or other ventures where animals were used as entertainment. Still, the family loved the local zoo, with its meerkats and naked mole rats. \nBut this year, the family decided against renewing its zoo membership. \n\"It becomes kind of a complicated question of what is ethical and what isn't. 'Do the animals ever get to do anything? Do they get bored?' Now that they're older, they're coming up with these questions,\" Clark said of her children, ages 7 and 10. \"The more they bring up these conversations organically, the more I see the values we instilled in them about wildlife.\"\nWhile SeaWorld's announcement this year had her \"clapping out loud\" in her living room, she said, she still admires the conservation work that zoos do, especially considering poaching, pollution, development and other disasters that threaten species. She feels for the keepers who worked with Harambe, the gorilla who was killed. She empathizes too with the mother and child who was injured.\n\"It's one of those impossible situations,\" she said. \"There are really no winners.\"\nAlthough her family will still go to the zoo -- she recently chaperoned a field trip there, for example -- she would like for them to be more transparent about their missions. Already, she said, they're becoming \"obsolete.\"\n\"You get into strange, gray territory,\" Clark said. \"I don't think we need them the way people did.\"\nParents 'conflicted' about taking kids to zoos \nWhen I reached out to parents on Facebook for reaction to SeaWorld's decision this year, I heard plenty of support but also differing attitudes about removing animals from circuses and limiting the number of animals in captivity in\n \nzoos.\nTricia Kenney, a mother of two girls ages 11 and 15, said her daughters wrote school papers a few years ago on why SeaWorld should close but not zoos and aquariums, she said via Facebook. They \"feel that zoos and aquariums, for the most part, try to re-create a natural environment for the animals and, more importantly, don't disrespect them by having them perform all day long and do things that are completely unnatural for them,\" she said.\n\"They feel that zoos respect the animals, take good care of them and let them be,\" said Kenney, a communication consultant for the anti-smoking \n\"Truth\" campaign\n. She added that they've never been to the circus because her girls feel that circuses exploit animals, too.\nWhit Honea, co-founder of \nDads4Change.com \nand a father of two boys ages 10 and 12, said they generally don't attend circuses because of the \"abusive treatment\" of the animals. They don't go to a lot of aquariums or zoos either, but when they do, they try to make sure those facilities are responsible in their animal care and provide rescue and/or other beneficial services on behalf of the animals in captivity, he said.\n\"That said, it's tough not to give the kids the chance to see amazing animals in real life, and there have been times when doing so has made us feel like hypocrites,\" said Honea, who is also author of \n\"The Parents' Phrase Book.\"\n\"We treat each visit as a learning opportunity and would love for every zoo and aquarium to focus its entertainment value in education rather than the bells and whistles of cruelty,\" he said. \"I have high hopes that SeaWorld's new direction will make that practice commercially viable.\"\nJanis Brett Elspas of Los Angeles, who took her four kids to SeaWorld whenever she could as they were growing up, said she was sad to hear the SeaWorld news. Seeing the Shamu show has always been one of her favorite things to do at the park. \nI \ninterviewed Elspas\n, founder of the blog \nMommy Blog Expert,\n as \"Blackfish\" was set to air on CNN. Back then, she said that places like SeaWorld provide crucial education to children about whales.\nToday, she feels the same way but is somewhat conflicted, she says. On the one hand, she feels it's important for the public to be able to experience nature up close. \"Videos and photos of animals just don't have the same effect as seeing them,\" she said via email. But on the other hand, as an animal lover, she feels for the animals being free to roam in their natural habitat and not in captivity.\n\"Perhaps it's possible to meet halfway: increase the quality of life in captivity, while keeping fewer animals so people can still see and experience them, while allowing more animals to roam free,\" she said.\nBut plenty of parents also feel like Laurie Marshall, a mom of two, who said earlier this year that she has no plans to stop taking her kids to circuses, zoos and aquariums. Marshall, whose kids are 6 and almost 10, said it was \"startling\" when you see \"how big these creatures are and how small the tanks are.\" Still, her SeaWorld experience didn't change her mind about bringing her kids to places where they can see animals up close.\n\"First, I do not think it is OK to keep animals in a contained habitat if it hampers their lifestyle,\" said Marshall, the founder and president of the \nMarshall Law Group\n. \"But, I am not the type to boycott any of the places above, as I don't believe my sacrifice is going to make a difference and it would deprive my kids of their enjoyment.\"\nAre you thinking twice about going to zoos, aquariums and circuses? Share your thoughts with \nKelly Wallace on Twitter @kellywallacetv\n.", "The benefits of yoga in schools": "Most recently, the issue was raised by parents in Georgia whose children attend an elementary school that implemented yoga in the classroom. Although yoga is not a religion in and of itself, it is a philosophy, rooted in Hinduism, composed of a system of various practices designed to heighten spirituality. \nHowever, what the concerned parents probably don't realize is that the popular Americanized version of yoga being taught in schools is a secular form of mind-body exercise focused on mental and physical benefits, not spirituality.\nIn 2013, a judge in Encinitas, California, \nruled against a suit\n initiated by parents seeking to end a yoga program at their children's school, stating that the school was not teaching religion through its yoga classes.   \nI agree with the judge. When children do yoga, they aren't practicing religion; they are training life-enhancing abilities that can positively impact every child, regardless of faith. According to \na 2012 study published\n in The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research, middle-school students taking yoga reported positive mood and attitude changes, increased energy and improved ability to relax, as well as improved posture.\nAs a mother who has done yoga with all three of my children, the youngest of whom is on the autism spectrum, I can attest to the myriad benefits, ranging from physical advantages like improved sport performance and posture to profoundly valuable mental skills like self-control and the ability to manage stress. \nBelow, I've outlined my top three reasons why and ways how yoga should be taught in schools. Although the exercises I've shared are most appropriate for preschool through preteen, yoga-based practices for better breathing, movement and mindfulness can and should be adapted for any age group. \nTeaching breathing as fundamental to well-being\nEveryone agrees that breathing is fundamental to life. No breathing, no living. However, how to breathe to the best of our ability is rarely, if ever, taught to any of us, despite the fact that, through exposure to illness or stress, most of us develop less-than-optimal breathing patterns that can adversely affect our overall well-being. How we breathe not only \naffects our movement and posture\n, it is crucial to \nour ability to manage stress\n.  \nWhen I work with pro athletes on breathing and they quickly realize the significant benefits, their first response is usually to ask, \"Why didn't anyone teach me this sooner?!\" I understand their frustration. That's why I've developed the following exercises to teach children the basics of breathing biomechanics and how to leverage their breathing during times of stress.\n\"Rib riding\" diaphragmatic breathing\n: Teaches and reinforces proper breathing biomechanics\nHave kids sit comfortably on the floor or in chairs and place their hands on their lower ribs. Ask them to breathe in and out through their noses while their hands \"ride\" the corresponding movement of their ribs. Explain that inhalations should fill their lungs, like balloons under their ribs, making their hands expand out with their ribcage. When they exhale, the balloons deflate, and their hands should ride their ribs back in and down. Repeat in sets of five breaths three times.\nPeace palm exhaling\n: Reduces stress; helps kids manage sensory and/or emotionally overwhelming experiences\nI developed this exercise specifically for my son with Asperger's syndrome. It's very effective for children prone to panic attacks or tantrums. By practicing regularly, children can learn do it on their own when facing an overwhelming episode.\nFrom sitting or standing, position your open palm about 6 inches in front of the child's face. Ask the child to blow into your hand while you count. The goal is to get to an eight count (or longer) exhale at least five times in a row, which will stop hyperventilation and stimulate the parasympathetic (rest and restore) nervous system to decrease heart rate, blood pressure and stress hormone production. Be patient and encouraging.\nHelping kids move with control and confidence\nUnfortunately, physical education classes in school are increasingly limited, despite the fact that more than a third of American children are overweight or obese, and most time in school is spent being sedentary. In response, some schools are instituting standing desks and placing more emphasis on athletics. Unfortunately, the \"education\" aspect is still lost in those initiatives. And, since not all children are athletes, a sports focus can be intimidating for some.\nGray Cook, a renowned physical therapist, author and founder of \nFunctional Movement Systems\n, is a firm believer in teaching \"movement literacy.\"  As such, when it comes to yoga in schools, Cook is a big proponent. \n\"Yoga doesn't discriminate,\" Cook said. \"Whether an athlete or not, everyone is equally matched in their own bodies during a yoga practice, where the focus is internal. It teaches kids that their physical presence is about more than their ability to compete.\"\nWith kids being bombarded on social media with warped messages about body image, there is immense value in a practice that cultivates self-control and respect for your body. Additionally, growing bodies benefit from training their proprioceptive systems for better balance and movement. That's why I like to change up traditionally static yoga poses for kids by adding moving parts, like these examples: \nHappy hopping tree balance: \nStrengthens muscles while enhancing proprioception for better balance, coordination and movement control; promotes smiling\nDirect children to balance on one leg with their other foot pressed into the inside of their standing leg, either below or above their knee joint. Don't let them press directly into the side of their knee. Then ask them to reach their arms up or out, like branches, and smile. Once they feel balanced, they can try taking three hops in place, forward and backward. \nDog at the fire hydrant: \nStrengthens muscles while enhancing proprioception for better balance, coordination and movement control\nFrom hands and knees, have children straighten their legs to push their tailbones up to make an A-frame shape known as downward-facing dog pose in yoga. Tell the kids they can keep their legs bent, if straightening is difficult. Ask them if they've ever seen a dog lifting one leg at a fire hydrant to relieve itself. Tell them they are all dogs who who have had very big drinks of water, so they need to lift and hold one leg up for a count of 10. Giggling usually ensues, which adds to the balance challenge. Ask them to switch legs for another count of 10. You can decrease or increase the count, depending on age and skill.\nPromoting the power of mindfulness\nIn a culture of constant technological stimulation, it's important to teach kids the power of mindfulness. And, with teenagers being the \nmost stressed group of people\n in the United States when school is in session, learning stress-management techniques is essential.  A high school in Marblehead, Massachusetts, is seeing the benefits of a \nmindfulness meditation initiative\n it began last year, with many students reporting feeling less anxious and more relaxed. \nMindfulness meditation does not need to be time-consuming or complicated. It's as easy as closing your eyes for a moment and focusing on the sensations of your breath or simply directing your attention to the farthest sounds you can perceive. The exercises below are designed to introduce mindfulness to a younger audience by engaging them in an entertaining visualization that utilizes their imagination to stimulate their senses, before bringing them back to simply tuning in to their breathing in the present moment.\nButterfly flight visualization\n: Promotes imagination, reduces stress, increases mindfulness\nHave children sit on the floor with the soles of their feet together and knees bent out in traditional yoga cobbler's pose, also known as butterfly. Ask them to close their eyes and envision themselves as butterflies, with their bent legs acting as wings in whatever colors they choose. Once they have that image, ask them to begin slowly flapping their wings and imagine being airborne. Have them picture a flower on a bush or tree that they will fly to and land on gently. Direct them to land on and take flight from several flowers, objects, etc. before returning to the ground. Repeat each directive, pausing between instructions to provide processing time. At the conclusion, ask them to return back to their human bodies and tune in to the sensations of their breathing.\nMagic carpet meditation\n: Promotes imagination, reduces stress, increases mindfulness\nWith children lying on mats or blankets, tell them to close their eyes and relax their bodies, while imagining their mats or blankets transform into \"magic carpets.\" Because magic carpets can travel anywhere in the world, direct them to pick a destination to fly over during the meditation, like the ocean or Disney World. As they \"feel\" their carpets begin to rise slowly off the floor, they can hold the sides to steady and steer them. Tell them that it takes only one minute to fly through a blue sky and clouds to get there. After a moment, inform them that they are floating above their destination, so they can imagine everything they see, smell, hear and feel. Provide cues by asking questions like, \"Is it warm or cold?\" and \"What can you hear?\" Give them a couple of moments to use their imaginations. Direct them back through the same steps. Once they \"land,\" have them take a moment to focus on the sensations of their breath. Then ask them to open their eyes and share their experiences. \nBeyond 'Namaste'\nAlthough I've never personally experienced controversy teaching yoga to children, as a yoga trainer in professional sports, I have encountered pushback due to religious implications and other misconceptions. Consequently, some teams prefer to call my sessions \"breathing, mobility and meditation\" rather than yoga. \nAs such, I have adapted my teaching in sports to almost entirely avoid hands in prayer position and Sanskrit pose names or Hindu terms, like \"Namaste.\" Instead of symbolic interpretations and semantics, let's focus on what we can all achieve -- regardless of faith or age -- when we practice yoga-based techniques that empower us to live healthier and happier in our minds and bodies.", "Drunk off kombucha tea?": "\"I started doing it at home. And I think it was about 30 days to about two months I started getting movement in my legs,\" Rothbauer said. \nRothbauer said he can't credit kombucha alone for his healing but said it marked a turning point in his recovery. \n\"It did make me feel really good, and I think the probiotics helped me assimilate nutrients and helped me heal,\" he said. \nYet federal regulators now warn the fermented concoction may not be all good, and say the drink, that's currently sold on grocery store shelves, available to anyone, might need to be moved to a liquor store.\nSome warn that even with low levels of alcohol there are risks to pregnant women and children, or those who are allergic. \nWhat is kombucha?\nKombucha isn't sold as an alcoholic beverage. It's marketed as a health drink, a fermented tea with a signature vinegary flavor and a key ingredient in the production that looks like a mysterious giant mushroom. \n\"That's why they call it the Manchurian mushroom, but there is no fungal property to it at all,\" said Rothbauer, who now owns High Country Kombucha, which is nestled in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. \nRothbauer said the so-called mushroom is actually a combination of yeast and bacteria that creates a powerful probiotic meant to boost immunity and offer other medicinal healing benefits. \nThe drink has been around for thousands of years and is believed to have originated in Asia. It's been popular with health food enthusiasts for years. But it's recently become mainstream,\n \nwith an estimated $600 million in sales this past year, according to an industry advocacy group.\n \nYou can find it in grocery store chains such as Safeway and Kroger. \nRothbauer's High Country Kombucha factory produces 10,000 cases of kombucha a month, 8,000 bottles per day, in 13 flavors. It ship the bottles to stores all over the United States. Rothbauer said he hopes to quadruple his business in four years if the feds don't stop its growth.\nQuandary over alcohol content \nThe Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau\n recently sent letters to kombucha producers, including Rothbauer, saying some samples tested above the .5% alcohol-by-volume threshold for nonalcoholic beverages. That's about one-eighth the alcohol content of a light beer. \nRothbauer admits alcohol can be a result of the fermentation process when the tea, sugar, bacteria and yeast combine. While they test every batch of kombucha that's bottled and boxed at High Country Kombucha before shipping, he said the alcohol content can increase if the beverage isn't refrigerated. \nBut could someone get drunk off kombucha? \n\"No, no,\" Rothbauer said, laughing. \"I don't know if you've tasted kombucha, but it's not something that you drink bottle after bottle. You know, this is something that's fermented. It would be like trying to drink vinegar bottle after bottle. And you would have to drink eight bottles (of kombucha) just to get the buzz of one beer.\" \nBut the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau\n \nhas threatened businesses found in violation with a fine of up to $11,000. Its letter tells producers they must figure out a way to keep the alcohol level under 0.5% consistently or change the labeling to mark it as an alcoholic beverage. In many states, doing so would mean paying more taxes and ending sales in grocery stores.  \n\"It kills the industry. People that are looking for healthy alternatives don't go to liquor stores to look for it,\" Rothbauer said. \nCongressman takes up cause\nU.S. Rep. Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, called it a \"complete misclassification\" to label kombucha as alcohol. Polis, a kombucha drinker himself, is now going to bat for kombucha producers in his home state. \n\"I've enjoyed it, many enjoy it, and it has nothing to do with an alcoholic beverage.\" Polis said. \nHe has asked federal regulators for leniency. Polis said he believes reliable testing is the real issue. He's working with kombucha brewers to advocate for updated testing methods. \nWhen contacted by CNN, Thomas Hogue, a spokesman at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, said the agency has agreed to look into alternative testing.\nWhat about the health claims?\nWhile the future of kombucha hangs in the balance, health experts said scrutiny is warranted and consumers should be cautious. \n\"I think that some of the risks (around the alcohol content) outweigh some of the benefits around kombucha -- at least some of the potential benefits, nutrient benefits,\" warned Bonnie Jortberg, a nutritionist with the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\nTo play it safe, Jortberg said some of the potential health benefits of kombucha, such as probiotics and antioxidants, can be found in other products -- yogurt, fruits, vegetables and even simple green tea -- but without the risk of unpredictable alcohol content. \nShe said she pushes for as much transparency in labeling as possible, because \"as a consumer, that's how we can make an educated decision about the kinds of foods and beverages we are consuming.\"", "Husband and wife never expected their Fitbit would tell them this ...": "David Trinidad noticed that the month old fitness tracker his wife, Ivonne Trinidad, was wearing was registering an elevated heart rate. After seeing high rate readings, David, 34-year-old sales manager at a staffing agency, turned to the social aggregating site Reddit for answers on Friday.\n\"My wife's Fitbit is showing her heartbeat being consistently high over the last few days... I'm not sure if something is wrong with the sensor,\" \nhe posted.\nFor 32-year-old\n \nIvonne, her average heart rate measured in the mid 70s, but for several days that number began rising.\nThe \nfitness tracker\n has a sensor on the back of the wristband that continuously monitors the user's heart rate. The product also monitors steps taken, calories burns and other health-related data. The data is transferred to a smartphone or website where the user can keep an eye on any changes or progress.\n\"Honestly, I was hoping for a solution so I wouldn't have to go through the hassle of replacing the defective device,\" David told CNN. \"A part of me also wanted to save the day, as husbands love to do.\"\n \nThere were dozens of people who provided great advice, but one took them by surprise. One user posted in the comments: \"Has she experienced anything really stressful in the last few days or is it a possibility she is pregnant?\"\nThe Trinidads had recently started trying to have a baby, so this suggestion was a possibility.\n\"I was definitely very scared and very excited and felt a rush of all those emotions at once,\" David said when he realized he could soon be a father. \nThe couple picked up 10 pregnancy tests that night. They all came back positive. With this being their first time expecting, David Trinidad said that there are a few symptoms of pregnancy he and his wife hadn't learned about. Heart rate is one of several indicators that can give doctors a clue if they think their patient is expecting a child.\n \n\"The woman's heart has to work harder to supply blood to the uterus, so the heart rate can go up,\" said \nJennifer Shu,\n pediatrician and co-author of \"Heading Home with your Newborn.\"\nYour \nresting heart rate\n is the heart pumping the lowest amount of blood you need when you are not exercising. This can range between 60-100 beats a minute, according to the \nAmerican Heart Association\n. \nAfter visiting their doctor on Tuesday, the couple found out they are about five weeks along and also got a peek of their baby through a preliminary sonogram. \nBoth baby and mom received a clean bill of health.\nThe soon-to-be dad let the Reddit community know they are expecting a baby and joked he will have to start watching his own heart rate.\nCNN reached out to \nFitbit\n, and company representatives were happy to hear about this story. The company did not provide a statement in regards to this specific incident. Fitbit is aware of several customer stories about how the fitness tracker has detected other issues, but those claims have not been independently verified by Fitbit, according to a representative.", "What does it mean to die of 'natural causes?'": "The answers are more complicated than the simple, common phrase would lead many to believe, and they even have legal ramifications. \nHere is a look inside the process doctors go through to determine whether a death was \"natural,\" and what exactly that means (or doesn't).\nWhat are 'natural causes'?\nIt might not seem to mean much at all. But when a death certificate says a person's death was \"natural,\" it is really ruling out the involvement of external causes. The person did not take their own life and they were not killed by somebody else or in an accident such as a car crash or drug overdose.\n\"It's solely and exclusively due to natural causes, a natural disease process \u2014infection, cancer, heart disease, all of those things that are going to carry us off at some point along the way,\" Fowler said.\nDeath certificates almost always include more details about specifically how the body failed, such as heart disease or kidney failure, even if it is only the best guess of the coroner (a trained official) or medical examiner (a doctor) charged with investigating the death. \n\"When a medical examiner fills out a death certificate, it's their medical opinion based on all their experience and training that this is what happening,\" said Dr. David R. Fowler, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. \n\"You're rather like a judge. You weigh the evidence, and based on the predominance of evidence you come to a decision that I think this is what caused the problem, but I'm going to be an honest person and list all these other causes,\" Fowler said. These other causes appear in a second section of the death certificate for potential contributing causes.\nBut that's not to say that something in the environment can't trigger a natural death. \"If I'm playing a sport and have heart attack ... or shovel snow and have a heart attack because I stressed myself, that's natural,\" Fowler said. Yet if those activities precipitate a death that might not have otherwise happened, for example if shoveling snow caused hypothermia, that could be considered an accident, he added.\nNot a cause but a manner of death\nTo capture all these nuances, death certificates go beyond just stating whether the death was natural or not.\nThere is only a small section on most death certificates where doctors check a box to indicate the \"manner of death\" as natural, accident, suicide, homicide or \"undetermined.\" There is a more involved section for \"cause of death.\" Here doctors are \nrequired\n to try to specify the immediate cause of death, along with the underlying condition that led up to it, and how long before death they occurred. \nFor example, on a death certificate where the manner of death is listed as natural, the immediate cause of death could be a tear in the heart wall that happened minutes before death, and the underlying causes could be a heart attack or heart disease that took place in the days, months and years before death.\nHow common is 'natural' death?\nGlobally, most deaths are considered natural. It was true a century ago and it is true today. The most common specific causes of natural deaths in the United States have shifted from the scourges of the early 1900s -- tuberculosis, influenza, diarrhea -- to \nmodern killers\n such as heart disease and cancer. But \nthrough it all\n, accidents, suicides and \nhomicides\n have made up less than 10% of total deaths.  \nWhen a medical examiner determines a death to be natural, Fowler explained, they are usually able to list with a \"reasonable degree of medical certainty\" the threshold that states generally ask for: what the likely causes were. \"It's unusual to have a natural manner of death and unknown causes.\"\nDo you need an autopsy?\nThe decision not to perform an autopsy on Antonin Scalia drew \ncriticism\n because of the many questions surrounding his sudden death -- which a county judge determined to be natural, despite not having seen the body -- and because he was an important public figure. \n\"It's entirely possible and acceptable practice to not do an autopsy and call (the death) natural, as long as by external examination there are no lumps, bumps, bruises,\" Fowler said. \"In many cases, based on past medical history and an inspection of the (death) scene, and if the person is of the right age, it's not unacceptable,\" he added.\nScalia, for example, had been reported to have \nheart problems\n. \nHowever, in the case of a younger person with no history of a medical condition, \"an autopsy becomes a much more critical part of the process. Young people don't just die suddenly,\" Fowler said.\nIs a death ruling final?\nAlthough death certificates are meant to give closure and peace of mind to family members of the deceased, they are not necessarily final. States generally require death certificates be completed within \nseveral days of death\n, unless an extension has been granted. But if new information about the death, such as the results of an autopsy, becomes available, the physician handling the certificate can \namend\n it. \nDeath certificates have myriad uses beyond giving families closure or peace of mind. Researchers use the information to measure the health status of an area, track medical conditions and set research and policy goals. Family members of the deceased may be required to submit a certificate to receive payment from life insurance programs, settle their loved one's estate or to get a burial permit.\nCertificates are also key in wrongful death lawsuits brought against, for example, a physician for alleged medical malpractice or a driver for alleged negligence that caused a fatal car crash.\n'Natural death' can still be preventable \nAlthough it may seem like a natural death would be the most straightforward conclusion to life, it is not always the case.\n\"There are more potential legal outcomes when the manner of death is not natural, but there is still significant potential for legal outcomes when a person died of a natural manner of death,\" Fowler said. \"If you put a natural cause of death on a death certificate, there's still a chance that the treating physician could be sued by the family. (They) might want more information to know if this is something that could have been prevented.\"", "A glove to block Parkinson's tremors?": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological condition that is estimated to affect between 7 and ten million people worldwide, according to the \nParkinson's Disease Foundation\n. \nThe condition manifests itself mostly through tremors that often make hands shake uncontrollably, impacting the daily lives of sufferers.\nWhile medications are a valid early treatment, they progressively become\n less effective\n and come with several side effects.\nThe proposed \nGyroGlove\n uses the laws of physics -- rather than chemistry -- to stabilize a patient's hand and control tremors mechanically.\nIt's hoped to be effective not just against Parkinson's disease, but also \nEssential Tremor\n, a condition eight times more common than Parkinson's Disease, according to the \nInternational Essential Tremor Foundation\n.\n\"It feels as if your hand is moving in thick treacle,\" explains Faii Ong, the 26 year old founder of \nGyroGear\n, \"It means you are able to make smooth, slow movements, and any fine shakes are automatically and instantaneously counteracted. You're able to do whatever you need to do -- make your coffee, cook, that sort of thing.\"\nThe science of spinning tops\nThe glove uses a surprisingly simple concept -- a spinning top -- to help steady the wearer's hand. \nSpinning tops stay upright when they spin by converting angular momentum. This means they resist any input of force, such as tremors, immediately and proportionally. \n\"That's exactly what we're doing with the glove, except that we are hiking it up. We're spinning the disk faster than a jet turbine, at about 20,000 rpm and we are coupling that directly to the hand,\" says Ong.\nInspired by an elderly patient\nAs a medical student, Ong witnessed first hand the debilitating effects of tremors, and was inspired to find a solution after seeing an old woman struggling to eat.\n\"She was trying to drink soup and then everything went down her front. So I spent the next half an hour cleaning her up, and I asked the nurses why they didn't do anything. And they said she's 103 ... there's really nothing we can do.\"\nNot to be deterred, Ong founded GyroGear in early 2015. The team is made up of volunteer students and graduates specializing in electrical, mechanical and biological engineering.\n\"The entire thing has only been possible because of the team ... It's a good mixture,\" says Ong who, himself, is just finishing medical school.\"\nIt's got the 'F' Factor\nTo date, the device has mainly been funded personally, but has received support from \nImperial College London \nand the National Clinical Director of the UK's National Health Service, Tony Young. The team also won \u00a310,000 funding from the \nF Factor, \nan EU tech start-up competition launched by Simon Cowell.\nWhilst there are already a few products on the market catering for people with tremors -- like specially made \nspoons\n, \npens\n or \nmugs\n -- there is little available in the form of a universal solution.\n\"We actually built a rig that simulated really bad hand tremors. We achieved a 90% decrease in shakes. That's just the bench top test,\" says Ong.\nThe need for further testing\nThe technology is admirable, but a long road lies ahead for the glove to become an everyday reality. \n\"In theory, this could be incredibly beneficial for people with Parkinson's, but as with all new technologies, further research will be necessary to determine its short and long term effectiveness,\" cautions Stuart Palma, a professional adviser from the \nChartered Society of Physiotherapy\n (CSP). \nFor now, GyroGlove is a bulky prototype, but Ong is confident they will be ready to launch the product in the U.K. by September 2016. The glove will have a sales price ranging from \u00a3400-\u00a3600 (around $600-900).\n\"We have the mechanics, the electronics, and we have the harness...all the different components work, we're just trying to integrate it together,\" says Ong.\nA large component of treatment for Parkinson's disease today comes from physiotherapy, which has had mixed success. A \nrecent study\n suggested it may be ineffective, but the Clinical Director of Parkinson's U.K., David Burns, believes there's still considerable evidence physiotherapy improves the lives of people with the disease.\nParkinson's and beyond\nWhile primarily targeting patients with tremors, Ong also envisions the glove being used for archery, photography, and in medical practice, through its ability to stabilize hands.\n\"A lot of surgeons have expressed their interest,\" he adds. For now, the aim remains to wave goodbye to tremors.\nOng described the moment a 71-year-old woman tried the device for the first time who had suffered from Essential Tremor for about 40 years.\nRead: 'Instagram for doctors' lets medics share photos to solve mystery cases\n\"Even with our weakest prototype, which is currently about four to five months old, she was able to pick up a bottle of water ... that on its own is usually a two handed affair on a good day for her. It was a beautiful moment because it represented a point where we could say, yes, all that effort has been worth it.\"", "Air rage triggered by walking past first-class seating, study says": "A new study suggests an unexpected trigger for these rare cases of air rage. It found that passengers in economy seating were 3.84 times more likely to have an incident of air rage if they were on a plane that had a first-class section. They were 2.18 times more likely to have an outburst if they had to walk through first class to board the plane, as opposed to boarding in the middle of the plane, directly into the economy section.\n\"Psychology (research) tells us that when people feel a sense of deprivation and inequality, they are more likely to act out,\" said Katherine A. DeCelles, associate professor of organizational behavior at the University of Toronto. DeCelles is the lead author of the study, which was \npublished on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n.\nPassengers are probably not even consciously aware of the deprivation and inequality, and how much it is stressing them out, DeCelles said. However, she and her colleague were not able to talk with the enraged passengers to get a better idea what set them off.\nThere was also a nearly 12-fold increase in the rate of air rage among first-class passengers on flights where all passengers boarded through the first-class section, compared with flights that had separate entrances for first class and economy.\n\"When people from higher social class backgrounds are more aware of their higher status, they are more likely to be antisocial, to have entitled attitudes and to be less compassionate,\" DeCelles said.\nThe researchers looked at a database from a large international airline that collected information on air rage during several recent years. DeCelles and her colleague could not reveal the identity of the airline or specify the years or exact number of air rage cases because it could be used to identify the airline.  \nOverall, cases of air rage were rare. For every 1,000 flights on planes with a first-class section, there were 1.58 incidents of air rage in economy and 0.31 in first class, adding up to a total of a few thousand cases of air rage during the several-year period. However, flight crews might not have reported every case of air rage, so the real number could be higher, DeCelles said.\nFlight crews categorize air rage in one of several types: belligerent behavior, emotional outburst, noncompliant behavior, and incidents involving drugs, alcohol, smoking or sex. The researchers found that belligerent behavior, such as an expression of anger, and intoxication were more common in first class, whereas emotional outbursts, such as a panic attack, were more common among economy passengers. \nIs air rage on the rise?\nAccording to news reports, \nthe rate of air rage has been on the rise\n in recent years. But confirming the rise, and putting numbers on it, is tricky because the Federal Aviation Administration, which tracks this information, \ndoes not require\n flight crew to report air rage. The airline DeCelles studied did show a significant increase in reports of air rage over the years they investigated.\nOf all the indignities of air travel, the crowds and tiny seats in coach take \nmost of the blame\n for inciting air rage among travelers. Yet in the current study, DeCelles said, the presence of first-class seating was a better predictor of air rage than the more notorious hassles of flight delays or having scant room between you and the seat in front of you. And the researchers found the nearly fourfold increase in air rage cases after controlling for other factors such as small seats, flight delays and longer flights.\n\"It could be a ceiling effect (with the small seats),\" DeCelles said. \"You are already feeling super cramped and that extra half-inch is not going to make that much of a difference.\"\nIs first class really to blame?\nAlthough the presence of first-class seating could predict air rage, it is not clear from this study if it is actually contributing to this behavior, said Michael McCullough, professor of psychology at University of Miami. \n\"There could be another thousand things associated with the presence of first-class seating\" that are piquing air rage, said McCullough, who was not involved in the study. For example, even though the researchers took into account the size of the economy cabin, there could be features of planes that do not have a first-class section that make people feel less pressure and less like they are being treated like cattle, he added.\n\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. (This study) is provocative, but it does not strike me as an open and shut case,\" McCullough said. If the researchers are actually right that the presence of first class, or having passengers walk through first class, contributes to the risk of air rage, \"someone ought to insist we change the way we structure planes ... some of these incidents really are public hazards,\" he said. \nIn extreme cases, flights have to be diverted or law enforcement has to be called onto the aircraft to handle an unruly passenger.\nIt could be possible to have more planes load passengers in both the middle and front of the aircraft so travelers do not see passengers in the other section, DeCelles said. \"Most aircraft do have doors in the middle, from what I am told from airline executives,\" she said. The bigger issue is whether the airport has the capability of attaching two jetways to the plane.\nIn addition to reducing the incidence of air rage, boarding at the front and middle of the plane could probably also make the entire process of boarding go faster, DeCelles said.", "She lost 185 pounds to pursue the 'heart of a warrior'": "\"I had to ask the stewardess for an extender in front of everyone on the plane, I was horribly embarrassed and didn't want to put myself through that again,\" said Pearson, 32, who lives in Tempe, Arizona, and works as a public defender. \nAt her heaviest, Pearson was 410 pounds. But in January 2008, a couple of years after that moment on the airplane, she was determined to turn things. Pearson began taking walks, cutting out sodas and fast food and trying at-home workout programs. After losing 100 pounds that year, her confidence took off.  \nPearson said she wanted to \"ramp things up even more,\" so she found a personal trainer in 2009 and lost 75 more pounds in eight months. Within 2\u00bd years, she lost a total of 200 pounds. \nHow she lost the weight\nPearson's personal training consisted of strength training, muscle confusion, cardio, boxing and outdoor exercises. \"I maintained a healthy diet, limiting my carbs and increasing my protein and kept a strict exercise regimen,\" she said.\nOne of Pearson's biggest cheerleaders is her mother, Jane Pearson. She provided words of encouragement, prayer and athletic shoes in \"every wild color\" they could find. She gives her daughter one pair of athletic shoes for every weight loss milestone. Pearson has received 12 pairs so far. \nPearson's mom recalls the excitement they felt as they watched Pearson's jeans' size go down. \"How wonderful that she didn't have to worry anymore about not being able to fit into an airplane seat, or having to use a seat belt extender, or be too heavy to ride on a roller coaster,\" Jane Pearson said. \nCollege is where Pearson said she gained the most weight and felt like she didn't fit in. \n\"I was sad and depressed, issues with food were tied to my emotions,\" she said. \"I didn't feel I was pretty enough to join a sorority, no other freshman girls looked like I did.\"\nPearson has deleted a lot of pictures from that time in her life because she does not identify with who she was then and feels like a different person now. \n\"I don't really remember who that 'Joanna' was. I changed so much since my weight loss, my personality is different. Now I'm more outgoing,\" she said. \nBut when Pearson does look at her \"before\" pictures, she is reminded of her progress.\n\"I feel proud because I know I've come so far and I've worked really hard,\" she said.\nHer next goals\nAfter reaching her weight loss goal, Pearson moved on to other physical and personal goals.  As a law school graduation gift to herself and to celebrate passing the bar exam, she signed up for the 2014 Reebok Spartan Race in Phoenix. The day of the race, Pearson ran 4.5 miles. \nHer sister, Jennie Blair, who Pearson describes as her rock, ran the race with her and encouraged her along the way. \n\"I remember holding hands as we leaped over the fire pit at the finish line and then collapsing -- exhausted from joy, running, heat, loss, life and pride,\" said Blair. \nAlthough the Spartan Race was a milestone in her journey, she is not quite finished yet. Valuing herself and healthy living are lifelong goals for Pearson. \nAs a result of her weight loss, Pearson has been dealing with the physical and emotional effects of excess skin. \"I don't have to battle a 400-pound person in the mirror. If the battle wound is the excess skin and I'm gonna live a lot longer and if I can help someone else lose weight, then it's worth it,\" Pearson said. \nKeeping off the weight has had its challenges. Stress from her job and home life led Pearson to gain 35 pounds within the last year, but she was able to lose 20 of those pounds and 20 inches when she hired a nutritionist. \n\"I am back to wearing my smallest size, 8/10, (I) was a 26/28 at my heaviest, and I am taking control of my life once again,\" Pearson said. \nAs a public defender, Pearson sees tragedy and despair daily. Although life is tough, she said, Pearson is thankful for the people who have been with her through it all. \n\"My parents, sister, and best friends have been unfailing in their efforts to support me in all my trials and tribulations and joys and successes.\"\nAs Pearson remains focused on her long-term goals, she continues to pursue what she calls the \"heart of a warrior.\"\n\"I have worked hard and will continue to do so because I am a fighter, I don't give up, and I always keep the faith.\" ", "Health effects of red wine: Where do we stand?": "But through it all -- with the exception of Prohibition and other dark spots in history -- wine has been medicine.\nA lot of the excitement over red wine in recent years has been around resveratrol and whether it can extend life, prevent cancer, cure Alzheimer's -- you name it. But that has obscured some of the more tried-and-true health benefits of wine. Since nearly the dawn of mankind, wine has been added to drinking water to kill bacteria, or consumed as a more hygienic alternative. More recently, the antimicrobial properties of wine, especially red wine, are being studied for cavity prevention.\nIn the 1980s, the heart health benefits of red wine began to emerge. Numerous studies have by now found a connection between imbibing vino and lower rates of heart attack, stroke and death caused by heart disease.\n\"The evidence is more firmly in place for red wine preventing heart disease, diabetes and a few other vascular (conditions) compared to cancer and dementia,\" said Dr. Howard Sesso, associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Massachusetts.\nBut subsequent research revealed a twist to the happy story of red wine and healthy hearts. Other alcoholic drinks, beer and hard liquor, also seemed to provide heart benefits. \n\"That's not to say that there might not be some special quality of red wine like resveratrol that could confer additional benefits,\" Sesso said. At least for now, though, attribute it to the alcohol. \nThe story of red wine's effect on cancer and dementia is cloudier -- some studies found it increased the risks, other studies suggested a decrease. The \nmost recent addition\n to the research found that people who drink red wine had a higher risk of cancers that are related to alcohol consumption, such as breast and liver. But the rub with all these studies is that people who drink red wine, or any kind of alcohol, might be different from non drinkers in other ways, such as diet, exercise level and smoking status.\nBased on the research so far, it seems safe to have a glass of red wine or alcoholic beverage a day, unless you have a medical condition or a history of alcoholism, and it may even provide some heart health benefit, Sesso said. However the risks of drinking too much, such as liver disease, drunken driving and domestic violence, are all very clear, making it difficult for doctors to prescribe drinking even a small amount of red wine in the age of modern medicine.\nHere's a look at how our views on wine have changed over the years.\n3000 B.C.: Wine is the best medicine\nMillennia before Jesus turned water into wine, the ancient Egyptians turned wine into medicine. Researchers found \na jar in the tomb of King Scorpion I\n dating back to 3150 B.C. that contained traces of wine along with residue from balm, coriander, sage and mint. The finding suggests that ancient Egyptians dissolved herbs in wine, and then drank the cocktail to treat stomach problems, herpes and other ailments.\n750 B.C.: Wine does not pair well with womanhood\nAny wife found drinking wine could be put to death, according to the laws of Romulus, King of Rome. Concerns about the \"weaker sex\" imbibing wine continued for centuries. By 14 A.D., a Roman writer described how vino could cause women to \"slip into some disgrace\" and spiral downward \"usually towards illicit sex.\"\n400 B.C.: Hippocrates prescribes red wine for digestion\nThe father of medicine agreed with the ancient Egyptians that wine could soothe stomach ills. He specifically prescribed red wine for digestion and white wine for bladder problems. Wine in general could also serve as a disinfectant for wounds, according to Hippocrates, but the beverage was not appropriate for those with nervous system diseases because it could cause headaches.\n1250: Sip some grog to clear your mental fog\nHundreds of years before \nstudies suggesting that red wine may help protect against the common cold\n, Arnaldus de Villa Nova, a physician in southern France, detailed how wine can help sinus problems. De Villa Nova was also ahead of his time in writing about the benefit of wine for dementia. Current research supports the possibility that \nred wine in moderation could reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease\n.\n1850: Don't drink the water, drink the wine instead\nWater is now considered the healthiest beverage choice, but it was often contaminated with cholera and typhus in the 1800s. A glass of milk, another healthy favorite, might also serve a helping of tuberculosis. As a result, Louis Pasteur, the father of microbiology himself, said that wine was \"the most healthful and hygienic of all beverages.\"  \nWine can also make other beverages healthier. As far back as ancient Greece, it was used to sanitize water for drinking. Then in the late 1800s a Viennese professor demonstrated scientifically that wine can actually kill cholera and typhoid bacteria -- possibly explaining why Hippocrates concluded that wine could help indigestion! Experts began to recommend mixing red or white wine with water six to 12 hours before drinking, a practice that continued through parts of Europe until at least World War II.\n1920: Beware the evils of vino\nHard alcohol started to get a bad rap with the temperance movement of the 1820s as religious groups in the United States and Europe spoke out about the threat of drunkenness and alcoholism. Red wine got a pass at least through the 1800s because it was viewed as hygienic, and less toxic than white wine. But then evidence started to pile up that red wine might also cause health problems, such as high blood pressure and organ damage. \nOver the next few decades, it became clear that red wine, just like white wine, beer and liquor, should be consumed in moderation -- which was the original position of the temperance movement. However, these nuances were lost on the prohibition movements that started cropping up across the United States in the late 1800s.\n1988: Migraine sufferers, put down your glass\nAll of you who complain that red wine gives you migraines got some vindication from science. \nA small 1988 study in London\n found that nine out of 11 people with this complaint did indeed develop a migraine within a few hours of sipping a Spanish red, whereas another eight people served vodka with lemonade remained migraine free. Both beverages were served chilled and in a dark bottle to disguise their identity. The authors of the study concluded that alcohol on its own is not to blame, and that ingredients in red wine such as flavonoids could precipitate the debilitating headaches.\n1992: The French secret to heart health? Red wine, bien s\u00fbr!\nIn the early 1990s, the French paradox made headlines, and forever more (at least, so far) put red wine in a healthy light.\n Doctors described the paradox\n that the French had lower death rates from heart disease in the 1980s than countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, even though they had similar rates of smoking, blood pressure and other risk factors. The doctors suggested the reason could be that the copious amounts of wine -- in particular, red wine -- protects from heart disease.\nMany have questioned\n whether red wine deserved credit back then for lowering heart disease deaths. For one thing, the French actually had less fatty diets in the decades before the 1980s than the UK, which could have been what brought down death rates. But even if the role of red wine in the French paradox was overhyped, other studies in the 1980s and 1990s backed up the link between red wine and increased levels of good cholesterol and antioxidants.  \n1995: Drink to your longevity\nDanish researchers found that, among 6,000 men and 7,000 women,\n those who drank three to five glasses of wine a day\n had a 49% lower rate of death over a 10-year period. Drinking the same amount of beer was not associated with lower death rate, and three to five glasses of hard alcohol increased the death rate by 34%. The researchers did not look at lifestyle factors, though, so it is possible that wine drinkers live longer because they \neat healthier\n or exercise more, for example\nFast forward another few years to 2003 and scientists started getting excited about the possibility that resveratrol, that magic ingredient in red wine and foods such as berries and chocolate, could extend the human life span by 30%. We are still waiting, science.\n2005: Can red wine put a cork in prostate cancer?\nAround the turn of the century, reports started to pour in of links between red wine and cancer risk. A 2005 study is one of the first to find a possible benefit, albeit small, for prostate cancer. It found that each additional glass of red wine that men consumed per week was associated with a 6% decrease in prostate cancer risk. However a larger study of moderate drinkers several years later failed to find a link between red wine and prostate cancer risk, so the jury is still out. \n2007: Smile: Red wine fights cavities\nAlthough it's been known since the late 1800s that red wine can kill bacteria in contaminated water, it took scientists until 2007 to show that it has a similar effect on the bugs that colonize our mouth. The study found that both red and white wine could block the growth of Streptococcus, a common culprit in cavity formation. Red wine had a stronger effect than white, possibly because of the acids it contains. Researchers used wine in which the alcohol had been removed, but it's possible that the alcohol in the real stuff may make it an even more potent bacteria buster. \n2013: Men, liquoring up may help your libido but hurt your fertility\nIt may seem unlikely, but a 2013 study suggests that a component in red wine that acts like estrogen could give sperm a fertility boost. After taking a short bath in this compound, sperm excelled in categories such as moving toward an egg compared with the non-exposed little swimmers. The catch is that higher levels of the compound impaired sperm, and these levels might be closer to the actual dose that the sperm of moderate drinkers are exposed to. \nA point against alcohol consumption in general comes from a 2014 study that found that men who consumed at least five drinks a week had fewer sperm and lower testosterone levels. On the other hand, a study presented at a scientific conference in 2014 found that men who are moderate drinkers had better erections than teetotalers.\n2015: Does the next Alzheimer's treatment hang on a vine?\nResveratrol was shown a decade ago to break up amyloid-beta protein, whose buildup has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, at least in cells growing in a Petri dish. In the newest chapter of this research, a 2015 study provided indirect evidence that a resveratrol pill may be able to prevent amyloid-beta accumulation in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. But many questions remain, most importantly, perhaps, whether resveratrol can reverse symptoms of the disease. And there's some bad news for oenophiles: you would have to drink 1,000 bottles of red wine to get the amount of resveratrol used in this study.\n2015: A closer look at cancer risk\nThe story of red wine and cancer has been a complicated one, but it took a turn for the worse this year. In the past, studies have suggested that red wine may be able to reduce the risk of prostate, as well as lung and colon cancer, but probably only for light to moderate drinkers. A preponderance of research suggest that heavy drinking, on the other hand, increases the risk of lung, colon, liver, stomach and breast cancers, among others.\nThis year, a large study by Harvard researchers shook the notion that moderate alcohol consumption is probably harmless. Healthy middle-aged women who had about a half a glass to a glass of wine a day, or the equivalent amount of beer or liquor, had a 13% higher risk of certain types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. For men, drinking a couple glasses of alcohol a day was associated with 26% increased risk of cancers such as liver, colon and esophagus. For both men and women, heavier drinking carried higher risk. Experts reacted to the findings by urging the importance of keeping alcohol consumption in close check.\n ", "Safety by design: How zoo enclosures are evolving": "It is a mantra that is fundamental to designing exhibits at zoos the world over, where enclosures must be safe environments for both animals and visitors. \nBut how this translates into real-world designs is not always clear cut, as \nthe recent breach at the Cincinnati Zoo attests\n. Zoo officials there shot dead a western lowland gorilla to save a 3-year-old boy who managed to slip into the animal's enclosure Saturday.     \nRob Vernon, spokesman for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which accredits facilities, said the Cincinnati Zoo was \"absolutely\" a respected facility that had produced few issues in its history. \nThe zoo has been accredited without interruption since 1978, most recently in 2014, and earlier this year received an award for maintaining its accreditation for a quarter century, he said. \nDesign evolution\nStandards and zoo design have evolved together, says George Houthoff, CEO and co-owner of Houthoff Zoo Design. \nHe saw his company rebuild the gorilla exhibit at Rotterdam Zoo in the Netherlands after the escape of Bokito, a silverback who wounded four people in 2007. \nHe says that the industry has evolved in leaps and bounds in recent years, but, especially in some countries, there is still a long way to go to ensure complete safety.\n\"Zoos have developed from concrete boxes with steel bars to natural looking habitat immersion environments... (but) worldwide there are still a lot of exhibits in zoos that are potentially dangerous for children.\"\nFormer zookeeper Amanda O'Donoughue, a self-described gorilla lover, \nnoted on Facebook\n that the gravitation to more natural enclosures with seamless views \"is great until little children begin falling into exhibits, which of course can happen to anyone, especially in a crowded zoo-like setting.\" \nZookeepers always kept a welded mesh barrier between themselves and the \"gentle giants\" because the incredibly strong creatures could cause serious harm even when lacking the intent, O'Donoughue said in her post, which has been shared more than 1 million times.\n\"I can't point fingers at anyone in this situation, but we need to really evaluate the safety of the animal enclosures from the visitor side,\" the Tallahassee woman wrote. \"Not impeding that view is a tough one, but there should be no way that someone can find themselves inside of an animal's exhibit.\"\nComplex, stimulating -- and safe\nAnimal welfare needs to go hand in hand with visitor experience and safety, says Patrick Janikowski, principal of PJA Architects. One of the first considerations, he says, is how much space the animals have. \nIf space allows, moats -- like at the gorilla enclosure in Cincinnati -- are used to keep a safe distance between the animals and visitors and give the animals a more \"natural\" environment. If space is more limited, heavy mesh or glass enclosures can give a similar experience. \nThe \ngorilla species survival plan\n, which provides guidelines to 51 zoos, says there is \"no golden rule\" for the size of gorilla enclosures, and as experts learn about optimally housing apes, \"exhibit designs evolve, and hopefully improve over time.\"\n\"Gorillas should be housed in large, complex, environmentally enriched enclosures. Outdoor access should be provided to all gorillas whether on exhibit or off exhibit,\" it says. \"Visual barriers, access to privacy, climbing apparatus, vegetation, nesting material, and manipulable objects are important in reducing stress, social conflict and boredom.\"\nWhat zoo designers, keepers and management are ultimately trying to achieve, Janikowski says, is to give \"optimum space for the animal, optimum viewing for the guest and some type of interaction while keeping everyone safe. \n\"That's really the goal.\"\nChildren: Unpredictable variable\nBut even with complete adherence to standards, accidents happen. \n\"I have four kids. I know what its like to herd cats and try to keep your eye on all of them. It doesn't take long if someone wants to see. That's the thing with little kids... they're down low -- they're always looking around curiously,\" Janikowski says.\n\"That's what (the child who fell into the Cincinnati gorilla enclosure) was doing -- he wanted to see a magnificent animal ... it's hard to blame anyone.\"\nHouthoff agrees that the human factor is an unknown, but the onus still lies with zoos to ensure safety remains paramount.  \nThe basic -- but often ignored -- rules of zoo safety\n\"Kids are kids,\" Houthoff says. \"Of course you have to keep an eye on them (but) I think it's the zoos' responsibility to ensure the safety of their visitors. That means making absolutely sure that exhibits are childproof.\" \n\"What happened in Cincinnati should be a reminder for all zoo staff to keep evaluating the safety of their exhibits, specifically from a small child's perspective.\"\nCincinnati's gorilla enclosure has been inspected in the past, but now it will need to be inspected \"through the lens of a 3-year-old,\" the AZA's Vernon said. While it appears zoo officials handled this incident appropriately, he said, the AZA will likely require modifications to the exhibit. \n\"You don't anticipate something like this happening, or it wouldn't occur,\" Vernon said.", "The top 10 new species of 2016": "Here are 2016's top 10:\nGiant tortoise (\nChelonoidis donfaustoi\n)\nLocation: Galapagos, Ecuador\u202f \nThe giant tortoises of the Galapagos might all look similar, but the ones found in the eastern part of the island are actually a new species. There are only about 250 of them left. So this discovery has immediate conservation implications. The new species is called Chelonoidis donfaustoi in honor of a park ranger, Don Fausto, who worked for four decades to conserve them.\nGiant Sundew (\nDrosera magnifica\n)\nLocation: Brazil\u202f \nHere's to social media. This giant sundew is believed to be the first plant species discovered through photos posted on Facebook. Drosera magnifica, as this plant is called, is massive: at 48 inches, the largest sundew ever seen. So why'd it take so long to find it? It exists only at the summit of a single mountain in Brazil, 5,000 feet above sea level. \nHominin (\nHomo naledi\n)\nLocation: South Africa\u202f \nSay hello to another member of your family tree. Homo naledi, discovered in South Africa, shares some features with modern humans (similar size and weight) and some features with earlier ancestors. For instance, its brain case is similar in size to that of Homo species that lived 2 million to 4 million years ago. This discovery is significant because once scientists are able to pin down the exact age of the remains, it'll give us a clearer picture of our evolutionary timeline.\nIsopod (\nIuiuniscus iuiuensis\n)\nLocation: Brazil\u202f \nIsopods are crustaceans that live in water or on land. And this little guy (a third of an inch long) is blind and unpigmented and has a whole bunch of legs. It does a thing that no one else in the isopod family does: It makes shelters of mud. It needs it too -- because when it's shedding its exoskeleton, it's vulnerable to predators. This species, found in Brazil, has a tongue-twisting name: Iuiuniscus iuiuensis\nAnglerfish (\nLasiognathus dinema\n) \nLocation: Gulf of Mexico\u202f \nThis anglerfish takes the award for the ugliest entry in this year's list. Scientists found the 2-inch-long Lasiognathus dinema in the Gulf of Mexico while assessing damage from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. That fishing pole-like thing you see over its head is called the esca, and it's nifty: Bacteria that emit light hang out in the esca, which is great when you're swimming in the deep, dark ocean. The bioluminescent bacteria also help attract prey. \nSeadragon (\nPhyllopteryx dewysea\n)\u202f \nLocation: Australia\u202f \nThis beauty is ruby red with pink vertical bars. And its discovery off the coast of Western Australia is a big deal because this is now only the third known species of seadragons. As scientists point out, if ruby red dragons that live in shallow waters and are nearly a foot long have only now been discovered, what else don't we know? \nTiny beetle (\nPhytotelmatrichis osopaddington\n)\u202f \nLocation: Peru\u202f \nThis tiny beetle is named Phytotelmatrichis osopaddington, after Paddington Bear. Scientists hope that just like in the kids' books about the lovable bear, people will look after this beetle. It's really small. You'd have to line up 25 of them before you'd reach the one-inch mark on a yardstick. This species was discovered in Peru, making its home in the pools of water that collect in the hollows of plants, such as tree holes.  \nNew primate (\nPliobates cataloniae\n)\u202f \nLocation: Spain\u202f \nThis small ape found in a landfill in Catalonia raises a big, interesting possibility: Could we be more closely related to gibbons than great apes? Her discoverers named her \"Laia\" after \"Eul\u00e0lia,\" original patron saint of Barcelona. She lived about 11.6 million years ago, and she appears to be related to humans, apes and gibbons.  \nFlowering tree (\nSirdavidia solannona\n)\u202f \nLocation: Gabon\u202f \nIf we needed more examples of how species are just waiting to be discovered under our very noses, this is Exhibit A. This new tree species was found just feet from the main road at Monts de Cristal National Park in Gabon. But it probably eluded discovery because scientists focused on larger trees. The Sirdavidia solannona is less 20 feet high, with a diameter of just 4 inches.\nSparklewing (\nUmma gumma\n)\u202f \nLocation: Gabon \n \nSixty new species of dragonflies and damselflies were reported in one single publication; that's the most for any single paper in more than 100 years. We love the name scientists gave this discovery: Umma gumma. (You don't have to be a Pink Floyd fan to get that)."}}
