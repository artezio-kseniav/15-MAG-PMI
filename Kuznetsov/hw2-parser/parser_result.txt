"Bogut's Warriors take NBA playoff into Monday decider"

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
An NBA playoffs record 11 three-pointers from Klay Thompson have helped the Golden State Warriors push the Western Conference Finals series to a game 7 decider. The Warriors' epic 108-101 victory against the Oklahoma Thunder on Saturday night in front of a parochial Thunder crowd squared the series 3-3 with the decider to be held in front of an equally wild Warriors' home crowd in Oakland on Monday. The Warriors trailed for most of the game as they struggled to deal with the Thunder's length, athleticism and tenacity. It was Thompson who kept them within striking distance, throwing up off-balance, quick release bombs with defenders in his face as he scored 41 points, making 11 of 18 shots from three-point range. "Klay's shooting was some of the most incredible shooting you will ever see," said Warriors coach Steve Kerr, whose team has rallied from 3-1 down. Thompson's backcourt partner and NBA MVP Stephen Curry had 29 points, including six of 13 three-pointers, 10 rebounds and nine assists. "We never gave up," Thompson said. "Our resiliency paid off in the end." Curry started cold, going scoreless until midway through the second quarter. But, with four minutes to go and the Warriors trailing 93-97, Curry struck with two straight three-pointers to even the score and bench player Andre Iguodala came up with big offensive and defensive plays to keep the Warriors alive. "I thought Andre Iguodala was the unsung hero for his defence," Kerr said. The Warriors' Australian centre Andrew Bogut had a rocky night as he jousted with the Thunder's Kiwi big man Steven Adams. Bogut had five points, five rebounds and four assists, while Adams got the better of him with nine points, nine rebounds and a monster right handed dunk at the end of the second quarter over Draymond Green. Thunder guard Russell Westbrook was a handful for the Warriors with 28 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds while the team's other All-Star Kevin Durant had 29 points and seven rebounds. The Thunder, however, failed to score in the final two minutes while the Warriors closed out the game with nine points. The winner of game seven will play the Cleveland Cavaliers in the best-of-seven championship series, with game one on Thursday.  ninemsn 2016 Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Melbourne university lecturer Maria Strydom collapsed just 15 minutes' climb from the summit of Mt Everest.She died on the way back down the mountain in her husband's arms on May 20."I asked 'do you mind if I go on', and she said 'yes you go on, I'll wait for you here'," her husband Robert Gropel told the Seven Network on Sunday. "From that position the summit didn't look that far, 15 minutes away."When I made it to the summit of Everest it wasn't special to me because I didn't have her there."I just ran up and down and it didn't mean anything to me."Dr Strydom, 34, was nearing the 8850-metre summit when she fell ill with altitude sickness.On the way back down the mountain she struggled to walk and started speaking gibberish.With the medication and more oxygen brought up by Sherpas, Dr Strydom improved and was making her way down.But she suddenly collapsed and could not be revived."I'm her husband, it's my job to protect my wife and get her home and it's just natural for me to blame myself," Mr Gropel said."I still can't look at any pictures of her because it breaks my heart."Dr Strydom, a finance lecturer at Monash University, and Mr Gropel, a veterinarian, were vegans who were determined to climb the highest mountains on each continent."We want to prove that vegans can do anything and more," Dr Strydom said in March.Sherpa climbers brought Dr Strydom's body down the mountain to Camp 2 on Wednesday, where a rescue helicopter picked her up and took her to Kathmandu on Friday."Her body has now been brought to Kathmandu from the mountain," said Phu Tenzi Sherpa of the Seven Summit Treks that organised her expedition.

"No killer blows in leaders' debate"

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
The dead heat in the leaders' debate does not bode well for the rest of the election campaign - or the next government.Malcolm Turnbull stuck to his stump speech about having an economic plan.Bill Shorten strictly adhered to his lines on protecting Medicare and doing more for schools. The two leaders sparred over climate change and asylum seekers.But even these two debate points fell flat as the pair exchanged cheap shots.Turnbull said Shorten would reignite the people smuggling trade.Shorten shot back on climate policy describing Turnbull as "Tony Abbott lite" and dropping in a fresh zinger which was probably workshopped using focus groups."There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you."Despite Labor narrowly leading in the polls, Shorten needed a big lift from the debate but instead merely reinforced the messages of the past three weeks.Politically, the winners from such moribund campaign events will be independents and minor parties who hold the real key to who governs after July 2.The most recent polls show almost one in three voters could cast a ballot for either the Greens or another non-major party or independent.With Shorten on Sunday night pledging Labor would block the coalition's biggest economic pledge - a 10-year corporate tax cut plan - these parties could play a pivotal role post-election.The debate won't shift votes and it appears, at least at this stage, the campaign won't either.The election result remains headed towards a modest swing against Turnbull, delivering a coalition government facing a horrendously complex Senate.

'Turnbull and Shorten face off in first official debate'
[ URL OF ARTICLE ]
http://www.9news.com.au/national/2016/05/29/16/53/leaders-prepare-for-first-official-debate
[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten have gone head to head in their first official debate at the National Press Club in Canberra, arguing on company tax cuts, climate change, health and asylum seekers.The leaders were grilled by three senior political journalists in the hour-long debate, in contrast to the town hall-style people's forum held in western Sydney earlier this month.Their performances were widely regarded as lacklustre on social media. Mr Turnbull opened the debate pitching his national economic plan. "These are times of enormous opportunity and uncertainty, these are times of great challenge," Mr Turnbull said. "These are times when we need a clear economic plan." Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the election was about the next 10 to 20 years. "This election is about ... Labor's positive plans for a strong economy and a fair society," he said. He said Labor's plans would "ensure jobs, education and Medicare".Both leaders were asked how they could be trusted by voters following the unceremonious dumping of leaders in recent years.Political editor of the Australian Financial Review, Laura Tingle asked Mr Turnbull whether he had abandoned things he believed in and whether the nation would see a different Malcolm Turnbull if he was given his own mandate.Mr Turnbull said he was a "well-known quantity in Australian public life". "I did not come into this role as a political activist," he said. "I did not come in here as a political staffer." "I came into this role as an adult, at 50, after a lifetime of working and building businesses." Mr Shorten said Labor had learned its lesson from the "difficult period" of leadership change. "We have demonstrated more unity of purpose than we have in a very long time," he said.Asked whether they would respect each other's mandates should the other party win, Mr Turnbull said it was impossible to know what a Labor government would deliver because it backflipped on policies such as restoring the Schoolkids Bonus. Mr Shorten said Labor would not support the coalition's $50 billion corporate tax cut plan, meaning the coalition would need crossbench support or a Senate majority to get its key economic policy through parliament.CLIMATE CHANGE Asked about climate change and his former support for emissions trading, Mr Turnbull said Australia was playing its part."I stand where I have always stood, recognising that we must take action as a global community to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to protect our environment for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that come thereafter," Mr Turnbull said.Mr Shorten said the prime minister was "Tony Abbott lite" when it came to tackling climate change."Malcolm, whatever happened to the old Malcolm Turnbull on climate change? You were so impressive when you were leading on climate change. Now you're just implementing Tony Abbott's policies," Mr Shorten said. "There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you." Mr Turnbull said it was "another cheap shot".Environment protesters gave the leaders a noisy welcome as they arrived for their head-to-head campaign debate.About a dozen people holding signs calling for action on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef stood outside as the leaders arrived 30 minutes before the debate.COMPANY TAX CUTSLabor will block the coalition's proposed corporate tax cuts in the Senate if the government is returned to power on July 2."I have to say that when it comes to corporate tax cuts Labor doesn't think they're the right idea for this nation - full stop," Mr Shorten said.He said the government's $50 billion tax cut plan was a "very expensive risk", which mirrored the economic strategies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Mr Turnbull said former Labor treasurer Paul Keating cut company tax to boost the economy."Why did he do that? ... For every dollar cut from company tax you get $3 going to labour - the employees - and $4 additional value in GDP," Mr Turnbull said."We are lowering taxes on investment so we get more investment."HEALTH Mr Shorten promised to boost hospitals funding by a "significant dimension". But the opposition leader declined to say whether a Labor government would restore all of the Commonwealth health funding cut from the states in the controversial 2014 budget. "When it comes to our hospitals policy, we won't announce our whole policy platform tonight ... but what I can promise Australians right here, right now, is we will put more funding into hospitals than Mr Turnbull has promised by some significant dimension."ASYLUM SEEKERS Mr Turnbull said people smugglers were telling their customers if Labor was elected "it'll be all on again", after declaring he could "rule out any of the detainees coming to Australia"."The reality is we have to be very firm about this. We do no favours to anybody by being weak on border protection in the way Labor was."He said Labor was a party divided on asylum seeker policy."He claims to be on a unity ticket with me but his party is not," Mr Turnbull said of the opposition leader.Mr Shorten said Mr Turnbull was "playing with fire" with the remarks as he had conceded people smugglers were "watching every nuance in the debate"."Shame on you for giving the people smugglers any hope that they could be back in business," he said to Mr Turnbull."Labor has the same approach as the government when it comes to deterring and defeating the people smugglers." Mr Turnbull was criticised on social media for referring to his upbringing."I was brought up by a single dad who didn't have much money. And he struggled to send me to school, and I had some really charismatic teachers that transformed my life." Follow Sir Joy Libs Lie @apgf2009 Turnbull brings up his 'single dad' & Lucy when talking about education Wh-a-a-a-t!?! #leadersdebate View on Twitter Follow Graham Perrett @GrahamPerrettMP I love Mr Turnbull's battler millionaire dad's back story. #leadersdebate #auspol2016 View on Twitter Mr Shorten said he was a person who "stood up for the fair go my whole working life.

Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull have fended off questions about their trustworthiness and ability to deliver on their pledges after the election.Entering the fourth week of a gruelling eight-week election campaign, the prime minister and opposition leader gave lacklustre performances at the first formal leaders' debate on Sunday night.Mr Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott in September to become prime minister, while Mr Shorten played a role in dumping Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. The prime minister answered the question on trust saying he was a "well-known quantity in Australian public life"."I did not come into this role as a political activist," he said. "I came into this role as an adult, at 50, after a lifetime of working and building businesses."Mr Shorten took the question head-on, saying Labor had learned its lesson from the "difficult period" of leadership change."We have demonstrated more unity of purpose than we have in a very long time," he said.Asked whether they would respect each other's mandates should the other party win, Mr Turnbull said it was impossible to know what a Labor government would deliver because it backflipped on policies such as restoring the Schoolkids Bonus.Mr Shorten said Labor would not support the coalition's $50 billion corporate tax cut plan, meaning the coalition would need crossbench support or a Senate majority to get its key economic policy through parliament.The debate got heated when the prime minister suggested people smugglers would use a Labor government as a "marketing opportunity" to get back into business."Shame on you," Mr Shorten said.The Labor leader described Mr Turnbull as "Tony Abbott lite" when it came to tackling climate change, given the prime minister had walked away from his previous support for an emissions trading scheme."There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you," Mr Shorten said.Mr Turnbull said it was "another cheap shot".In his opening statement, Mr Turnbull said it was a time of enormous opportunity and uncertainty, which needed a "clear economic plan".Mr Shorten said the election was about the next 10 to 20 years."This election is about ...

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Malcolm Turnbull has opened the first formal leaders' debate pitching his national economic plan.Mr Turnbull says that these are times of enormous opportunity and uncertainty, these are times of great challenge.He says these are times when Australia needs a clear economic plan. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the election was about the next 10 to 20 years."This election is about ... Labor's positive plans for a strong economy and a fair society," he said.Labor's plans would "ensure jobs, education and Medicare".The government's $50 billion tax cut plan was a "very expensive risk", which mirrored the economic strategies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.Mr Turnbull said former Labor treasurer Paul Keating cut company tax to boost the economy."Why did he do that? ... For every dollar cut from company tax you get $3 going to labour - the employees - and $4 additional value in GDP," Mr Turnbull said.Asked about climate change and his former support for emissions trading, Mr Turnbull said Australia was playing its part."I stand where I have always stood, recognising that we must take action as a global community to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to protect our environment for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that come thereafter."Both leaders were asked how they could be trusted by voters given that they had been involved in dumping their own parties' leaders in recent years.Mr Turnbull said he was a "well-known quantity in Australian public life"."I did not come into this role as a political activist," he said."I did not come in here as a political staffer."I came into this role as an adult, at 50, after a lifetime of working and building businesses."Mr Shorten said Labor had learned its lesson from the "difficult period" of leadership change."We have demonstrated more unity of purpose than we have in a very long time," he said.Mr Shorten said the prime minister was "Tony Abbott lite" when it came to tackling climate change."There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you," Mr Shorten said.Mr Turnbull said it was "another cheap shot".

Labor will block the coalition's proposed corporate tax cuts in the Senate if the government is returned to power on July 2.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was asked at the leaders' debate whether Labor would respect a coalition government's mandate on the 10-year tax cut plan outlined in the May budget."I have to say that when it comes to corporate tax cuts Labor doesn't think they're the right idea for this nation - full stop," Mr Shorten said on Sunday.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
More than 700 migrants are feared dead in three Mediterranean Sea shipwrecks south of Italy in the last few days as they tried desperately to reach Europe in unseaworthy smuggling boats, the UN refugee agency says.Carlotta Sami, spokeswoman for UNHCR, told The Associated Press that an estimated 100 people are missing from a smugglers' boat that capsized on Wednesday. The Italian navy took horrific pictures of that capsizing even as it rushed to rescue all those thrown into the sea from the boat.She said about 550 other migrants and refugees are missing from a smuggling boat that capsized on Thursday morning after leaving the western Libyan port of Sabratha a day earlier. She says refugees who saw the boat sink told her agency that that boat, which was carrying about 670 people, didn't have an engine and was being towed by another packed smuggling boat before it capsized.About 25 people from the capsized boat managed to reach the first boat and survive, 79 others were rescued by international patrol boats and 15 bodies were recovered.According to survivors, the second boat was carrying about 500 migrants when it started taking on water after about eight hours of navigation. Efforts to empty the water - with a line of migrants passing a few five-litre bailing cans - were insufficient and the boat was completely under water after an hour and a half, police said.At that point, the commander of the first smuggler's boat ordered the tow rope to be cut to the sinking boat.The migrants on the top deck jumped into the sea, while those below deck, estimated at 300, sank with the ship, police said. Of those who jumped into the sea, just 90 were rescued.Survivors identified the commander of the boat with the working engine as a 28-year-old Sudanese man, who has been arrested, police said.In a third shipwreck on Friday, Sami says 135 people were rescued, 45 bodies were recovered and an unknown number of people - many more, the migrants say - are missing.Survivors are being taken to the Italian ports of Taranto and Pozzallo. Sami says the UN agency is trying to gather information with sensitivity considering that most of the new arrivals are either shipwreck survivors themselves or traumatised by what they saw.Italy's southern islands are the main destinations for countless numbers of smuggling boats launched from the shores of lawless Libya each week packed with people seeking jobs and safety in Europe. Hundreds of migrants drown each year attempting the dangerous Mediterranean Sea crossing.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
France's president and Germany's chancellor want their countries' improbable friendship to be a source of hope for today's fractured Europe as they commemorate the centenary of the longest battle of World War I.In solemn ceremonies on Sunday in the forests of eastern France, Francois Hollande of France and Angela Merkel of Germany are marking 100 years since the 10-month Battle of Verdun, which killed 163,000 French and 143,000 German soldiers and wounded hundreds of thousands of others.Between February and December 1916, an estimated 60 million shells were fired in the battle. One out of four didn't explode, and remain in the soil. The front line villages destroyed in the fighting were never rebuilt. The battlefield zone still holds millions of unexploded shells, making the area so dangerous that housing and farming are still forbidden. With no survivors left to remember, the commemoration now focuses on educating youth about the horrors and consequences of the war. Some 4000 French and German children will take part in Sunday's events, which conclude at a mass grave where French president Francois Mitterrand took German chancellor Helmut Kohl's hand in 1984 in a breakthrough moment of friendship and trust by longtime enemy nations.Merkel said on Saturday the event shows "how good relations between Germany and France are today" and the achievements of European unity."In a world with global challenges, it is important to keep developing this Europe," she said in a weekly address, expressing hope that Britain would not vote to leave the European Union in a June 23 referendum.Amid rising support for far right parties and divisions among European countries over how to handle refugees, Hollande said he wants to work alongside Merkel to "relaunch the European ideal.""We must take action ... at a moment when Europe is affected by the disease of populism," he told France Culture radio this week. He also noted the threat from violent extremism, saying the EU "must protect the people", especially against "terrorism".Hollande and Merkel will spend the entire day together, starting at the cemetery of Consenvoye where 11,148 German soldiers are buried. Then they'll visit Verdun city hall to honour the martyred city, almost entirely in ruins at the end of the war.The main ceremony will take place in the afternoon at the Douaumont Ossuary, memorial to 130,000 unidentified French and German soldiers.Merkel, noting the importance of spreading the message of peace to younger generations, said, "I don't think you can shape the future if you don't also concern yourself with the past."

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Australian and Thai police and investigation authorities are forming a joint task force to combat crime syndicates and drug trafficking in South East Asia.Task force Storm follows a similar agreement between the Australian Federal Police and Chinese drug suppression and trafficking authorities reached last year.AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin on Monday will sign agreements in Bangkok together with the Thai Minister for Justice, General Paiboon Koomchaya, and secretary general of the Narcotics Control Board (NCB), Narong Rattanannugul, an NCB spokesperson said. A joint agency agreement will establish the task force covering narcotics and transnational crime, bringing together the AFP with Thailand's NCB, the Anti-Money Laundering Officer, the Justice Ministry's Department of Special Investigation and the Royal Thai Police.The task force is in line with the China agreement, known as Task Force Blaze, set up in Guangzhou in November last year, where the AFP may conduct several operations across a range of transnational crimes.The agreement in China linked the AFP with the Chinese National Narcotics Control Commission, China's anti-smuggling bureau and the Guangdong Public Security Bureau.Thailand has long been a prime source of opiates into Australia, especially heroin, produced in the Golden Triangle region, largely in Myanmar over several decades.Australia has also had longstanding co-operation agreements with the Thai Narcotics Control Board.But in recent years Australia has faced a growing wave of trafficking of new psychoactive substances, and amphetamine type stimulants especially crystal methamphetamine or "ice".This pattern of smuggling also mirrors the trend in China, with Australia seen by crime syndicates as a "high yield market".Security analysts said the joint task force would enable operations across a "whole range of transnational crimes".Other key concerns, say AFP in official documents, include human trafficking.The AFP documents, presented at recent international crime conferences, have also raised the growing threat to Australia from terrorism.AFP officials have called for cooperation with regional partners to ensure that the "necessary international frameworks are in place" to detect those seeking to join terrorist organisations such as the Islamic State (IS).Security analysts have raised fears that young Australians, being recruited by IS, may be using Thailand as a stopover before travelling to the Middle East to train with IS on forged passports produced in Asia.The potential terrorists are then able to return to Australia on their Australian passports.

Brazilian police on Saturday said they had arrested the first of more than 30 suspects wanted over the gang-rape of a 16-year-old girl whose attackers posted a graphic video online showing the aftermath of their brutal attack.The arrest came as some 70 military police fanned out across a slum west of Rio de Janeiro in a huge operation to apprehend those suspected of taking part in the assault that has shocked Brazil.The detained suspect, who was not identified, was being interrogated, said police, who vowed to bring the other alleged attackers to justice. Social media networks erupted with outrage over the footage posted on Wednesday featuring the girl naked on a bed and the apparent attackers bragging that she had been raped by more than 30 men.They are suspected of assaulting her on May 21 in Rio de Janeiro, a city stricken by violent crime and which will host the Olympic Games in August. Hundreds rallied outside the Legislative Assembly in Rio de Janeiro. (AAP) "Those who committed this heinous crime will be found, will be imprisoned and condemned," Justice Minister Alexandre de Morais told a news conference in Rio Friday night.Brazil's acting president Michel Temer said: "It is absurd that in the 21st century we should have to live with barbaric crimes such as this."The video has horrified a country not unused to violent crime.The UN women's rights agency condemned the case along with another recent alleged gang-rape of a 17-year-old girl in the northeastern state of Piaui."Apart from the fact that these are young women, these barbaric cases are similar in that the teenagers were lured by their attackers in premeditated plots," UN Women in Brazil spokeswoman Nadine Gasman said on Thursday."They were violently attacked in a context of illegal drug use."Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Rio Friday night waving signs saying "Machismo Kills." and "No means no."In Sao Paulo, protesters erected a mural with messages including "My body is not yours," and "I like to wear necklines, that's not an invitation to rape me."

Workers at the Cincinnati Zoo in the US state of Ohio shot and killed a gorilla on Saturday after a three-year-old boy fell into its enclosure, officials said.The boy crawled through a barrier into the enclosure and fell into a moat around 4 pm (1600 GMT), zoo director Thane Maynard told reporters.The gorilla, a 17-year-old male named Harambe weighing more than 180 kilograms, "went down and got him," he said. Witnesses said the gorilla dragged the screaming boy around the habitat, local media reported.The zoo's dangerous animal response team shot and killed the gorilla around 10 minutes after the boy first entered it.He was hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening, media quoted the police as saying. Zoo workers thought it was too risky to just tranquillise Harambe. (Cincinnati Zoo) Harambe with the child. (WLWT) The zoo's response team decided to shoot the gorilla rather than tranquilize him because a tranquilizer would not have taken effect immediately, Maynard said."It seemed by our own dangerous animals response team to be a life-threatening situation," he said. "They saved that little boy's life."The zoo houses 11 gorillas, according to its website."We've never had a situation like this," Maynard said.

A six-year-old boy's emotional reaction to a video of animals eating plastic trash has transformed into a powerful message about environmental sustainability. Henry Marr, from Mount Vernon, Washington, was caught on camera having a tearful conversation with his mother, Allie Hall after school. "The planet is gonna be wrecked," he said. "People are just being rude to it. They throw trash on the ground, they cut down trees, they make forests into places, into roads."They need to think about what they are doing and what they are doing to the planet and what they are doing to animals." Ms Hall told BuzzFeed News that Henry had previously dressed up as a park ranger for Halloween and was interested in nature and the environment, but had become particularly upset after watching the video at school. The video of Henry's reaction has since had more than 2.2 million views. "They are being so bad," he said. "I could just call them dumb people, or maybe even a bad word, the 's' word (stupid)." "I wish I was an adult right now," he says. "I just want to do my job right now." While he waits to grow up, Henry will make posters that ask people not to litter.  ninemsn 2016 Buzz World US Environment Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

She said she had not even known her son was back in the country. Her daughter, Jennifer Riggs, 26, had orchestrated the reunion after her mum told her shed always wanted one of those emotional reunions between loved ones and soldiers she had seen online.

Clergymen should make themselves available to their flocks day and night instead of keeping visiting hours and relaxing once the church doors close, Pope Francis said Sunday."One who serves cannot hoard his free time; he has to give up the idea of being the master of his day," the pontiff said in a homily in Saint Peter's Basilica to mark the Church's Jubilee of Deacons."It deeply troubles me when I see a timetable in a parish: 'From such a time to such a time'. And then? There is no open door, no priest, no deacon, no layperson to receive people. This is not good," he said. The 79-year old said clergymen should welcome "those who knock on those doors at odd hours, even if that entails setting aside something he likes to do or giving up some well-deserved rest".He also stressed the importance of priests and deacons being mild-mannered, saying: "Never shout, never".Deacons from around the world and their families convened in Rome this weekend to take part in special jubilee as part of Francis' Jubilee year which is dedicated to the theme of mercy.In a shock move earlier this month, the Argentine pontiff said he would set up a commission to study the possibility of women entering the Catholic clergy as deacons, in a potentially historic move for the Church.

Snowday is famous for its grilled cheese sandwiches. (Facebook) The next phase sees a pay rise to US$11, with the fellows learning how to manage the truck from top to bottom  including cooking, customer service and management.

One man was killed and several people, including children, were injured Saturday as lightning strikes hit parts of Europe, including a park in Paris and a football pitch in Germany.In southern Poland a man in his forties was killed when he was struck by lightning as he descended the Babia Gora mountain, local media said.Three others were injured by lighting in the region while a 61-year-old man drowned in floodwaters, according to TVN24 television and PAP news agency. In Germany, more than 30 people were taken to hospital in the western village of Hoppstaedten when lightning struck the pitch at the end of a children's football match.Most of those affected were children, who were taken to hospital as a precaution and were found to be unharmed.However three adults were seriously injured including the 45-year-old referee who was hit directly and had to be resuscitated before being rushed to hospital by helicopter.In Paris, 11 people, eight of them children, were injured when lightning struck as they were celebrating a birthday party in Parc Monceau in the city's northwest.Professor Pierre Carli, director of Necker hospital in Paris, said later that only one child was in a very serious condition and had required resuscitation.All the children at the party were aged between seven and eight years old.Paris fire service spokesman Eric Moulin said the group had rushed under a tree to shelter when it began to rain."It was while they were heading for shelter, when they were still near a tree, that the lightning fell," Moulin said.Witnesses to the German lightning strike said it happened without warning."There was no rain and the sky wasn't dark," a police spokesman told DPA.Twenty-nine children aged between nine and 11 were taken to hospital for tests, where they were given the all-clear, a police spokeswoman told AFP. White-and-red tape is strung across a sandy pathway through Park Monceau after a lightning stike. (AP) In Paris, fire service spokesman Moulin said it was an off-duty firefighter who had given the first aid, after hearing the commotion and rushing to help.Emergency services were on the scene, with 29 fire engines mobilised.The injured were taken to Paris hospitals including Necker hospital, a specialist children's facility.Authorities at Necker have set up a psychological and medical support cell to assist the families of the victims.The area of the park where the lightning struck was fenced off with caution tape, while two kids' jackets, still soaking wet from the rain, could be seen hanging on the fence.Local official Vincent Baladi, speaking to iTELE television, said the injuries included burns.Located in a well-heeled neighbourhood of the city's northwest, Parc Monceau is popular with families at the weekend.While lightning usually strikes individual people, it is possible for whole groups to be struck at once.Michel Daloz of weather agency Meteo-France told AFP that between 100 and 200 people are struck by lightning every year in the country, killing between 10 and 20 people. He stressed that people should never head under trees during storms -- as the group did in the Parisian park -- as they often attract lightning."It's what we call the 'lightning rod effect'," said Daloz. In the case of Parc Monceau, he added, "the floor was wet, so it conducted much more strongly."Victims of lightning strikes can suffer lasting cardiological and neurological effects, Daloz said.Storm alerts had been issued for several regions across southern France on Saturday, warning of the possibility of "violent" weather -- but Paris, to the north, was not on the list.Torrential rain had halted play at the French Open in Paris for more than two and a half hours on Saturday afternoon.Weather authorities in Germany had also issued storm alerts for the country's west and south on Saturday.Storm Elvira had already hit the west on Friday, bringing torrential rain and hail and flooding roads in some areas.In Rhineland-Palatinate, the state where Hoppstaedten is located, bad weather caused a train to derail on Friday, but there were no injuries.

Forty-five bodies have been recovered and 135 migrants rescued from a semi-sunken ship, the third wrecked in three days in the central Mediterranean.The Italian Navy said on Twitter on Saturday the corpses were being taken to a yet-to-be disclosed Italian port.It added that an additional 629 migrants were picked up over the course of several operations and were also being transported to Italy. In earlier deadly incidents this week, the European Union's naval mission, Eunavfor Med, intervened Thursday to save 96 people from a sinking boat, and said its units had spotted about 20 bodies at sea.They have not been recovered.On Wednesday, the Italian Navy rescued more than 550 people and five bodies after a migrant boat overturned because it had too many people on board. According to survivors, 650 people were on the vessel, suggesting that about 100 passengers are unaccounted for.Most of this week's rescues took place about 55 kilometres north of the Libyan city of Zuwarah, a well-known hub for migrant smugglers and departure point for Europe-bound sea journeys.The number of arrivals to Italy is expected to surge in the coming months as warmer weather facilitates more departures from Libya.Since Monday, Italian authorities have coordinated the rescue of more than 12,000 sea migrants. This compares with just 1641 arrivals last week, according to figures compiled by the International Organization for Migration.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
An aunt and uncle of Kim Jong-un defected to the United States nearly 20 years ago and are living a middle class life a few hours drive from New York City, the Washington Post reports.Ko Yong-suk, 60, the sister of Kim's mother and her husband, Ri Gang, told the newspaper they run a dry-cleaning business and have raised their three children as US citizens.Ko, who looked after Kim when he was at school in Bern, Switzerland, revealed a number of things about Kim's life, including that he was born in 1984 - not 1982 or 1983, as has been believed - and that he became so obsessed with basketball as a child he slept with a ball. Ko said they lived like a normal family in Switzerland, a life that included trips to Disneyland in Paris, skiing in the Swiss Alps and swimming on the French Riviera.Kim wasn't a troublemaker, Ko said, "but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance".Ko and Ri said when they defected in 1998, the CIA took them to a US military base in Germany and questioned them for several months before they were moved to the US. They said they didn't have the kind of information the agency was looking for because they had "nothing to do with defence".They defected when Ko's sister was sick with terminal breast cancer, fearing they would not be needed by the regime much longer.The Washington Post said two of its reporters spent 20 hours talking with Ko and Ri in New York City and at their home several hours' drive away.The newspaper did not publish the names they use in the US or reveal exactly where they live.Ri said he would like to return to North Korea and help bridge the gap between the US and Pyongyang."If Kim Jong-un is how I remembered he used to be, I would be able to meet him and talk to him," he said.Ko said she doesn't want to go back.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Melbourne rugby union player and accused attempted sex trafficker Michael Quinn will remain in jail in the US, awaiting his June 6 court hearing after dropping his bail application.The 33-year-old was in the US to play in a rugby tournament when he was arrested in a Los Angeles area hotel last Saturday, after he allegedly attempted to pay $US250 to have sex with a six-year-old boy. Mr Quinn smiled and appeared in good spirits during his US District Court appearance overnight, despite the serious charges and his wrists and ankles being shackled. His court-appointed public defender, Lisa Labarre, told Judge Karen Stevenson they were dropping the bail bid they had indicated they would make earlier in the week. Michael Quinn, 33. (AAP) Thom Mrozek, of the US Justice Department, told 9NEWS he did not believe Mr Quinn should be allowed out on bail."He should be held without bond, no amount of money should get him out," he said. Judge Stevenson confirmed Mr Quinn would remain behind bars, telling him there was a serious risk he would flee and, because of the serious nature of his charges, there were concerns for the safety of the public if he was released."The defendant is remanded to the custody of the United States Marshals," she said. A preliminary hearing has been set for June 6. Mr Quinn is being held in downtown Los Angeles' Metropolitan Detention Center. Mr Quinn was arrested by US agents in a Los Angeles area hotel. (AAP) US authorities allege Mr Quinn, who had flown to Los Angeles on May 19 and had been staying at a Hollywood Hills home, had agreed to pay a pimp to have sex with a six-year-old boy at a party in an hotel room attended by pedophiles. The pimp and pedophiles, however, were undercover US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and Mr Quinn was arrested at the hotel room. He was charged with one count of attempted sex trafficking of a minor and one count of travelling to the US for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor."The fact that he showed up at the predetermined location and paid money that he knew was supposed to used to have sex with the child, we believe that that speaks very clearly," Mr Quinn said.The sex trafficking charge carries a maximum sentence of life, without the possibility of parole.According to an affidavit, US special agents launched an investigation into Mr Quinn earlier this month, after undercover agents met him "on a social networking site that caters to individuals with a sexual interest in children".Mr Quinn allegedly told agents he wanted to "meet up with a dad who shares his young ones" in Los Angeles.He allegedly said he wanted to meet "other pervs" and agreed to pay $250 (A$350) for a young boy with whom he planned to have sex.Mr Quinn had allegedly planned to then fly from Los Angeles to Nashville, Tennessee, to play in this week's Bingham Cup - a rugby tournament honouring September 11 hero and pioneer of gay rugby clubs, Mark Bingham.  ninemsn 2016 6pm Newas US Victoria World Crime Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
An indie pop singer has filed a copyright violation lawsuit against Justin Bieber, claiming the distinctive vocal riff in the Canadian superstars hit Sorry is stolen.Casey Dienel, who performs under the stage name White Hinterland, filed the lawsuit and said she was entitled to "substantial" profits from Bieber's song, Rolling Stone reports.Ring the Bell, a track from Dienels third album Baby, released in early 2014, opens with a repeated four-note progression sung by her before synthesisers come in. Sorry, from Biebers November album Purpose is also built on a repeated vocal riff.The lawsuit filed in a federal court in Nashville states that any ordinary lay listener would instantly recognise the sample and similarity between the songs.Biebers team is accused of taking the vocal riff from Dienels song and sampling, distorting and using it without her permission. Electronic music producer Skrillex, real name Sonny Moore, who is also named in the lawsuit, has since posted a clip online disputing the claims the riff was stolen. SORRY but we didn't steal this, he wrote on Twitter alongside the video. The clip shows the producer re-creating the riff from Sorry using an a-cappella demo of the song sung by co-wroter Julia Michaels. Moore manipulates the short clip, talking the viewer through the process step-by-step until he ends up with a vocal clip which sounds very similar to Dienels from Ring the Bell, but is clearly not.In a statement posted to Facebook yesterday Dienel said many of her fans had noticed the similarity between the two songs. As many of you that follow my career and work have already recognized, Justin Biebers song Sorry copies the vocal riff prominently featured in my song Ring the Bell, she wrote. The writers, producers, and performers of Sorry did not obtain a license for this exploitation of my work, nor did they obtain or seek my permission. Yesterday afternoon, I filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement against Justin Bieber and the other responsible parties.Bieber could have licensed my song for use in Sorry. But he chose not to contact me.  ninemsn 2016 Entertainment US World Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Footage of children in southwest China climbing an 800m cliff to reach their school has prompted authorities to take action. The only way for the children from Atuler village in Sichuan province to reach their classroom is to scale an 800m rock face using old wooden ladders and ropes. An elevator which used to ferry the children and other villagers to the mountain's base was shut down due to the cost of power and maintenance with most of the local population living on as little as a $1 a day. The village chief said the perilous 90-minute trek is so dangerous up to eight people had died after losing their grip, Being News reports. To ensure the safety of the children, many of the kids have opted to board at the school  only returning to the mountaintop twice a month to see their family, The Guardian reports. Footage of the perilous climb has sparked government action with the promise of building a steel staircase until a permanent solution can be found.  ninemsn 2016 9Raw World Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Apple has been accused of removing a lesbian couple from an international version of its Mothers Day advertisement.The video, which was a tribute to all mothers through the eyes of iPhone users worldwide, featured a number of shots of parents with children which was published on May 1.However, inconsistencies were pointed out when French magazine Jeanne noticed a lesbian couple present in the Australian, English, Mexican and Canadian versions were left out of the French and German versions, among others. Instead, the latter versions depict an image of one of the women only.The couple, Melanie and Vanessa Roy, posted an image of themselves with their children earlier this month on Instagram, telling followers the Roy tribe was lucky enough to be part of an Apple commercial.French fans of the couple were quick to express their apologies. Several versions, including the French ad, feature this image with only one woman (Instagram/therealmelroy) I am so embarrassed for the stupid French team from Apple, I am a French follower and am truly inspired by your beautiful family, one user wrote.I dont understand why people are so afraid to show reality, another commented.The couple publish a blog, Mommy Squared.They have written earlier posts urging people to stop and think before passing judgement on different families.We are not all the same and thats what makes the world go round.The original advertisement, which has been posted to YouTube, has been viewed more than 4 million times.Apple has been contacted for comment.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Pro skater Tony Hawk has pulled off a string off tricks - in actual defiance of gravity, on board a famed "vomit comet" plane.Inside the Zero G plane, Hawk alongside fellow pro skater Aaron Jaws Homoki, attempted a series of tricks in complete weightlessness.The pair navigated their way through three different settings  Martian, Lunar and Zero Gravity  colliding with one another constantly as they tried to flip their boards. Hawk became a skating legend when he landed the first 900 at the X-Games in 1999, with many saying at the time it seemed he had defied gravity in order to spin his board two-and-a-half times, turning 90 degrees in the air.We have been battling gravity our whole lives, Hawk told Sony, who orchestrated the stunt, before boarding the plane.Hawk said the stunt gave them the opportunity to try some tricks that weve only ever dreamed about.The pair started out in Martian Gravity, experiencing gravity at a third of their normal weight.Neither of them landed their first couple of tricks, but when they switch to Lunar Gravity, now at one-sixth of their normal body weight, they have a little more luck.They both managed mid-air flips, landing the boards safely on the ground. When they moved into zero-gravity the pair lost complete control, falling into fits of laughter as they attempted a few flips and even tried out some synchronised floating.I have no sense of where I am when we're doing it, Hawk says in the video, after a few failed attempts.So much for the dream list of tricks. You have so many ideas and then once you're weightless, you forget what to do  except to just enjoy it.After a few more attempts they start to get the hang of the practice, managing to land at least a handful of their tricks.  ninemsn 2016 9Raw Buzz sport Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
More than 700 migrants are feared dead in three Mediterranean Sea shipwrecks south of Italy in the last few days as they tried desperately to reach Europe in unseaworthy smuggling boats, the UN refugee agency says.Carlotta Sami, spokeswoman for UNHCR, told The Associated Press that an estimated 100 people are missing from a smugglers' boat that capsized on Wednesday. The Italian navy took horrific pictures of that capsizing even as it rushed to rescue all those thrown into the sea from the boat.She said about 550 other migrants and refugees are missing from a smuggling boat that capsized on Thursday morning after leaving the western Libyan port of Sabratha a day earlier. She says refugees who saw the boat sink told her agency that that boat, which was carrying about 670 people, didn't have an engine and was being towed by another packed smuggling boat before it capsized.About 25 people from the capsized boat managed to reach the first boat and survive, 79 others were rescued by international patrol boats and 15 bodies were recovered.According to survivors, the second boat was carrying about 500 migrants when it started taking on water after about eight hours of navigation. Efforts to empty the water - with a line of migrants passing a few five-litre bailing cans - were insufficient and the boat was completely under water after an hour and a half, police said.At that point, the commander of the first smuggler's boat ordered the tow rope to be cut to the sinking boat.The migrants on the top deck jumped into the sea, while those below deck, estimated at 300, sank with the ship, police said. Of those who jumped into the sea, just 90 were rescued.Survivors identified the commander of the boat with the working engine as a 28-year-old Sudanese man, who has been arrested, police said.In a third shipwreck on Friday, Sami says 135 people were rescued, 45 bodies were recovered and an unknown number of people - many more, the migrants say - are missing.Survivors are being taken to the Italian ports of Taranto and Pozzallo. Sami says the UN agency is trying to gather information with sensitivity considering that most of the new arrivals are either shipwreck survivors themselves or traumatised by what they saw.Italy's southern islands are the main destinations for countless numbers of smuggling boats launched from the shores of lawless Libya each week packed with people seeking jobs and safety in Europe.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
The dead heat in the leaders' debate does not bode well for the rest of the election campaign - or the next government.Malcolm Turnbull stuck to his stump speech about having an economic plan.Bill Shorten strictly adhered to his lines on protecting Medicare and doing more for schools. The two leaders sparred over climate change and asylum seekers.But even these two debate points fell flat as the pair exchanged cheap shots.Turnbull said Shorten would reignite the people smuggling trade.Shorten shot back on climate policy describing Turnbull as "Tony Abbott lite" and dropping in a fresh zinger which was probably workshopped using focus groups."There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you."Despite Labor narrowly leading in the polls, Shorten needed a big lift from the debate but instead merely reinforced the messages of the past three weeks.Politically, the winners from such moribund campaign events will be independents and minor parties who hold the real key to who governs after July 2.The most recent polls show almost one in three voters could cast a ballot for either the Greens or another non-major party or independent.With Shorten on Sunday night pledging Labor would block the coalition's biggest economic pledge - a 10-year corporate tax cut plan - these parties could play a pivotal role post-election.The debate won't shift votes and it appears, at least at this stage, the campaign won't either.The election result remains headed towards a modest swing against Turnbull, delivering a coalition government facing a horrendously complex Senate.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten have gone head to head in their first official debate at the National Press Club in Canberra, arguing on company tax cuts, climate change, health and asylum seekers.The leaders were grilled by three senior political journalists in the hour-long debate, in contrast to the town hall-style people's forum held in western Sydney earlier this month.Their performances were widely regarded as lacklustre on social media. Mr Turnbull opened the debate pitching his national economic plan. "These are times of enormous opportunity and uncertainty, these are times of great challenge," Mr Turnbull said. "These are times when we need a clear economic plan." Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the election was about the next 10 to 20 years. "This election is about ... Labor's positive plans for a strong economy and a fair society," he said. He said Labor's plans would "ensure jobs, education and Medicare".Both leaders were asked how they could be trusted by voters following the unceremonious dumping of leaders in recent years.Political editor of the Australian Financial Review, Laura Tingle asked Mr Turnbull whether he had abandoned things he believed in and whether the nation would see a different Malcolm Turnbull if he was given his own mandate.Mr Turnbull said he was a "well-known quantity in Australian public life". "I did not come into this role as a political activist," he said. "I did not come in here as a political staffer." "I came into this role as an adult, at 50, after a lifetime of working and building businesses." Mr Shorten said Labor had learned its lesson from the "difficult period" of leadership change. "We have demonstrated more unity of purpose than we have in a very long time," he said.Asked whether they would respect each other's mandates should the other party win, Mr Turnbull said it was impossible to know what a Labor government would deliver because it backflipped on policies such as restoring the Schoolkids Bonus. Mr Shorten said Labor would not support the coalition's $50 billion corporate tax cut plan, meaning the coalition would need crossbench support or a Senate majority to get its key economic policy through parliament.CLIMATE CHANGE Asked about climate change and his former support for emissions trading, Mr Turnbull said Australia was playing its part."I stand where I have always stood, recognising that we must take action as a global community to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to protect our environment for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that come thereafter," Mr Turnbull said.Mr Shorten said the prime minister was "Tony Abbott lite" when it came to tackling climate change."Malcolm, whatever happened to the old Malcolm Turnbull on climate change? You were so impressive when you were leading on climate change. Now you're just implementing Tony Abbott's policies," Mr Shorten said. "There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you." Mr Turnbull said it was "another cheap shot".Environment protesters gave the leaders a noisy welcome as they arrived for their head-to-head campaign debate.About a dozen people holding signs calling for action on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef stood outside as the leaders arrived 30 minutes before the debate.COMPANY TAX CUTSLabor will block the coalition's proposed corporate tax cuts in the Senate if the government is returned to power on July 2."I have to say that when it comes to corporate tax cuts Labor doesn't think they're the right idea for this nation - full stop," Mr Shorten said.He said the government's $50 billion tax cut plan was a "very expensive risk", which mirrored the economic strategies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Mr Turnbull said former Labor treasurer Paul Keating cut company tax to boost the economy."Why did he do that? ... For every dollar cut from company tax you get $3 going to labour - the employees - and $4 additional value in GDP," Mr Turnbull said."We are lowering taxes on investment so we get more investment."HEALTH Mr Shorten promised to boost hospitals funding by a "significant dimension". But the opposition leader declined to say whether a Labor government would restore all of the Commonwealth health funding cut from the states in the controversial 2014 budget. "When it comes to our hospitals policy, we won't announce our whole policy platform tonight ... but what I can promise Australians right here, right now, is we will put more funding into hospitals than Mr Turnbull has promised by some significant dimension."ASYLUM SEEKERS Mr Turnbull said people smugglers were telling their customers if Labor was elected "it'll be all on again", after declaring he could "rule out any of the detainees coming to Australia"."The reality is we have to be very firm about this. We do no favours to anybody by being weak on border protection in the way Labor was."He said Labor was a party divided on asylum seeker policy."He claims to be on a unity ticket with me but his party is not," Mr Turnbull said of the opposition leader.Mr Shorten said Mr Turnbull was "playing with fire" with the remarks as he had conceded people smugglers were "watching every nuance in the debate"."Shame on you for giving the people smugglers any hope that they could be back in business," he said to Mr Turnbull."Labor has the same approach as the government when it comes to deterring and defeating the people smugglers." Mr Turnbull was criticised on social media for referring to his upbringing."I was brought up by a single dad who didn't have much money. And he struggled to send me to school, and I had some really charismatic teachers that transformed my life."

Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull have fended off questions about their trustworthiness and ability to deliver on their pledges after the election.Entering the fourth week of a gruelling eight-week election campaign, the prime minister and opposition leader gave lacklustre performances at the first formal leaders' debate on Sunday night.Mr Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott in September to become prime minister, while Mr Shorten played a role in dumping Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. The prime minister answered the question on trust saying he was a "well-known quantity in Australian public life"."I did not come into this role as a political activist," he said. "I came into this role as an adult, at 50, after a lifetime of working and building businesses."Mr Shorten took the question head-on, saying Labor had learned its lesson from the "difficult period" of leadership change."We have demonstrated more unity of purpose than we have in a very long time," he said.Asked whether they would respect each other's mandates should the other party win, Mr Turnbull said it was impossible to know what a Labor government would deliver because it backflipped on policies such as restoring the Schoolkids Bonus.Mr Shorten said Labor would not support the coalition's $50 billion corporate tax cut plan, meaning the coalition would need crossbench support or a Senate majority to get its key economic policy through parliament.The debate got heated when the prime minister suggested people smugglers would use a Labor government as a "marketing opportunity" to get back into business."Shame on you," Mr Shorten said.The Labor leader described Mr Turnbull as "Tony Abbott lite" when it came to tackling climate change, given the prime minister had walked away from his previous support for an emissions trading scheme."There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you," Mr Shorten said.Mr Turnbull said it was "another cheap shot".In his opening statement, Mr Turnbull said it was a time of enormous opportunity and uncertainty, which needed a "clear economic plan".Mr Shorten said the election was about the next 10 to 20 years."This election is about ...

TURNBULL AND SHORTEN GO HEAD TO HEADTHEIR OPENING SPIEL* Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull: "My government has set out a national economic plan, every single element of which will create stronger economic growth and more and better jobs for Australians in the future." * Labor leader Bill Shorten: "This election is about a strong economy and a fair society.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Malcolm Turnbull has opened the first formal leaders' debate pitching his national economic plan.Mr Turnbull says that these are times of enormous opportunity and uncertainty, these are times of great challenge.He says these are times when Australia needs a clear economic plan. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the election was about the next 10 to 20 years."This election is about ... Labor's positive plans for a strong economy and a fair society," he said.Labor's plans would "ensure jobs, education and Medicare".The government's $50 billion tax cut plan was a "very expensive risk", which mirrored the economic strategies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.Mr Turnbull said former Labor treasurer Paul Keating cut company tax to boost the economy."Why did he do that? ... For every dollar cut from company tax you get $3 going to labour - the employees - and $4 additional value in GDP," Mr Turnbull said.Asked about climate change and his former support for emissions trading, Mr Turnbull said Australia was playing its part."I stand where I have always stood, recognising that we must take action as a global community to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to protect our environment for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that come thereafter."Both leaders were asked how they could be trusted by voters given that they had been involved in dumping their own parties' leaders in recent years.Mr Turnbull said he was a "well-known quantity in Australian public life"."I did not come into this role as a political activist," he said."I did not come in here as a political staffer."I came into this role as an adult, at 50, after a lifetime of working and building businesses."Mr Shorten said Labor had learned its lesson from the "difficult period" of leadership change."We have demonstrated more unity of purpose than we have in a very long time," he said.Mr Shorten said the prime minister was "Tony Abbott lite" when it came to tackling climate change."There's a big difference between me and Mr Turnbull - I genuinely lead my party whereas your party genuinely leads you," Mr Shorten said.Mr Turnbull said it was "another cheap shot".

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Doctors insist a campaign set to hit television screens is all about patients and not about them.The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners claims the federal government's extended freeze on Medicare rebates will eventually cost individual doctors about $50,000 a year."But it's not about doctors' income whatsoever," president Frank Jones told Sky News on Sunday. The ads, which go to air on Sunday, feature a husband imploring his wife to see the doctor about frequent headaches."Putting it off is not going make it better," he tells her after she says the family can't afford it.The catchline is "your wealth should never affect your health".Mr Jones denied the campaign was political, saying it was more about emphasising the "wonderful care" GPs provided to the community.The freeze would make it really hard for practices to continue providing that care, he said.The government in its May 3 budget extended the freeze on indexed Medicare rebates to 2020.It argues the financial impact on doctors is about 60 cents for each consultation now, rising to $2.50 in four years.Mr Jones warns if the freeze continues, doctors would have to start charging patients an extra $15 as fewer of them are bulk-billed.The government counters that argument by pointing to a bulk-billing rate that has risen to a record 85 per cent since the freeze was introduced by Labor in 2014.The GPs are getting support from new Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon who said his colleagues were at "breaking point" and couldn't take too many more cuts."We think there's an opportunity for the coalition to change tack on this policy," he told reporters after his election.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he didn't blame doctors standing up for their patients."The frontline of our healthcare system is hard-working GPs, many of them small businesses," he told reporters in Canberra.The freeze was forcing doctors into the worst of all possible choices.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
The president of the WA regional council that controversially decided not to fly the Aboriginal flag during NAIDOC Week has complained about a lack of government funding for services to help the town's delinquent youths.The Carnarvon council was equally divided in voting on the matter at a meeting last week, until president Karl Brandenburg cast the deciding no, prompting local MP Vince Catania to call for all nine councillors to be sacked.But Mr Brandenburg insists deep social issues plaguing the fishing town's indigenous youth are more pressing problems than the symbolic importance of a flag, saying various applications have been made for federal and state funds but the best Carnarvon got was $100,000 for a community outreach program. He wants to see services such as drop-in centres for at-risk youth funded by WA's Royalties for Regions program and the federal government's Indigenous Advancement Strategy."We had a certain amount of funding to bring these kids into buildings that we've built down on our sports oval," he told AAP."So those kids who have been kicked out of school for their bad behaviour were taken on by our youth department, which has got four or five people in it, and we deal with the issue."We've got a $50 million courthouse/police station, which is total over-representation for a community of 5000-odd people. So we've got this massive monument. By jeez, it would be nice to have half of that to put towards the youth programs."Nationals WA leader Terry Redman has joined Mr Catania in criticising the council over the flag furore, tweeting: "Not good enough Shire of Carnarvon. Show some leadership and respect."

'Defence ignoring Qld toxic water: Xenophon'
[ URL OF ARTICLE ]

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Independent senator Nick Xenophon has taken his campaign into the southern Queensland seat of Groom, calling for Defence to stop ignoring Oakey's "toxic water nightmare".Groundwater in the small town, 154km west of Brisbane, has been contaminated by chemicals contained in firefighting foam that was used for decades in training activities at the local army aviation centre.Senator Xenophon says the Department of Defence must pay for regular blood testing of residents and compensate landholders following a collapse in property values, as well as those with health issues. "They can't just keep ignoring this," he told AAP."The issue is Defence has an obligation (to act) ... are they worried about setting a precedent for around the country where they used these fire retardants?"The Department of Defence says it is taking the matter seriously and is working with other agencies on the issue, which may also affect civilian airports, industrial sites and state firefighting facilities.The firefighting foams that have contaminated Oakey groundwater contain perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOA) chemicals, which have been linked to adverse health effects including cancers.The Oakey contamination was the subject of a Senate report earlier this month, which received many submissions from residents concerned about elevated levels of the chemicals in their blood.Brad Hudson, whose property is near the army base, said his five-year-old daughter already had a high level of PFOS in her blood."God knows how this will effect her in her future life," he said in his submission."My levels are extremely high and concerning since I have already had testicular cancer at my age of 42."The Senate committee recommended the Department of Defence fund an annual program of blood tests for Oakey residents.Senator Xenophon said the department had only funded tests for 75 residents and was resisting paying for others.But a Defence spokesperson said most Australians would have some level of PFOS and PFOA in their bodies and that testing could create anxiety.The department said it was continuing to supply potable water to households in the investigation area who use bore water for drinking.Results of a Defence analysis to predict the movement of PFOS and PFOA in aquifers beneath and surrounding the Oakey Army Aviation Centre are due for public release in August.Meanwhile, Shine Lawyers are investigating a potential environmental claim and legal action on behalf of affected landholders.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
A decision on the future of schooling in the troubled indigenous township of Aurukun won't be rushed and will be driven by the community, Queensland's premier says.Annastacia Palaszczuk has promised a review into Aurukun's only school, to begin this week, will take the concerns of elders and the local council on board."We need to listen to the community about what is the best education service for the students," she said on Sunday. "We're not going to rush this, we are going to get it right."Elders have already floated a "tough love" approach that would involve taking troubled teens out bush to work on cattle stations and hunt, which Ms Palaszczuk said was a good idea.The review into Noel Pearson's Cape York Aboriginal Australian Academy campus was ordered on Friday after the school was closed for a second time in a fortnight due to safety concerns.Mr Pearson, whose education model has been under fire, has accused the government of using the school as a scapegoat when it decided to close it on Wednesday.Staff members were evacuated after children as young as six allegedly threw rocks at security guards and attempted to break into a car near the teachers' accommodation.The school's principal, Scott Fatnowa, has also been car-jacked twice in two weeks.Queensland Teachers' Union president Kevin Bates has also said the Aurukun community needs to be involved in deciding the future direction of the school.An experienced principal and two teachers will be flown to Aurukun on Monday to support students in a distance education program being run out of the local PCYC.The school, which has 300-odd students, will remain closed until at least the start of term three.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Vulgar Facebook posts have come back to haunt a Liberal candidate for the 2017 West Australian election, with the opposition leader calling for him to be dumped.WA Labor leader Mark McGowan urged Premier Colin Barnett to act after abusive eight-year-old posts by Daniel Parasiliti, who is taking on former Labor state minister Michelle Roberts in the seat of Midland, emerged in a News Corp report on Sunday.The posts include a graphic and demeaning sexual comment to a woman who challenged Mr Parasiliti's views about Kevin Rudd's 2008 apology to indigenous Australians. Mr McGowan said it was common for online commentary to be irreverent, satirical and sarcastic, but Mr Parasiliti's posts were "beyond appalling"."That sort of commentary is the sort of stuff that would make Donald Trump blush," he told reporters."If I was the premier, I'd be removing him as a candidate today."If the premier doesn't act, what I'd say to every female voter in Midland and every male voter who respects women: Don't vote for the Liberal Party."Asked about Mark Reed, a WA Labor Senate candidate who likened businesswoman Gina Rinehart to a Star Wars character in social media posts, Mr McGowan replied: "Attempts at humour sometimes fall flat."Online posts opposing same-sex marriage and indigenous recognition ostensibly contributed to the downfall of a West Australian Liberal candidate in the federal election, Sherry Sufi.He decided to step down as the party's candidate for Fremantle after a community newspaper revealed he was caught on tape in 2013 using crude sexual language while mocking his former boss, WA MP Michael Sutherland.A spokeswoman for Mr Barnett declined to comment on Mr Parasiliti.

Apple has been accused of removing a lesbian couple from an international version of its Mothers Day advertisement.The video, which was a tribute to all mothers through the eyes of iPhone users worldwide, featured a number of shots of parents with children which was published on May 1.However, inconsistencies were pointed out when French magazine Jeanne noticed a lesbian couple present in the Australian, English, Mexican and Canadian versions were left out of the French and German versions, among others. Instead, the latter versions depict an image of one of the women only.The couple, Melanie and Vanessa Roy, posted an image of themselves with their children earlier this month on Instagram, telling followers the Roy tribe was lucky enough to be part of an Apple commercial.French fans of the couple were quick to express their apologies. Several versions, including the French ad, feature this image with only one woman (Instagram/therealmelroy) I am so embarrassed for the stupid French team from Apple, I am a French follower and am truly inspired by your beautiful family, one user wrote.I dont understand why people are so afraid to show reality, another commented.The couple publish a blog, Mommy Squared.They have written earlier posts urging people to stop and think before passing judgement on different families.We are not all the same and thats what makes the world go round.The original advertisement, which has been posted to YouTube, has been viewed more than 4 million times.Apple has been contacted for comment. The image appears only on some versions of the tech giant's advertisement (Instagram/therealmelroy)  ninemsn 2016 Buzz Technology World Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Queensland vets will drop de-sexing fees during a campaign encouraging pet owners to be more responsible.More than two dozens councils are taking part in the RSPCA campaign, with 170 of the state's vets reducing their de-sexing fees by at least 20 per cent.RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says about 45,000 animals come into the organisation's care every year and most have not been de-sexed. "There is a massive pet over-population all over Queensland and of course Australia," he said.Organisers hope the annual drive, which was launched on Saturday, will result in 30,000 animals undergoing the procedure.Environment Minister Dr Steven Miles says feral cats have almost wiped out bilbies at Currawinya and Astrebla Downs National Parks."Anything responsible pet owners can do to reduce this threat to our native wildlife - both in our national parks and in our own backyards - will help to make a real difference to our environment," he said.

A new report has revealed the Pentagon still uses a 1970s-era computer system, as well as 8-inch floppy disks.The Government Accountability Office findings, reported by the BBC, highlighted the outdated technology used by the Department of Defense, including at its Pentagon headquarters.The report identified the Pentagon as one of several departments where "legacy systems" urgently needed to be replaced. "This system remains in use because, in short, it still works," Pentagon spokeswoman Lt Col Valerie Henderson said in response to the report. "However, to address obsolescence concerns, the floppy drives are scheduled to be replaced with secure digital devices by the end of 2017." "Modernisation across the entire Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications enterprise remains ongoing." The Pentagon was planning to fully replace the system by the end of 2020. The report said taxpayers spent AU$84.49 billion (US$61 billlion) a year on maintaining aging technologies. It said that was three times more than the investment on modern IT systems.  ninemsn 2016 US Technology 9live Buzz World Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Driverless vehicles could soon be tested on Queensland's roads for the first time.Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey told parliament on Thursday the government was working with the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) to integrate "connected and automated vehicles" on to the state's road network."The department is currently negotiating a joint agreement with Bosch and QUT's Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety to test cooperative and highly-automated vehicles on our roads," he said. Mr Bailey stressed earlier this week at a technology summit that negotiations were in their early stages.Test sites had not yet been decided, he said.But Mr Bailey said Queenslanders should start getting used to the idea of cars doing the driving for them. "I think people need to realise that automated vehicles are not something that's off in the distant science fiction future," he said."It's actually going to happen in their lifetimes and much earlier in their lifetimes than people realise."Driverless vehicles were tested in Australia for the first time late last year in Adelaide.

"'Dogs from puppy farms more aggressive'"

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Dogs bred on intensive puppy farms grow up to be more aggressive, fearful and anxious than pets from reputable breeders, a scientific study has found.Animal behaviour experts have conducted the first UK study of how the first few weeks of a dog's life in a puppy farm can have a serious effect on its temperament as an adult.The Newcastle University team assessed pugs, chihuahuas and jack russells from reputable breeders and from puppy farms. The puppies' backgrounds were assessed by asking the owners questions such as if they saw the mother, if health documents were available and the age at which they got the puppy.The owners were then asked to assess their adult dog using a test called the Canine Behaviour and Research Questionnaire.This included whether their dog was aggressive; if it was afraid of new things or loud noises and whether it suffered separation-related problems. The test also assessed obedience.Dr Catherine Douglas, a lecturer in animal science and research supervisor said puppy farms were usually businesses that produced a lot of dogs for sale, but the study also considered smaller breeders with poor welfare standards.She said: "There has been some research around the health problems associated with dogs from puppy farms but very little research into long-term effects on adult dog behaviour."We found that across all behaviour categories, including trainability, dogs from less responsible breeders had significantly less favourable behaviour and temperament scores than puppies from responsible breeders."That was likely to be down to the poor environment both before and after birth.Dr Douglas said: "Previous studies have shown that mothers who are stressed or poorly fed during pregnancy had more anxious and less trainable offspring."Early separation from the mother has been found to be detrimental and the direct effect on the puppies of their early experiences in these less-than-ideal environments is also likely to be a factor."

Two Perth schools have recruited a special French-designed robot in a bid to help improve their students education experience.The humanoid robot, NAO, will be employed in one school  Waikiki Primary School  to help teach students with autism functional and social skills, while also enhancing science lessons, Perth Now reports.The $16,450 robot is also being used to assist senior students at Perth College with learning how to write computer code, while making conventional maths and science classes for juniors more enjoyable. Perth College teacher Jesse Ussi believes the robots presence in the classroom will assist pupils with learning 21st century skills.The robots themselves are one part of the whole picture were trying to paint, he said.The move by Waikiki Primary and Perth College comes in the wake of growing interest in robots as teaching aides.Already in Victoria, NAO robots are employed to help children participating in physical therapy.In South Australia, a three-year trial is investigating the usefulness of androids to help boost pupil engagement and academic performance.A number of Queensland libraries also currently use NAO to assist with storytelling, teaching programming to visitors and educating children about cyber safety.  ninemsn 2016 Technology Buzz National Western Australia Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
There is some good news for Twitter users today, with the social media giant today announcing it is easing its 140-character limit for tweets. The move comes as Twitter's efforts to increase its user base and engagement have dipped, raising questions about its growth trend. "Over the past decade, the tweet has evolved from a simple 140-character text message to a rich canvas for creative expression featuring photos, videos, hashtags, Vines and more," Twitter product manager Todd Sherman said in a statement. "So, you can already do a lot in a tweet, but we want you to be able to do even more. In the coming months, we'll make changes to simplify tweets, including what counts toward your 140 characters." Mr Sherman said names in replies, and media attachments such as photos, videos and polls will no longer be counted toward the character limit. He added that updates would be implemented "over the coming months" and that developer partners would be given the tools to enable the change on sites that use Twitter. Relaxing the 140-character limit, which was set due to mobile phone text messaging constraints in place when Twitter launched in 2006, is expected to encourage more use and sharing of pictures, videos and links. The changes dont stop there, with the statement also revealing other tweaks were being made to how Twitter works. One new feature will enable users to retweet or "quote" their own messages "when you want to share a new reflection or feel like a really good one went unnoticed." Twitter will also broadcast the "reply" tweet to all followers of a given user. This will eliminate the need for a sometimes misunderstood technique in which users had to add a character to a reply to allow it to be viewed broadly. The change allows more room for tweets and "should be very welcome news for both Twitter users and advertisers," Matt McGee from the blog Search Engine Land said. "It means more room for text and conversation in each tweet and less frustration for everyone who's been forced to edit their words in order to fit them inside Twitter's constraints." Mr McGee added that because the new rules apply to "promoted" tweets or ads, the new format gives marketers "more room to tell their story or pitch their products and services with both text and media." Debra Aho Williamson at the research firm eMarketer welcomed the "long overdue" changes. "I think Twitter is taking steps in the right direction by removing some of these limitations," she said. "That said, much of the social media world is moving toward communicating via video, and I'd love to see Twitter make video more of a centerpiece of the service." Greg Sterling of the Local Search Association, a marketing trade group, also played down the change as "incremental" for Twitter's efforts. "It's a positive move and will enhance usage," Sterling said. However, Mr Sterling said Twitter is struggling because it has not kept pace with other big networks like Facebook and Instagram. "Facebook, Instagram and others have sucked some of the engagement out of the room for people to share pictures and other content, and they are preempting Twitter," he said. Last month, Twitter released a quarterly update that showed little change in its user base. In a key metric in the fast-evolving social media world, Twitter's trend was flat. The number of monthly active users was 310 million, up three percent from a year ago and only slightly higher than the 305 million in the previous quarter.

An Israeli start-up claims it has developed a software program that can identify terrorists, pedophiles and ace poker players by analysing their facial features. Faception says the technology can determine character traits in peoples faces that are undetectable to the naked eye and has an accuracy of 80 percent. Using photographs, the software successfully identified nine out of the 11 Paris attackers as terrorists. The start-up has already signed a contract with a homeland security agency to help identify terrorists, The Washington Post reports. At a recent amateur poker tournament, the technology was used to predict which four players would play the best. Of the four, two ended up among the events three finalists. The software program has been developed to test for 15 different classifications. Aside from terrorists and poker players, the company claims it can spot extroverts, pedophiles, geniuses and white collar-criminals. We understand the human much better than other humans understand each other, Shai Gilboa, Faception chief executive, said. Our personality is determined by our DNA and reflected in our face. It's a kind of signal. However, experts have expressed their disquiet about the technology which could see people placed under suspicion before they have even committed a crime. Can I predict that you're an axe murderer by looking at your face and therefore should I arrest you?

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Music streaming service Spotify netted $3 billion revenue last year but is still in the red, according to its earnings report. The report revealed the Swedish company's losses deepened last year, even as its revenue increased amid the global boom in online music.Spotify was founded in 2008 and has been at the forefront of the music industry's turn to streaming, which offers unlimited music on demand, yet it has never turned a profit itself. The Luxembourg-based holding company Spotify Technologies submitted its annual earnings report yesterday, and said its revenue jumped 80 per cent to 1.95 billion euros (AU$3.03 billion) last year.The growth rate is significantly stronger than the 45 per cent it charted in 2014 and slightly higher than the 74 percent seen in 2013."In many ways, it was our best year ever," the company said in a message to shareholders, describing Spotify as the top driver of growth for the entire music industry.The company said its revenue from advertisements nearly doubled and that its user base also grew significantly.Spotify said it had 89 million active monthly users by the end of last year, up from 60 million in 2014. It had 28 million subscribers, who were paying for the service.The company's founder, Daniel Ek, had said in March that Spotify reached 30 million paying subscribers.But the growth did not erase losses, with Spotify putting a priority on investments at a stage when streaming is increasingly becoming mainstream.The company's net losses totaled 173 million euros (AU$268 million), nearly seven per cent more than a year before."We believe our model supports profitability at scale," the company said."We believe that we will generate substantial revenues as our reach expands and that, at scale, our margins will improve."We will therefore continue to invest relentlessly in our product and marketing initiatives to accelerate reach."Spotify's growth is all the more remarkable as last year marked a pause in its international expansion. It resumed its global push this year, adding Indonesia as its 59th country.But Spotify also faces growing competition - tech giant Apple launched its own streaming service last year and rap mogul Jay-Z has spearheaded rival Tidal, adding to a market that also includes French-based Deezer and US-based Rhapsody.Deezer's revenue stood at 142 million euros (AU$220 million)in 2014, well below Spotify. The company, which put off a market listing in October, has not released figures for last year.Apple does not break down its revenue from streaming. Rhapsody, which also operates as Napster, posted US$202 million (AU$279 million) in revenue last year.Spotify has sought to expand its offerings, starting video content and recently launching a tie-up in the US with Starbucks aimed at bringing in new subscribers.But it has also faced prominent holdouts including Taylor Swift, Adele and Radiohead, who have kept some or all of their music off the service, in part due to objections to its free tier.The soaring growth of subscriptions to Spotify and its rivals led the global music industry to post significant growth for the first time in nearly two decades last year, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.But with an accompanying fall in sales of CDs and digital downloads, some players in the music industry wonder whether streaming will offer healthy margins in the long term.Spotify remains a private company under the control of its founders, Ek and fellow Swede Martin Lorentzon, and has financed its commercial push on its own through investors.A listed shareholder, Swedish telecom firm Telia, last year made it known that Spotify was valued at US$8.2 billion (AU$11.3 billion).

Eliminating hundreds of mobile phone black spots, the bugbear of regional Australians, is the focus of a $60 million coalition promise.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull made the commitment in the Victorian coastal town of Anglesea, in the Liberal marginal seat of Corangamite, on Tuesday.Four communications black spots across the electorate - in Anglesea, Bell Bay and Birragurra - are among 900 across the country in line for funding under the program. Improving connections would help small businesses and ordinary people, Regional Communications Minister Fiona Nash said."Our farmers are now downloading YouTube instructions to fix machinery and sitting in their lounge rooms or their utes using their mobile phones to run their irrigation systems," she told reporters alongside Mr Turnbull."Innovation is not just a city word or a city thing, innovation is happening out in our regions consistently as well."The announcement brings to $220 million the total coalition spend to fix mobile phone black spots.Tony Abbott initiated the program with a $100 million promise during the 2013 election campaign.Some 6000 black spots have been nominated for fixing and about half have been addressed so far.The program is under scrutiny from the commonwealth auditor-general after Labor complained more than four in five new towers had been built in coalition electorates.Its report is due in May.Vodafone says the funding will start to address the black-spot mobile class divide between cities and rural and regional Australia.

Imagine moving a series of massive rock each weighing several tonnes, without the help of modern machinery, beasts of burden or even wheels. For millennia Britons have been trying to figure out how the builders of Stonehenge did just that, but a group of students and academics have discovered it wasn't as hard as previously thought. An experiment from University College London found that moving massive slabs of rock can be done by a group of just 10 people and some judiciously placed pieces of wood. The stones are mounted on a simple sled made of sycamore wood, then dragged along a track of logs by a group of people with some pieces of rope. "We were expecting to need at least 15 people to move the stone so to find we could do it with 10 was quite interesting," PhD student Barney Harris said. "Its true that we did the experiment on flat ground, and there would have been steep slopes to navigate when going through the Presili Mountains, but actually this kind of system works well on rough terrain." Volunteers heave a one-tonne rock during a University College London experiment. (AP) The Telegraph reports a group of students managed to move a one-tonne rock more than three metres a second, faster than 10km/h if pulled continually. Given the rocks at Stonehenge are bigger than the ones used in the experiment, the academics calculated that just 20 stone-age Britons could have transported them. The biggest rocks at Stonehenge weigh up to 40 tonnes and were produced from local sandstone. But the "bluestones" at the ancient landmark could have only come from dolerite quarries in Wales, more than 250km away. Not a bad effort given Stonehenge was built between 4000 and 5000 years ago.Do you think you know archeology? Have a go at our quiz.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Liberal minister Christopher Pyne has defended his party's globally obsolete National Broadband Network saying Australians don't need fast internet. The Minister for Innovation, Science and Industry faced fierce criticism of the NBN, which will produce some of the slowest internet speeds in the world, when he appeared on Q&A last night. Australia is currently ranked 44th in the world for its connection speeds, below Ireland, Latvia and the Czech Republic. In 2013, Labor's NBN promised download speeds of 1Gbps through an innovative fibre optics network linked directly to people's homes, on par with international standards. However, the Coalition's version which won't be completed until 2020 and will only provide download speeds of 25Mbps, well below the global average. Speaking in defence of the NBN, Mr Pyne said: "(Australian's) simply didn't need the speeds that Labor was promising." "You will be able to watch five full-length movies in the same household if you all want to at the same time. "Which is a lot of movies. That's a lot of televisions." His comments come after a series of AFP raids over leaked documents revealed cost blowouts for the Coalition's network. The leaked documents highlighted the $800 million Optus network was "not fully fit for purpose" and could require more than 470,000 premises to be reconnected. Labor shadow infrastructure and transport spokesman Anthony Albanese said "the NBN isn't about movies, it's about our economy and how it functions". "Malcolm Turnbull's fraud-band is double the cost" and "half the speed of what he said it would be. And the delay is extraordinary," he said. The coalition has also been criticised for pledging to use antiquated copper wiring to support the NBN.  ninemsn 2016 Technology Politics Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Pancreatic cancer patients are significantly more likely to die if they undergo risky procedures at the hands of surgeons who aren't as experienced undertaking such operations, new research shows.A study led by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute compared outcomes from 270 Queensland and NSW patients who underwent pancreatic cancer operations between 2009 and 2011.It found a patient was about three times more likely to die within 90 days of surgery if the procedure was done by a "low-volume" surgeon - one who performed the procedure fewer than four times each year. Patients of such surgeons were also twice as likely to die within a year of their operation, the research found.Surgery to remove tumours for pancreatic cancer patients, which has the worst survival rate of any cancer, is highly complex.QIMR's Associate Professor Rachel Neale said the results did not cast any aspersions on the competency of the surgeons."Our findings suggest that more patients would have better outcomes if this procedure was concentrated into the hands of a smaller number of surgeons," she said."In other words, the evidence suggests that surgery for pancreatic cancer should be super-specialised."The study has been published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
India successfully launched its first mini space shuttle earlier today as New Delhi's famously frugal space agency joined the global race to make rockets as reusable as airplanes.The shuttle was reportedly developed on a budget of just one billion rupees ($20.5 million), a fraction of the billions of dollars spent by other nations' space programmes.The Reusable Launch Vehicle, or RLV-TD, which is around the size of a minibus, hurtled into a blue sky over southeast India after its 7:00am (11am AEST) lift-off. After reaching an altitude of about 70km, it glided back down to Earth, splashing into the Bay of Bengal 10 minutes later.The test mission was a small but crucial step towards eventually developing a full-size, reusable version of the shuttle to make space travel easier and cheaper in the future."We have successfully accomplished the RLV mission as a technology demonstrator," Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) spokesman Devi Prasad Karnik told AFP.The worldwide race for reuseable rockets intensified after NASA retired its space shuttle programme in 2011. They are seen as key to cutting costs and waste in the space industry, which currently loses millions of dollars in jettisoned machinery after each launch. Internet tycoon Elon Musk's SpaceX and Blue Origin of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos have already successfully carried out their own test launches.Musk told reporters in April that it currently costs about $416,000 to fuel a rocket and about $83 million to build one.SpaceX first landed its powerful Falcon 9 rocket in December while Blue Origin's New Shepard successfully completed a third launch and vertical landing in April this year.But ISRO hopes to develop its own version, primarily to cash in on the huge and lucrative demand from other countries to send up their satellites.- Mission to Mars -The Indian space agency is no stranger to stellar achievements on a shoestring budget.It made global headlines in 2013 after sending an unmanned rocket to orbit Mars at a cost of just $101 million. NASA's Maven Mars mission had a $931 million price tag.The launch and its low cost were a source of immense pride in India, which beat rival China in becoming the first Asian country to reach the Red Planet. K. Sivan, a scientist involved in the latest project, said the seven-metre long shuttle survived the test flight, and scientists hope subsequent models six times as big, to be built over the next decade, will glide safely back to land."We have located the place where the vehicle is floating. The landing was soft and the vehicle did not break," Sivan told AFP."The mission went off as planned and data from the experiment showed that we have achieved its objectives and demonstrated the RLV technology."Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the "industrious efforts" of ISRO scientists."Dynamism & dedication with which our scientists & @isro have worked over the years is exceptional and very inspiring," Modi said on Twitter.Modi has often hailed India's budget space technology, quipping in 2014 that a local rocket that launched four foreign satellites into orbit had cost less to make than Hollywood film Gravity.  ninemsn 2016 India Technology space Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

A Christian lobby group has called on the federal government to filter out online pornography for Australian internet users.The Australian Family Association wants a mandatory internet filter, requiring households to opt-in if they want access to adult material.In 2013, the Coalition released a policy document backing the idea of an internet pornography filter. Malcolm Turnbull, who was Shadow Communications Minister at the time, quickly backtracked by saying the document was "poorly worded and incorrect" and reaffirming his opposition to internet filtering. Government emails obtained under Freedom of Information by Crikey have shown that the government is still sensitive about internet filtering.The documents show that in 2015, the Australian Family Association wrote to government eSafety Commissioner Alastair MacGibbon, calling for an internet filter.Emails from Mr MacGibbon to Communications Minister Mitch Fifield reportedly refer to "sensitivities around the concept of filtering for pornography".According to the emails, the government has not changed their policy and remains opposed to a broad internet pornography filter.  ninemsn 2016 Politics Technology Federal National Election 2016 Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Ride-sharing service Uber says while it knows when customers have low phone charge, it doesnt use this fact to pressure them into paying higher fares through surge pricing.During a recent appearance on NPRs Hidden Brain podcast, Ubers head of economic research Keith Chen said battery charge can often reflect a users likeliness to accept fares that have been raised due to surge pricing.One of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge  in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, two-point-two, two-point-three, Ill give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away  is how much battery you have left on your cell phone, Mr Chen said. The Uber app switches into power-saving mode when it senses the users phone battery is running low.Mr Chen insisted the company does not exploit this knowledge for commercial advantage.We absolutely dont use that to  push you a higher surge price, but its an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behaviour, he said.Surge pricing is a controversial practice which involves adding a multiplier to customers fare.Uber says it introduced the system in a bid to get more drivers on the road during periods of peak demand.  ninemsn 2016 Technology World National Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

A team of specialists in Brazil have designed a new 3D printed replacement shell for a tortoise whose armour was destroyed in a bushfire last year.The self-titled Animal Avengers  a Sao Paulo-based volunteer team comprising four vets, a dental surgeon and a 3D designer  used 3D printing technology to help create a new shell for tortoise Freddy, after 85 percent of her original shell was damaged in a forest fire, GC Noticias reports.Designer Cicero Moraes said he was able to design the new shell by comparing photos of other healthy turtles with those of the injured Freddy. I [then] reconstructed a 3D computer imaging model of the complete shell using the tortoise's exact measurements, he told the Daily Mail. Before and after: Freddy receives her new shell. (GC Noticias) The prosthesis, made of four interlocking pieces from corn-derived plastic, were then painted and assembled on the turtles back, restoring her to her former appearance.Freddy  named after the fire-damaged character Freddy Krueger, of Nightmare on Elm Street fame  has since gone on to live in the care of Animal Avenger veterinarian Dr Rodrigo Rabello.Her condition marks a significant improvement from when she was first found in a near-death state in 2015.The Animal Avengers have previously provided their specialised 3D printing service for a range of other animals.Their contributions include artificial beaks for toucans, a parrot and a goose.

International financial messaging service SWIFT has told clients to share information on attacks on the system to help prevent hacking, after criminals used SWIFT messages to steal $US81 million ($A112 million) from the Bangladesh central bank.Reports on Friday also said Wells Fargo, Ecuador's Banco del Austro (BDA) and Citibank, whose managing director, Franchise Risk & Strategy, Yawar Shah, is SWIFT's chairman, did not inform SWIFT of an attack last year in which more than $US12 million was stolen from BDA.The banks and Shah all declined to comment on why. Banks use secure SWIFT messages for issuing payment instructions to one another. The network is considered the backbone of international finance, but faith in its security has been rocked by the theft from Bank Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.SWIFT said in a communication to users on Friday that they should "immediately inform SWIFT of any suspected fraudulent use of their institution's SWIFT connectivity or related to SWIFT products and services".SWIFT spokeswoman Natasha de Teran said banks whose SWIFT systems had been hacked should inform SWIFT. She was unable to say whether banks, such as Wells Fargo, that received messages they later discovered were fraudulent, should inform SWIFT.SWIFT has a role to play in educating its members about cyberthreats, said Doug Johnson, senior risk adviser at the American Bankers Association, noting there were disparate levels of security across financial institutions globally. The ABA is a powerful lobby group for the US banking industry."This is a teachable moment for everybody who uses the SWIFT system to recognise that there is an effort by criminals under way to compromise the end points of companies using that system," Johnson told Reuters after SWIFT communicated to its users on Friday.SWIFT is especially concerned about the use of malware to access interfaces with the SWIFT network. The Belgium-based co-operative, which is owned by its user banks, said it needed technical information from systems that have been compromised with malware to better understand the risks of attack.Malware was used in the hacks on Bank Bangladesh in February and in the BDA case in January 2015.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
Telstra customers have been offered more free data after an "extremely complex" network and modem connection error caused the fourth major network outage this year.Irate customers have lashed out at the telecom giant - which prides itself on having the best network in Australia - over the fault which affected customers around the country.It surfaced early on Friday morning, preventing some NBN and ADSL users connecting to the internet. "Following disruption to some NBN voice and data services and ADSL services today, all services were restored just before 7pm EST this evening," Telstra said in a statement at 2030 AEST."The issue is extremely complex, but in simple terms there was a fault with the device that manages the interaction between our network and all of the different types of customer modems."We understand this has been frustrating for affected customers and we will be providing them with some additional data."News Corp Australia reported that a leaked internal Telstra memo showed the outage affected up to 350,000 NBN voice and data customers in NSW, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia and 25,000 ADSL customers in South Australia and NSW.The memo attributed the problem to a large number of reconnection attempts from customer modems.A Telstra spokesman said the memo "reflected a point in time"."I can confirm that was an internal memo from early this morning," the spokesman told AAP."It reflected a point in time view, noting that these things change rapidly by the minute."Telstra apologised to customers affected by the outage, the fourth service failure from the telco since February."We apologise to customers and are doing everything possible to restore services as quickly as possible," the spokesman said.Irate customers voiced their frustrations on social media."Another outage. Telstra, you are an absolute joke. I don't want free data, I want my money back," Bridie Allen said on Facebook.Ruth Townsend said, "Dear @Telstra, how long will this outage last? How come your billing department never has an outage? Love Ruth.""Another outage, Telstra? We've finally gotten our business phone line working after a week of being down, and now no Internet. Our business is losing money and yet you are happy to keep taking ours," said Catherine Rees.

Ms Riggs, a third grade teacher at Schrader Elementary School, Florida, was in her classroom with her students when suddenly her son walked in. Her mouth dropped open as she began to cry and her son walked over and embraced her as the class cheered them on. It was a moment Ill remember forever and always, Ms Riggs told ABC News. She said she had not even known her son was back in the country. Her daughter, Jennifer Riggs, 26, had orchestrated the reunion after her mum told her shed always wanted one of those emotional reunions between loved ones and soldiers she had seen online. I had told her months ago that I see all these wonderful surprise reunions with military people and I cry every time and I told her, I could have one of those, Ms Riggs said. Sgt. Riggs is now stationed much closer to home, in Virginia.  ninemsn 2016 Good News US World Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

A US food truck is serving up delicious street food with a twist - a side of life-changing opportunity for young people with tainted pasts. Non-profit Drive Change, hires formerly incarcerated youth to work in award winning New York-based food truck Snowday.The food truck is loved for its grilled cheese sandwiches which are served oozing with maple syrup, as well as its farm-fresh homemade fare. We hire, teach and empower young people who are coming home from the criminal justice system, Jordyn Lexton, founder of Drive Change, told Pix 11.Young people between the ages of 17 to 25, who have just come out of the criminal justice system, are eligible for year-long paid fellowships, which consist of three phases.A felony conviction is like the ultimate black eye, Roy Waterman, director of engagement at Drive Change, told Pix 11.No matter how many years pass by its always on your record.In the first phase, fellows earn US$9 an hour and obtain all their necessary food and mobile vendor licenses, under the mentorship of Drive Change coaches. Snowday is famous for its grilled cheese sandwiches. (Facebook) The next phase sees a pay rise to US$11, with the fellows learning how to manage the truck from top to bottom  including cooking, customer service and management. They also undertake professional courses in social media, money management, marketing, and small business development. In the final phase, fellows then work at another placement for four months while continuing their courses. Drive Change continues to pay their wages throughout each phase.Were transparent about what were doing, Mr Lexton told Pix 11. We believe that by having this really positive interaction at our truck, we might actually help to dispel some of the preconceived notions that people have about what is means to be formerly incarcerated.Many of Drive Changes fellows have now secured jobs in restaurants and catering companies. The truck will be travelling all around New York City in the summer months.Have a good news story youd like to share? Wed like to hear from you.

Students at a Maryland school have raised money for a plane ticket so a Nigerian mother could attend her son's high school graduation.Mike Tertsea left his family behind in Nigeria four years ago to study and play basketball in the USA.For his graduation this week, his classmates at the John Carroll School in Bel Air had a surprise for him. They had secretly raised enough money to pay for his mother's visa and flights from Nigeria.According to Mike, this helping hand from his classmates was "the greatest moment" of his life.His mum couldn't believe how different he looked."He's big. Bigger, taller. He's too big, I couldn't recognise him," she told ABC2 Maryland. His mother hadn't seen him for four years. (ABC2 Maryland) "I'm so excited to see my son after four years. It's so good to be here."It was the first time she had been on an airplane.Some of the students involved in the crowdfunding effort were amazed that it all went to plan."It is very hard to get visas, and that we were able to fund it is just phenomenal," one classmate said.The plan almost hit a snag when the students ended up a few hundred dollars short.Incredibly, when asked to chip in, Mike's teachers and coaches raised the remaining money within an hour."God bless them, I thank them so much," his mother said.Have a good news story youd like to share?

Alabama police officers have ignored complaints about a childrens soccer match on a tractor equipment companys property, instead joining in the game and posting footage online.The Birmingham-based officers received multiple calls to end the game on Saturday, but decided the real crime was stopping children from playing outside.Officer Jordan Burke told FOX affiliate WBRC that calling the game off would have gone against the police departments morals. We get calls repeatedly on these guys playing and theres one person who continually calls and asks us to stop them, he said.Im not going to do that. Ethically, I cant tell children to stop playing.Mr Burke said the decision to join in had come from a similar experience he had as a child.When I was a kid, I had a police officer go out of his way to come play football with us, and it made a really positive impact on my life, he said.I hope it would kind of do the same thing for us considering most kids right now are raised to fear the police and thats not what we want. Thats not what we need.The children were thankful for them joining in, and the officers have since returned to the property to play in rematches. Its been great so far to see all these guys come out here to play soccer with us, especially now that we have more people to play on our team, young boy Chuy Cardenas told the news station.Mr Burke posted a video of the first match to Facebook, which has since been viewed more than 300,000 times.Please stop calling the police telling us to tell children to stop playing outside. This will be the result every time, he wrote.He said the amount of positive coverage the gesture had received was overwhelming.The amount of support we have received is out of this world, he wrote.I cant thank you all enough for helping make such a positive impact on these childrens lives.  ninemsn 2016 Good News Buzz World US Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

A tattoo artist in Canberra is giving breast cancer survivors a new lease on life, by performing free nipple tattoos.Peter Bones Bone, the owner of Tatts On Tatts Off, said he had heard there was a gap in the market for the service.It became apparent that it was out of reach for most people (who had had mastectomies or double mastectomies) to have the product done, so I had the bright idea to do free tattooing, Mr Bone told 9news.com.au. The free service started in October last year, and so far around 50 women have taken up the offer. Breast cancer survivors' nipple tattoos. (Facebook) The tattoo artist said the process is fairly simple and takes around an hour and a half.We have an initial consolation with the individual, how long they are post-surgery, identify any residual keloid scaringthen if everything looks like theyre a good candidate, talk about the procedure, talk about the type of nipples theyd like to have in place, he said. Breast cancer survivors' nipple tattoos. (Facebook) Most women sort of appreciate a male perspective, so I generally (look at) whats good for that persons size, that persons shape.Were reconstructing the areola as well as the nipple in some cases.Bones said he offers a free service for two reasons  to help breast cancer survivors and to break the stigma surrounding tattoo artistry.Im doing a community service but Im also helping break the stigma of tattoo studios and further reinforce were not the normal studio, he said. Breast cancer survivors' nipple tattoos. (Facebook) I approach it more from a perspective that its a service as well as an artistic expression.He said his clients say they are extremely appreciative, and he hopes the service will expand.Its just something I do, I get a warm and fuzzy (feeling) for doing it for the women  it seems to give them some closure to their whole experience.To find out more information on Bones service, visit the Tatts On Tatts Off website.  ninemsn 2016 Health Art Australian Capital Territory Buzz Good News National Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
A Melbourne teenager has gathered more than 95,000 signatures to force Aldi Australia to remove caged eggs from its shelves, a move which has divided public opinion.The supermarket giant has confirmed it would completely eradicate caged eggs by 2025 in a statement on its Facebook page, after 14-year-old Angelina Popovski started a change.org petition in March.Weve listened to our customers and we are committed to working with our suppliers towards transitioning to a 100 percent cage-free eggs by no later than 2025, Aldi Australia posted earlier today. We are working with our suppliers to safeguard a sustainable transition, we believe the best outcome for everyone is when the transition is done co-operatively and collaboratively with the industry.Angelina today updated her 97,087 supporters, telling them we won! Way to go Aldi OZ! Angelina Popovski (right) gained more than 95,000 signatures to advocate for change. (Change.org and Facebook) This incredible win shows that if we stay strong, get creative, be consistent, never give up and, most importantly, keep on being kind, there's no end to what we can achieve for animals, she wrote.Angelina began the petition in March after learning about her grandmas chickens, learning how smart and full of personality they are, expressing her contempt for caged hens whose beaks are deliberately cut without painkillerstrampled [and] starved to death.She worked in conjunction with Animals Australia to end caged eggs, begging Aldis Australian arm to follow the lead of its US and European distributors.While the move has been welcomed by supporters, the Egg Farmers of Australia (EFA) has hit back at the decision.Aldis decision will hurt Australian egg farmers and cant be justified on the basis of either science or consumer behaviour, EFA spokesman John Coward said in a statement.The simple fact is that over 50 percent of eggs sold in Aldi stores today are cage eggs, so this decision is a slap in the face for Aldis customers who are being denied their freedom to choose.In disregarding the buying habits of its own customers, and the high standards that its egg suppliers are required to adhere to, Aldi is showing that the facts should never get in the way of responding to ill-informed social media campaigns by a select few.This decision is an insult to consumers, many of whom buy cage eggs because they watch every penny and a potentially devastating blow for Aussie egg farmers who now face financial hardship because a foreign supermarket giant has taken a knee-jerk response to populist social media drivel. ALDI Australian released a statement earlier today. (Facebook) Others have questioned why the retailer needs a decade to fulfil their plan.You need to move much more quickly to win public support. Stop trying to appease us with political statements intended to win votes, one user wrote.I dont understand why it has to take 10 years? Cant you just not order any more caged eggs from tomorrow? another asked.Aldi said the time restriction was down to limited amount of infrastructure to support a cage-free only egg industry.Currently, more than 50 percent of the Australian egg supply is from caged eggs. As a responsible company, Aldi Australia wants to ensure that the complexity of transitioning to cage-free eggs is managed effectively, a spokesperson for the supermarket said.  ninemsn 2016 Buzz Victoria Good News Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

A vet student has come to the rescue of a paralysed dog about to be put down in Portland, Oregon.Ollie, a ten-year-old Shetland Sheepdog, returned home from a camping trick unusually weak and was taken straight to DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital by his frantic owner.Several tests run by the vet were unable to find a reason for Ollies behaviour, who became paralysed and unable to eat as the days wore on. After a gruelling decision to put him down earlier this month, Ollie was saved with only minutes to spare by Neena Golden, a visiting vet student who gave him a comforting scratch behind his ears and found the tick.Dr Adam Stone of DoveLewis diagnosed Ollie with the rare condition of tick paralysis which occurs when the ticks saliva gets into the dogs system - a condition hed learnt about in vet school. Vet student Neena Golden (left) found the tick that led to the diagnosis of tick paralysis. (DoveLewis) The tick was very bloated, and there was lots of faecal material from the tick. It had obviously been there for a while, Dr Stone wrote on the hospital blog.Ms Golden said the eventual diagnosis was a relief among staff.We all high-fived and hugged each other, Ms Golden told ABC News.Ollies owner, Al, told the news station the recovery was a testament to the work of the hospital.He was one minute away from euthanasia, the doctor walked in and remembered that hed heard about this in school, he said.He told me it was just one little thing, one slide, and they mentioned it and that it was rare, and that was it.Ollie was the first case of tick paralysis in the doctors career. He has since made a miraculous recovery.Hes bright-eyed, active [and] has a spring in his step that he hasnt had in quite a while, Al said.Have a good news story youd like to share?

[ WHOLE ARTICLE ]
A Utah woman has taken to Facebook to describe how a stranger leapt into white water to rescue her elderly dog after she was washed downstream.In the post, Sara Melnicoff described how her 13-year-old senile and arthritic dog was swept away after falling into Mill Creek in Moab earlier this month, only to be saved by a Good Samaritan.The post, which includes a photo of a tattooed, muscle-clad man carrying a dog out of a waterway, has since received thousands of reactions and shares. I saw her rush by, unable to do more than keep her head above water. I was running along the creek, calling her name, Ms Melnicoff wrote.I was going to take my shoes off and go in the water to try to get her, when this young man appeared out of nowhere and stripped down to his boxers.He plunged into the water, making his way along the slippery rocks, while the powerful currents of the water rushed all around him.Ms Melnicoff said the man eventually managed to recover the dog, who by this point was shaking like a leaf and didn't have much energy left.Ms Melnicoff recounted feeling very shaken and teary when the man returned with the dog, embracing him in gratitude.When she asked the anonymous rescuer what his favourite charity was so Ms Melnicoff could offer a donation in the mans name, it was revealed that the man in fact ran a not-for-profit of his own, Big Hearts, Big Hands.The charity is dedicated to raising money for mountain rescue organisations, and supporting mountain safety education as well as offering funding to those who have been rescued and their families.Ms Melnicoff has encouraged readers moved by her story to consider making donations of their own.Have a good news story youd like to share?

A popular Nigerian doll line that depicts women with a range skin tones, hairstyles and vibrant African clothing is set to appear in the United States as part of a national tour.The Queens of Africa dolls will be exhibited at Atlanta, New York and Chicago across May and July, during which their creator  Nigerian entrepreneur Taofick Okoya  will be looking to meet with possible American distributors.Mr Okoya hopes to secure a commercial presence stateside for his pint-sized Queens, credited with outselling Mattel toy products in Nigeria back in 2014. The Queens arrival comes in a time of growing diversity in the doll market, with Mattel announcing back in January it would be launching a new line of Barbie dolls featuring a range of body types and skin tones.Mr Okoya said he was inspired to start the Queens of Africa doll line in 2007 after his daughter told him she wanted to be Caucasian.I realised she was going through an identity crisis, he told Forbes.She wished she was white, and I was trying to figure out where that came from.I used to always buy her white dolls, and it never got to me that is was relevant which colour her dolls were.Mr Okoyo hopes the dolls will help empower the African girl child and improve their self-esteem.He also hopes his enterprise  which sees the dolls assembled and their hair braided in Nigeria  will continue to provide employment opportunities for local communities.Mr Okoyo said that even in Nigeria, the Queens line continues to face some obstacles."Theres still somewhat of a colonial brainwash present in the country, he said.Store owners would tell me Oh no, black dolls dont sell, give us more white dolls when I first presented them with the dolls.Theres somewhat of a bandwagon mentality here, where people simply follow trends without asking themselves why.So taking a chance with a black doll was quite difficult for them at first.Have a good news story youd like to share?

Members of a Sydney-based no-kill pet rescue service have pooled their resources to help a crippled dog receive life-changing surgery.Eight-month-old Neopolitan Mastiff cross Zali was handed into Hawkesbury Pound in April with an injured back leg that was mostly skin and bone.She was in pain, she was extremely scared, No Kill Pet Rescue vice president Rita Smith told 9news.com.au, describing her first glimpse of the dog. The first two weeks she spent in the back of the kennel, not really engaging with staff or any of the people coming to the pound looking to adopt. Zali exhibits the "sad faced" look which is usual for her breed. (No Kill Pet Rescue) A No Kill foster carer agreed to take Zali into temporary care, and although Ms Smith said she saw a remarkable improvement in the dogs condition, Zalis back leg remained largely non-operational.When she was running, she would just kind of throw her leg. Kind of like a peg-leg, Ms Smith said.A visit to Small Animal Specialist Hospital (SASH) revealed Zali dog had a torn ligament. The operation to repair it was expected to cost a staggering $5000. Zali has since undergone surgery to repair her damaged ligament. (No Kill Pet Rescue) No Kills board of volunteers met to discuss the possibility of putting aside donor funds to help the poor pooch.We discussed the prospects of Zali after the operation, and we felt that it would significantly improve her chances of being rehomed, but also her quality of life, Ms Smith said.So we decided to spend the money. The transformation from what she was like in the pound kennel to what she is now is just remarkable. Shes now happy, outgoing and full of life." (No Kill Pet Rescue) Zali has since had her severed tendon reattached and is now recovering at her foster carers. It is hoped she will regain full use of her injured leg.For Ms Smith, however, Zalis journey is far from over.Wed love to see her rehomed in a loving, caring family,  Ms Smith said. (No Kill Pet Rescue) (No Kill Pet Rescue) The transformation from what she was like in the pound kennel to what she is now is just remarkable. Shes now happy, outgoing and full of life.Its dogs like Zali who spur us on to continue rescuing and ensuring they get that second chance of life they so deserve.Readers interested in adopting Zali or other No Kill Pet Rescue animals can find more information on the website or on the official Facebook page.Have a good news story youd like to share?
