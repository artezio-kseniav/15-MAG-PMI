The research on the 125-by-90-metre playing-card-shaped fort is the first of its kind and\u00a0has\u00a0been published\u00a0by Mola\u00a0as a 263-page book \u2013 \n\u201cThe research on the fort is hugely significant for how we understand the early development and growth of London \u2013 and how, why and when it first became Britain\u2019s capital,\u201d said Julian Hill, a senior archaeologist at Mola.\nWhat's more, quite separate work by British and other scholars now hints at the possibility that, at the same time or shortly after the fort was built, a huge temple to the Imperial cult may well have been constructed in London. One of the key symbols of Colchester's status as the province's pre-revolt capital had been its Imperial cult temple \u2013 but that building was partly destroyed during the rebellion, and although it was at some stage repaired, some inscriptional evidence from London suggests the possibility that post-revolt Colchester had to share the Imperial cult role with London.\nWith the new fort, archaeologists now believe that\u00a0in the aftermath of the revolt\u00a0the Romans chose London as their new British political headquarters.\nIt had three key strategic, mercantile and political advantages over Colchester. First of all it was the nearest point to the sea that the Thames could easily be bridged. The first London Bridge (just a few metres east of the modern one) \u00a0had been built by the Roman military, probably in 48 AD. Secondly, unlike Colchester, seagoing ships could reach London and unload their freight there. And thirdly, again unlike Colchester which had been a major British tribal capital, London was a totally Roman \"new build\"\u00a0city that therefore had no tribal political baggage or implications to be taken into account.\nIt seems that immediately after the Roman conquest had begun in 43 AD, the then Emperor, Claudius, was keen to impress (and co-opt the status of) Britain's most powerful tribal confederation, the Trinovantes by building his first great Roman fortress there \u2013 and making it the capital of the province. But, in 60 AD, when both Colchester and London were both destroyed in the Boudiccan revolt, the Roman authorities appear to have decided that strategic and logistical factors should now determine where their political headquarters and provincial capital should be \u2013 and London was then developed far more assiduously than Colchester.\nIndeed, within 15 years of the defeat of Boudicca and the upgrading of London, the city experienced huge levels of imperial investment \u2013 including a large forum, a public baths complex, an amphitheatre, major port facilities and other major buildings\u00a0\nSo rapid was the city's growth (and the consequent demand for residential and commercial real estate), that in about\u00a075 AD\u00a0the Roman authorities appear to have decided to relocate London's fort. Certainly, by about\u00a0120 AD\u00a0a new fort had been built at the north-western edge of the burgeoning city \u2013 in what is now Cripplegate.\nThe huge military and therefore political importance of London in the post-Boudicca era was not just because of its fort. Archaeologists now think it is likely that most military hardware was channelled into Britain via London. And on the back of that very substantial military transport operation, mainly conducted by private vessels subcontracted by the military, a large-scale civilian mercantile trade rapidly developed.\nArchaeological research is shedding light on the nature and scale of both the military and civil operations.\nAn analysis of finds from the post-Boudiccan fort (which operated from about\u00a061 AD\u00a0to about\u00a075 AD) shows the sort of military hardware the troops there were being supplied with \u2013 everything from armour, spears and shields to horse fittings, oil lamps and writing equipment. In total, about\u00a060 military items have been identified from the fort so far. However, archaeologists have, over the years, also found large quantities of broken military equipment which the Romans had used as part of landfill to raise ground levels on marshy land 400 metres west of the fort. So far, these include well over 500 fragments of Roman helmet, armour, weaponry and cavalry equipment \u2013 all potentially from the post-Boudiccan fort. It is the largest corpus of Roman military equipment ever found in Britain.\nThere is even some evidence \u2013 Celtic-style metalwork \u2013 from the fort area and the landfill, suggesting that native British auxiliary troops from friendly tribes may have formed part of the post-Boudiccan London garrison\nThe newly re-examined evidence suggesting the possibility that London became a centre for the Imperial cult soon after the Boudiccan revolt is also potentially very significant. It consists of an inscription and two pieces of sculpture. Two items of sculpture (a marble head and a bronze arm) are from imperial statues, probably of the Emperor Nero \u2013 and almost certainly date from the 60s AD.\nBut it is the inscription which is the strongest indicator that London had a large Imperial cult temple. The inscription, in honour of the divine spirit of the emperor, was on a statue plinth which appears originally to have been about\u00a02 metres wide and 1.4 metres high. The unusually large size of this probable plinth strongly suggests that it supported a bronze statue of truly monumental proportions \u2013 potentially double life-size.\nUnderlining the political significance of this once-great statue is a part of the inscription which suggests that it was erected by Roman Britain's provincial council \u2013 the province's rubber-stamp \"parliament\"\u00a0which was responsible for administering the Imperial cult. Strangely, the inscription and the remains of the plinth it was inscribed on, have always been largely ignored by the archaeological world \u2013 mainly because the object was found in 1850, but unfortunately lost by 1859. Only a drawing has survived. However, it is known that it was re-used in a later wall, located only about\u00a0150 metres from a particularly large probable riverside temple built in about\u00a075 AD. In terms of wording, the style of the inscription is, in some respects, unparalleled \u2013 arguably because of its probable early (potentially 1st century) date. One particular possible rendering of the wording of the inscription would have been especially appropriate for the specific political circumstances of the 70s AD. It is also known from Roman classical sources that during the period 69-81 AD\u00a0a particularly large number of imperial statues were erected in Britain."], "news/media/advertising": ["An advert for so-called \u201cdesigner vagina\u201d surgery has been banned for being irresponsible over concerns it could encourage women to be dissatisfied with their bodies.\nThe ad for labia reshaping at the London Bridge Plastic Surgery clinic, carried in the \nFive readers complained that the ad was socially irresponsible for encouraging women to be dissatisfied with their bodies and to undertake unnecessary cosmetic surgery.\nLondon Bridge Plastic Surgery said 100 per cent\u00a0of women undergoing labiaplasty were looking for a more 'natural' appearance, 91 per cent\u00a0reported discomfort from clothing, 69 per cent\u00a0reported discomfort when doing sports and a significant number reported discomfort during intercourse.\nThe clinic said it therefore did not believe it was socially irresponsible to advertise the availability of such surgery, and the women undergoing the procedure did not consider it to be unnecessary.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the description of labiaplasty as achieving \u201ca more natural appearance\u201d implied that the pre-surgery labia might be somehow \u201cunnatural\u201d in appearance.\nIt said: \u201cWe considered that it was irresponsible to imply that any part of a person's body was not natural in appearance, including because it could encourage them to be dissatisfied with their body, regardless of whether or not it encouraged them to undertake cosmetic surgery.\u201d\nIt said that some women might suffer from labial discomfort and seek a labiaplasty, but it was not the case that having larger labia was abnormal or would inevitably cause discomfort, adding: \u201cWe considered that the claim risked encouraging women to view their labia as abnormal, particularly in combination with the reference to 'a more natural appearance'.\n\u201dWe therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible.\u201c\nIt ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form, adding: \u201dWe told (the clinic) to take care when advertising labiaplasty to ensure that they did not encourage women to be dissatisfied with their bodies.\u201c"], "arts-entertainment/books/news": ["Despite his efforts, the novel failed to reach bookstores before the sixth season of \nThankfully,\u00a0the author posted a new sample chapter from the book onto his blog, following Arianne Martell and her dealings with the Sand Snakes. \nUnfortunately for show watchers wanting to get ahead, Arianne has yet to feature in \nWhile optimists may be inclined to think this is a sign Martin is nearing completion of the book, in a separate blog post, the \nSeason six of ", "Young female readers of the \nEL James has sold more than 100 million copies of her raunchy novels about the BDSM relationship between playboy billionaire Christian Grey and his submissive, student Anastasia Steele, but acadamics have revaled that women who read them display higher levels of \u201cambivalent, benevolent and hostile sexism\u201d.\nThe research team at the Ohio State and Michigan State Universities define benevolent sexism as the belief that women are meant to be protected and cared for by men and hostile sexism as objectification.

The only way McGregor could fight is if a) the UFC decides to waive this or b) if McGregor had this clause removed. The likelihood of either scenario is infinitesimally small.\"\nThomas then went on to use the example of why Anderson Silva could not fight Roy Jones Jnr in a boxing match - the UFC simply did not want it to happen and thus it did not because of this very clause.\u00a0\nSpeaking on Wednesday, White made the situation very clear when he told the Dan Patrick Show.\n\"Conor McGregor is under contract with the UFC,\" he said.\u00a0\"Listen, if Floyd wants to fight Conor, call me Floyd.\"\nEvidently, if a fight was to happen between the two of them it would have to go through UFC and then find a way to co-promote with Mayweather Promotions, which also has exclusive partnership rights with Showtime.\nIf contract law isn't enough for you, how about the fact that any sort of fight between the two of them would be a total utter mismatch?\nIf it's a boxing match, Mayweather demolishes him. If it's an MMA fight, McGregor beats Mayweather handily. Let's not forget, we've seen a boxer step into the world of MMA before with James Toney and it was a one-sided beatdown dished out by Randy Cotoure.\nOf course, the question will be asked - why, if it's impossible did Team Mayweather say it 'could' or 'might' happen? That's a very simple question to answer but a wider perspective of events is required to understand why.\nLast weekend, Saul Alvarez took on Amir Khan in Las Vegas, the fight capital of the world, in what was undoubtedly one of the biggest boxing fights of the year so far. The fight was being promoted by Golden Boy Promotions, run by boxing legend Oscar de la Hoya \u2013 previously one of Mayweather's biggest rivals in the ring and now, one of his biggest in the world of promotion.\u00a0\nThe leaking of these comments from the Mayweather camp came at a time when the Alvarez vs Khan promotion should've been at fever pitch, but of course, it was Mayweather vs McGregor that was actually making the headlines. Convenient? Just a little, don't you think?\nThe genius of the situation was that Mayweather himself knew that McGregor would happily get involved with the games given his current status with the UFC.\nMcGregor has been left off the UFC 200 card over a dispute over promotional obligations and is yet to really patch things up with the company\u2019s president Dana White.\nWhile the two look to be getting back on the right track and will meet for dinner next week, McGregor and the UFC were still very much not seeing eye-to-eye. The timing of the talk coming out from the Mayweather camp couldn't have been better in that sense.\u00a0\nThere are another million reasons why this fight could not happen but the above should be enough to convince anyone it will not. You should never say things are impossible, but a fight between McGregor and Mayweather is about as close as it gets.", "Dana White is open to the idea of Floyd Mayweather Jr. taking on Conor McGregor and has invited the retired boxer to contact him, provided that fight takes place in the UFC.\nA bout between Mayweather and McGregor has been mooted last week, when\u00a0\nBoth fighters have since expressed an interest in the proposal, with Mayweather admitting it is \u2018possible\u2019 and McGregor posted a mock-up fight poster on Twitter.\nThe speculation, however, has been widely rejected by others within the mixed martial arts community and even White, the UFC\u2019s president, dismissed the \u2018tabloid\u2019 story last week.\nWhite has now said that he would consider permitting the match-up if it were fought under his promotion company\u2019s banner and has asked Mayweather to call him.\n\"[McGregor] is under contract with the UFC,\u201d he told the \nMcGregor\u2019s UFC contract contains an exclusivity clause which prevents him from competing in the events of other promotion companies, essentially ruling him out of any prospective boxing contest against Mayweather.\nThe Crumlin-bred featherweight nevertheless entertained the idea recently, but insisted that he would only agree to the fight if it was right for him.\n\u201cI'm open to discussions; come at me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hold the key, and it's me who holds the key to the fight game.\n\u201cI am open-minded. I am open to discussion. I love competition. I love fighting. It would be nice to make that fight if the fans were interested and wanted to see it.\"\nLegendary boxing trainer Freddie Roach revealed on Wednesday that McGregor had requested coaching from him, telling BoxingScene.com:\u00a0\"They did ask me if I'll train him. I said 'sure, bring him down.'\n\"I'd like to see [him], meet the guy and see what he has. He seems like a nice guy.\"", "The Brazilian fans are in for a real treat this weekend, with some of the country's biggest stars on the line up for UFC 198. And with a fight card like this, the only way to do it justice is to hold the event in a stadium filled with an audience 45,000 strong. The tickets were sold out in a matter of minutes and local prospects and veterans alike were all vying for an opportunity to showcase their combative capabilities to their country men and women.\nThe history books are filled with Brazilian legends from years gone by. Pioneers of modern MMA, laying the foundations for what the sport is today. Still a powerhouse of combat sports, the top ten of every weight class features stand-out Brazilian athletes, still chasing that UFC gold. In the co-main event we have two highly ranked middleweights squaring off, in a bout that is sure to divide the fan support in attendance.\nOne of Brazil's most recognisable and longest-serving UFC fighters, Vitor Belfort, steps in once again to begin what he considers his last run at the title. The young, hungry prospect looking to earn his shot by beating Belfort, is Ronaldo 'Jacare' Souza. Considered as one of the best Jiu Jitsu representatives to ever fight in the Octagon (one of three that are on this card), Jacare has a lot of hype and support in his native country. In what could be a changing of the guard, I know many fans will hope to see the new blood continue to fly the Brazilian flag all the way to the belt.\u00a0\nMany will still be rooting for Belfort though, as most MMA fans, including Souza, grew up watching him fight. It will be a polarising bout but an essential one if we are to find the next contender. Does Vitor get one more chance or will he be shut out by the younger and highly skilled Souza? It has to be said, Belfort hasn't lost his hand speed after twenty years of fighting. If he can't keep it on the feet though, it will be no use, and the quicksand-like grappling of Souza could prove too much.\u00a0\nOnce the drama of the co-main event is over, the crowd can unite again behind their heavyweight champion, Fabricio Werdum, as he takes on a very physical and well-rounded challenger in Stipe Miocic. As I mentioned, the three most decorated Jiu Jitsu practitioners in the sport are on this card, and Werdum is one of them. His submission of Fedor Emelianenko in Strikeforce in 2010 will forever be remembered as a big shock to the MMA world. From then he has gone from strength to strength. Studying under Muay Thai master Rafael Cordeiro, the champion\u2019s striking is starting to look at formidable as his submission attack.\nHis relaxed style serves him well in the longer championship fights and he is just as effective at range as he is in the clinch. From the fluid combinations demonstrated against Travis Browne back in April 2014, to the knockout knee over the granite-chinned Mark Hunt at UFC 180, Werdum has shown why he is the king of the division. However, the man challenging his position is equally as well-rounded, with \u00a0Golden Gloves boxing and Division 1 wrestling experience.\nIn the main event at UFC Fight Night: Miocic vs Hunt, Stipe Miocic dominated Mark Hunt for 23 minutes with heavy wrestling pressure, before getting the late finish with ground and pound. Then, after knocking out Andrei Arlovski in quick time earlier this year, Miocic roared at UFC president Dana White to give him his title shot. Now he is counting down the hours until he gets what he asked for: a chance to stand across the Octagon from the champion.\nHis wrestling experience could definitely cause Werdum some problems, provided Miocic is able to prevent the takedown. Then we will see who has the striking advantage. I would think that Werdum wins in the kicking exchanges, but Stipe would win the boxing range. Then the Thai boxing clinch advantage would likely be with Werdum, although Miocic showed great elbows in the Nelson fight at UFC 161 in 2013. If it advances from that point, I believe that Miocic controls the takedown, but he better have his submission defence on point if he is sitting in the champion\u2019s guard for any length of time.\nAs you can see, it has the makings of a highly competitive fight. Who will come out on top is really dependent on which athlete performs on the night. I wouldn\u2019t be sad either way. The heavyweight division has never been more exciting than it is now and after his impressive win in Rotterdam last weekend, Alistair Overeem is lying in wait for whoever steps out of the Octagon victorious. Don\u2019t miss the rest of this amazing card as well. I would be remiss to leave out Demian Maia, the third man in this trinity of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu assassins that are on the card. He will face \u2018The Immortal\u2019 Matt Brown in what promises to be a barn-burner, to headline the preliminary card."], "environment/nature": ["Female gorillas have been documented engaging in lesbian \nThe behaviour was observed by scientists\u00a0during a research trip to the \nThe wild mountain gorillas, observed by \nWhile many species of male primates are well known to engage in homosexual behaviour, females have been subject to far less attention.

This, in turn, affects your sleep patterns.\nCaffeine is pretty addictive too, so you may need some convincing before you cut back.\nMark Winwood, director of psychological services at AXA PPP healthcare, gives nine good reasons to watch control your intake.\nConsuming caffeine, even six hours before bedtime, has been shown to disrupt sleep. Caffeine affects your sleep stages and cycles, influencing the amount of time spent in lighter sleep stages. It can also act as a trigger to wake you when you would naturally transition between REM (deep sleep) and Stage 1 (light sleep). Caffeine also can influence your circadian rhythm; even one coffee after dinner can delay the production of melatonin by about 40 minutes \u2013 shifting your body clock.\nCaffeine stimulates the central nervous system - within just 15 minutes of you finishing that cup - and the effects can last for hours.\nCaffeine increases your stress hormones (catecholamines.) Stress kicks off a chain reaction - releasing cortisol and increasing insulin - which can cause inflammation. So instead of the boost you were hoping for, you can end up feeling rotten.\nCoffee can contribute to acid reflux and heartburn, as well as irritating the gallbladder and colon, which may cause stomach pain and irregular bowel movements.\nCutting back on caffeine is an important way to reduce incontinence. Coffee irritates the bladder and can even make existing incontinence issues worse.\nQuality sleep and less stress are a potent combination if you\u2019re trying to start a family, so this small lifestyle change could help towards this.\nDrinking too much coffee during pregnancy has been linked to low birth weight, so drinking less is recommended.\nSome caffeinated drinks like coffee and fizzy drink are known dental disasters \u2013 whether for sugar content or for staining your teeth. Drink more water and you\u2019ll have more to smile about.\nCaffeine can mask the depressant effects of alcohol and research suggests that drinkers who consume alcohol mixed with energy drinks are three times more likely to binge drink.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Directory of Hospital includes details of the hospitals that Personal Health members can use.

By the time he left the role, the Aussies weren\u2019t so much in a state of flux as falling apart at the seams.\nRiven by internal rivalries, Arthur was pilloried for his decision to send home Shane Watson, Mitchell Johnson, James Pattinson and Usman Khawaja for a breach of discipline on their disastrous pre-Ashes trip to India.\nThat breach involved the failure to come back to Arthur with three clear points detailing how individual and team performances could improve following a three and a half day humbling at the hands of the hosts in Hyderabad.\nIt\u2019s a judgement that has hung heavily over Arthur in the intervening three and a half years and, ultimately, played a part in his humiliating sacking on the eve of the Ashes.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, when you go on to Google everything is about the way you were sacked when you were in charge of Australia,\u201d says Arthur. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mention the good things I did with South Africa or the good things I did in my first year with Australia when I brought in a lot of young players and gave them opportunities and tried to build a team.\n\u201cThat all tends to get lost in the fact that you ultimately got sacked and that\u2019s disappointing. It does give me a motivation to re-establish myself. I know I\u2019m a really good coach and now I\u2019ve got the chance to try and re-establish myself.\u201d\nHis first assignment couldn\u2019t be more testing. England have proved formidable on home soil in recent years and comfortably saw off Australia\u2019s challenge last year. Trevor Bayliss\u2019s side also beat South Africa away from home this winter with a side bursting with youthful zest and vigour.\nThat compares starkly with a Pakistan side still heavily reliant on captain Misbah Ul-Haq and Younis Khan. The latter is 38, while the evergreen Ul-Haq will turn 42 before the series begins.\nThat said, the pair played a key role in Pakistan\u2019s 2-0 series win against Alastair Cook\u2019s side in the UAE, with both averaging over 50. Playing on unfamiliar English pitches, of course, will offer a different test entirely.\nIt will also offer Arthur the chance to renew acquaintances with his good friend, Trevor Bayliss, who has had such an extraordinary impact on this England side since taking over from Peter Moores 12 months ago. \u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to start,\u201d says Arthur. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back to England and hopefully finish a series there this time.\n\u201cI know Trevor well. Trevor has been round the block with Sri Lanka and others and he knows what it\u2019s all about, he understands what\u2019s needed to be successful. He has brought fresh ideas to a different country and that\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to bring to Pakistan.\u201d\nLike the age difference between the two sides, the pressure facing Arthur will be in sharp contrast to the relatively serene life he has enjoyed since being relieved of his post with Australia.\nShoaib Akhtar is just one high profile former Pakistan player to set the clock ticking on Arthur\u2019s time to turn around the faltering fortunes of a country that\u2019s still unable to play matches on home soil as a result of security fears. \u00a0Working as a coach in a private school, while running his own coaching academy, therefore, hardly seems like the ideal preparation for most onerous of tasks.\n\u00a0\nArthur, though, insists that his relatively stress-free existence \u2013 punctuated by coaching stints in the Pakistan, Bangladesh and West Indies T20 Premier Leagues \u2013 has merely fuelled his desire to get back into the international game.\n\u201cI got to a point in my life where I loved what I was doing but I felt I still had more,\u201d he says. \u201cI still wanted that adrenaline rush on matchday, I still wanted to test myself at the highest level.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a great time coaching teams in these various T20 tournaments but that involvement obviously only lasts for a finite period. I just felt I was too young to be doing what I was doing. That was a job for me in four or five years\u2019 time. I\u2019m going to give international cricket one more crack. The Pakistan job seems like a perfect fit.\u201d\nEngland should be wary too, given Arthur\u2019s excellent record against them during his tenure with South Africa. He led his home country to their first series win in England in over 40 years in 2008 \u2013 a victory which played a key role in South Africa being crowned the number one side in world cricket under his stewardship.\nHis record of 10 wins in 19 Tests with Australia also suggests that his failures with the England\u2019s greatest rivals was based more on perception than fact.\nArthur has already said that he will be tough on discipline with his new charges, a warning that any homework-shy Pakistan international will do well to heed.\nEngland, meanwhile, will hope that the second half of this Test match summer will provide the tourists and their coach with the sharpest learning curve possible.\u00a0", "Charlotte Edwards, England's long-serving and highly-successful women's cricket captain, has announced her retirement.\nEdwards, 36, has called time on a 20-year international career - during which she has led her country to victory in the Ashes, World Cup and ICC World Twenty20.\nShe also made more than 10,000 runs across the formats at the top of the order for her country, and won a record 309 caps.\nEdwards, who led England in 220 matches, explained her decision to retire with immediate effect and has reflected on a captaincy career which included three Ashes successes and a World Cup and World Twenty20 double in 2009.\n\"Everyone who knows me - and how much I love playing for England - will appreciate what a difficult decision it has been for me to retire from international cricket,\" she said.\n\"It's a decision I've reached after much thought and detailed discussion with [England coach] Mark Robinson and [director of England women's cricket] Clare Connor about what is best for the team going forward.\n\"I have given 20 years to playing for England and I leave very proud of the standing in which the women's game is held and of my contribution as a player and captain.\"\nEdwards has lived her dream, in an era of sustained achievement for her team.\nShe added: \"As a 16-year-old girl making my debut for England, I couldn't have dreamt that I would have had such an amazing time with so much success.\n\"I've travelled the world, won World Cups and Ashes series and shared it all with some of my closest friends.\n\"However, nothing lasts forever.\"\nEdwards has mixed feelings about the end of her career, but has agreed to call time and allow Robinson to mould a new team. The England and Wales Cricket Board will announce her successor in due course.\n\"I believe now is the right time for a new captain to lead the team forward and for young players to be given more opportunities to make their mark on the international game,\" she said.\n\"After honest and open discussions with Mark, it became clear that he wants to build a new team - and I fully support that.\n\"I would have loved to have carried on - and while I am disappointed that I won't be doing so, I fully understand and respect what Mark is looking to do.\n\"This is a new era and he wants other players to come to the fore to build a strong team.\n\"Aside from the team's successes and my own personal record, I am most proud of where the women's game is now.\"\nEdwards has made more international appearances than any other female cricketer, and has made more Twenty20 runs for her country than any other man or woman worldwide.\nHer Ashes victories as captain came in 2008 and 2014 in Australia, and 2013 in England. In 2008, she was the International Cricket Council's women's player of the year and - following those back-to-back Ashes successes - in 2014 was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year and awarded a CBE.\nECB chief executive Tom Harrison paid her a rich tribute.\n\"Charlotte Edwards has been at the heart of the England women's team and a major force in international women's cricket for two decades,\" he said.\n\"Her outstanding achievements in the game during that time are unrivalled, and in many aspects, are unlikely to ever be surpassed.\n\"She leaves the most wonderful legacy, having inspired countless women and girls around the world to pick up a bat and a ball and play the game she so clearly loves.\n\"On behalf of the ECB and everyone involved in England cricket, I would like to thank Charlotte for her very special contribution to the game.\"\nConnor added: \"In a staggering career spanning 20 years, she has achieved it all. She has witnessed great change: from making her debut in 1996 when, aged 16, she paid \u00a350 for the privilege of her first England blazer to turning fully professional for these twilight years of her career.\n\"Unlike her sport and her journey through it, Charlotte the person has barely changed.\n\"Despite the CBE, the professional contract, the media requests and the World Cup medals, she has remained constant, true to herself, an impeccable role model for our sport and, indeed, for all women in sport.\"\nEdwards will continue to play domestic cricket as captain of Kent and the Southern Vipers, in this summer's inaugural Kia Super League.", "Stuart Broad sees similarities in himself with Jake Ball but won\u2019t be rushing to give the newcomer any advice for fear of meddling and muddling the paceman who he thinks is in fine fettle as it is. The bowler has been called up to the England squad ahead of next week\u2019s first Investec Test against Sri Lanka and his Nottinghamshire team-mate has been impressed.\n\u201cJake is a relatively similar bowler to myself in height and what he looks to do with the ball,\u201d Broad says. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends and I\u2019ll be able to talk it through with him. But, to be honest, the way he\u2019s bowling at the minute, he\u2019s the sort of guy you just let go. Whatever he's been doing in the last 18 months, but particularly the last six, seven weeks, is exactly what\u2019s got him into the Test-match squad so that\u2019s what he should do if he gets a chance to play.\u00a0\nThe time for Broad\u2019s pearls of wisdom can wait. \u201cDiscussions come and learning comes when, say, he goes to India where he\u2019s never been or plays at a ground he\u2019s never played. That\u2019s when you can learn from others but the way he is at the minute, I wont say too much to him.

He\u2019s tall, he\u2019s got good pace and he can move the ball both away and into the right-hander and he comes round the wicket to the left-handers as well. He takes big wickets [he\u2019s got Joe Root and Kumar Sangakarra this summer in County matches]. He gets top order batsmen out. I know he\u2019s delighted with the call-up and it\u2019s great reward for early county season form.\u201d\nBut how will he handle the pressure of an England call up? Some cricketers take to the international scene like ducks to water others sink under the weight of expectation. \u201cWell, we played the county champions [Yorkshire] last week and he was the best bowler on show,\u201d Broad says. \u201cIt\u2019s always a good sign when players perform on TV against big players. When he found out he said he felt a bit sick - but he then said he didn\u2019t know if that was because he had a bit too much cake at Lord\u2019s!\u201d\nSangakkara, one of Ball\u2019s many victims this season - he leads the First Division wicket-taking chart - also thinks the decision to include the seamer is sensible. \u201cHe\u2019s very impressive,\u201d said the former Sri Lanka and now Surrey batsman. \u201cHe has good movement with the ball. He\u2019s not express quick but he bowls a heavy ball and he bowls in the right areas. If it\u2019s not working he changes very quickly with lines and angles and lengths. When you have bowlers in form you need to pick them at the right time - so England\u2019s made a very wise choice.\u201d\u00a0\nThe other newcomer in the England squad is James Vince of Hampshire who will bat at No 5 as a replacement for James Taylor who has retired due to ill-health. Broad has heard good things and thinks it will add even more firepower to England\u2019s already explosive middle-order. \u201cFrom what I hear he\u2019s got a very good temperament, very relaxed, he knows his game,\u201d Broad says. \u201cHe\u2019s been compared to Michael Vaughan. He looks like he will suit the better pitches of Test cricket than nibbly wickets of country cricket - but saying that he still averages 42 in first-class so he\u2019s obviously got a huge amount of talent.\u00a0\n\u201cI like the way that adds strength to our middle order - he is a bit of a shotmaker - he plays through the off-side extremely well and likes to score. So with the likes of Root, Vince, Stokes and Bairstow, we should see quite an entertaining batting order if the top order set it up.\u201d\nBroad is also pleased that the selectors, true to form, have largely stuck with the squad that was successful in the winter. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting squad,\u201d he says. \u201cI like the fact the selectors have given chances to guys who were involved in the Test series win in South Africa - because that\u2019s not an easy thing to do and these are the guys in possession of the shirts and they deserve another crack.\u201d", "The retirement of England captain Charlotte Edwards from international cricket this week came as something of a shock. It had been widely anticipated that she wouldn\u2019t remain as the side\u2019s skipper but her skill as a player seemed undiminished.\nSure enough, Edwards has indicated that her decision came after England\u2019s coach, Mark Robinson, told her she wouldn\u2019t be considered for forthcoming series against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Indies. He has evidently concluded that Edwards\u2019 presence \u2013 even stripped of the captaincy \u2013 would make it harder for other players to develop their own games, such has been her dominance.\nSome will admire Robinson\u2019s courage in casting aside a player who has been England\u2019s best for two decades. Even at the recent T20 World Cup, where her captaincy was arguably found wanting, Edwards was the team\u2019s top run-scorer. Yet it is precisely her continued ability to churn out big scores which makes this so-called retirement premature.\nEdwards\u2019 excellence was obvious from early on \u2013 she grew up in Huntingdon and was frequently featured in the back pages of my local paper, the Cambridge Evening News (as it was then). She and I were the same age and her name would occasionally come up when chatting to team-mates in various school, club and representative sides I played for. Someone might happen to mention they had played against her \u2013 she regularly appeared in male teams \u2013 and there would be an inevitable volley of teenage boys giggling at the idea of a girl playing cricket. But then there would be a pause and someone would conclude: \u201cShe can really bat though.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\nDuring her England career Edwards has racked up all sorts of records and achievements. She has helped to raise the profile of women\u2019s cricket no end and the future for the game looks bright. But for her international playing days to have ended in this low-profile fashion is desperately unsatisfactory, however the England team gets on without her.\n**************************\nThe announcement of England\u2019s first test squad of the summer is one of the great moments of the season, although central contracts have maybe dimmed the excitement a tad. Still, call-ups for James Vince and Jake Ball were both noteworthy. Personally, I\u2019d have liked to see Tom Westley brought in to bat at three, and I remain unconvinced by Alex Hales as a test player \u2013 another Alex, Yorkshire\u2019s Lees, and Surrey\u2019s all-rounder Zafar Ansari are my long-term bets as England openers.\nVince is assured of a starting spot. Ball will presumably be vying with Steven Finn for the final bowling position (unless England decide to forego Moeen Ali\u2019s spin) and could push his rival hard. Finn has not had a brilliant start to the season and there are mutterings about what his best role in the team really is: should he be the big, aggressive quick, bouncing people out; or should he concentrate on his new-found ability to swing the ball; or does he become England\u2019s Glenn McGrath, bowling with good pace but aiming metronomically for the top of off stump? Stuart Broad faced a similar conundrum a few years ago and came out the other side successfully enough. Finn can do the same; he just needs to decide what kind of bowler he is going to be.\nThe only other question for England is how many marathons Ben Stokes plans to run over five days at Headingley. Smashing sixes may reduce the need for speedy singles when he has a bat in his hand, but does that justify the compensation of such a long run-up when he bowls? Given the one-paced nature of his approach covering so many miles seems unnecessary.\n***************************\nRain may have curtailed most of the recent round of Championship matches, but at least the \u2018no-toss\u2019 trial can\u2019t be blamed for this week\u2019s many draws. Indeed, at Old Trafford we may have glimpsed its intended purpose, as Simon Kerrigan spun out Hampshire on the last day, taking 5-59 from 36 overs. Over in Leeds, Joe Root\u2019s off-spin came in handy too as Yorkshire completed victory against Surrey.\nKerrigan\u2019s single test appearance in the last Ashes test of 2013 was a fairly unmitigated disaster. His leading arm fell away and he appeared to be trying to put the ball on the spot rather than really bowl it. Yet in the Championship he has remained one of Lancashire\u2019s key players. In 2014, when the red rose last bloomed in Division One \u2013 albeit briefly \u2013 he was among the top three spin bowlers behind Jeetan Patel and Adil Rashid. Last season he took more than 40 wickets once again as Lancashire won promotion from Division Two.\nWith Adil Rashid having failed to shine in tests over the winter, Kerrigan has a chance to put his name back in the frame should England want a second spinner at any point this summer. Along with other prospects including Zafar Ansari and Hampshire\u2019s young leg-break purveyor, Mason Crane, Kerrigan will be hoping that the ECB\u2019s attempt to induce more spin-friendly pitches works in his favour.\n*******************************\nThe death of Tony Cozier robs Test Match Special of perhaps its smoothest voice. As a child I \u2013 like many I expect \u2013 heard him commentate and envisaged a face full of wisdom and cricketing job. In my mind he probably looked a little like Clive Lloyd. It turned out I was fairly wide of the mark insofar as the visuals were concerned. But like Lloyd, Cozier will go down as one of the legends of Caribbean cricket.", "Uncapped James Vince and Jake Ball are both named in England's 12-man squad for the first Investec Test against Sri Lanka at Headingley.\nHampshire batsman Vince appears set for a debut next week, in a line-up also including Nick Compton - who has kept his spot as England's likely number three - while Ball will have to vie for the third seamer's role.\nBall, 25, has stated his case with 19 wickets already for Nottinghamshire this summer in the Specsavers County Championship - having spent the winter with England Lions in the UAE and at a fast-bowling camp in South Africa.\nLions captain Vince, also 25, has five limited-overs caps and was part of the England squad which reached the final of the ICC World Twenty20 in India last month.\nHe too has begun the domestic summer well, including hitting a century against Yorkshire at Headingley.\nNational selector James Whitaker, said: \"Both Jake Ball and James Vince thoroughly deserve their opportunity, having performed well with the England Lions and starting the season in good form with their respective counties.\n\"James has been a consistent performer for Hampshire and England Lions over the past few years. He is already well-regarded by the England coaches in the short format and now has the opportunity to showcase his skills at Test level.\n\"Building on his success with the Lions in the winter, Jake has impressed with the ball and has shown excellent control and skill in the opening matches of the county championship.\n\"If selected, we are confident he will perform very well at international level.\"\nThe first Test starts next Thursday, against opponents who pulled off a last-ditch victory over England at the same venue two years ago to take that series 1-0.\nAlex Hales remains as captain Alastair Cook's opening partner, while Steven Finn is fit again and likely to join the attack in Leeds ahead of Ball.\nHales and Compton will begin the series with points to prove, after their unconvincing Test winters.\nEngland's linchpin batsman Joe Root has great faith in them to deliver, though.\n\"I see these guys play a lot, and I know what they're capable of doing,\" he told Sky Sports News.\n\"I've got every confidence in those guys ahead of me to go on and make big scores.\n\"I'm sure they'll want to prove a lot of people wrong that are doubting them.\n\"Every time you go out there, it's an opportunity to do something special for your country.\n\"That's the way I'm sure they'll look at it, and exactly the way I look at it as well.\"Vince's first Test opportunity comes after the enforced retirement of James Taylor, at the age of just 26, because of his serious heart condition.\nThe only other player who was in the team which finished the series victory over South Africa in January but is missing from the 12 named on Thursday morning is seamer Chris Woakes.\nBall is preferred after making a persuasive case at the start of this season, particularly when taking two wickets in two deliveries - including Root for a golden duck - in the televised match at home to Yorkshire.\nVince is determined to enjoy the occasion when he returns to Headingley for his Test debut.\n\"Obviously I wasn't there long ago, and it was nice to spend some time in the middle,\" he said, recalling that hundred against Yorkshire.\n\"But this is going to be a different feeling. I'm really looking forward to it, and I'm going to try and soak it all up and enjoy it.\"\nThe Hampshire captain told his club's website: \"It's something I've been aiming for since I was a little kid really.\n\"Definitely when I was growing up, playing for England in a Test was still the number one.\n\"I've had the experience of the T20s in Dubai against Pakistan, when it was a good feeling being able to contribute to the team. Being in the World T20 squad was a great experience as well, although obviously I would have liked to have played more of a part.\n\"Since then I've turned my attention to Hampshire and trying to have a good start to the season. It's only the last week when I started to notice stuff in the press. But to get the call, it took a while to sink in.\"\nFor Ball, an exciting learning curve lies ahead too.\nHe told his club's website: \"I haven't met (coach) Trevor Bayliss yet, so I'm looking forward to seeing what he's about - and obviously meeting up with a few of the players I haven't played against or met.\n\"It's going to be a really exciting time, and I really can't wait to get going.\"\nEngland have also named a 30-man performance squad for this summer.\nIt includes their 22 players who are either centrally-contracted or have incremental contracts based on international appearances over the past year.", "With his honeyed voice and his gentle air of authority, Tony Cozier, who died this week at the age of 75 following a long illness, was a giant of cricket broadcasting and a journalist whose fearless judgements made him the most trenchant critic of the West Indies team and its governing elite. He made his debut on Test Match Special half a century ago and was ideally placed to chronicle the Windies\u2019 rise to global dominance, their subsequent decline and their recent renaissance.\nHis broadcasting prowess was based on his sound newspaper background. Michael Holding, then still a promising schoolboy player, recalled seeing Cozier for the first time. The fast bowler was at a cocktail party with the Jamaica captain Maurice Foster after a Shell Shield match. \u201cThat\u2019s Tony Cozier,\u201d said Foster, pointing him out. \u201cOne thing I can tell you, if he writes well about you, you have a chance of playing for the West Indies.\u201d\nCozier also wrote for The Independent and its Sunday sibling, and was a perennial delight to deal with, if occasionally elusive, thanks to his broadcasting commitments. He would always eventually ring in to the desk, though, with his trademark, \u201cHello, it\u2019s Tony Cozier, man.\u201d He would be given his word count, sign off with \u201cCheery-bye,\u201d then deliver a piece that was invariably well-crafted and to the point.\nWinston Anthony Lloyd Cozier was born in Barbados in 1940. People often assumed he was black before meeting him for the first time, or seeing a photo of him, but he was the descendant of Scottish labourers who had moved to the island in the 17th century to man the sugar plantations.\nHe was born into a newspaper family \u2013 his father, Jimmy, was managing editor of the St Lucia Voice and founder of the Barbados Daily News, and the only West Indian journalist to cover the historic tour of England in 1950, when the tourists won at Lord\u2019s for the first time. Tony studied journalism at Carleton University in Ottawa, having embarked on a career of cricket writing when he was only 18. Though he never played cricket at the top level, he was an opening batsman and wicketkeeper for the Bajan clubs, Wanderers and Carlton, and he also kept goal for the island\u2019s hockey team.\nHe made his radio Test debut in 1965, covering Australia\u2019s visit to the West Indies, the hosts\u2019 first series win over the visitors. The following year he began his decades-long stint on Test Match Special, and he would also work for Channel 9 in Australia for 14 years, as well as Sky Sports. His ball-by-ball commentaries were a thing of consummate beauty, on radio or TV, and put him alongside John Arlott, Richie Benaud and Brian Johnston in the pantheon of cricket broadcasting. \u201cAs a summariser to his radio commentary,\u201d remarked Mike Selvey, \u201cas I frequently had been both at home and in the Caribbean, you fed him, sat back and enjoyed the exhilarating ride.\u201d\nAs West Indies began to bestride the cricketing world, Cozier was in the commentary box, often accompanied by Everton Weekes. He was also cricket correspondent of the Barbados Advocate, and played a prominent role in setting up The Nation newspaper, which took a more fearless approach to reporting the game.\nWhile West Indies reigned supreme, all was well between Cozier and the authorities, but as the team slid into humiliating decline he was unforgiving, of players he felt weren\u2019t pulling their weight and of the ruling bodies who seemed powerless to halt the slide into mediocrity.\nIn 2007 he gave the third Frank Worrell Lecture at London Metropolitan University, and was frank about the stark future facing Windies cricket if matters were not urgently addressed: \u201cThere will come a time when the West Indies will find themselves engaged in the ICC\u2019s world league,\u201d he said, \u201cstruggling to avoid a loss to Vietnam in some tournament in Outer Mongolia.\u201d\nPart of the problem, he believed, was that the game was not uppermost in the minds of the region\u2019s young people. Previous generations of cricketers, he said, had \u201cneeded no reminding of the significance of their performances to the psyche of West Indians everywhere, not least the hundreds of thousands who made their home and eked out a living in England.\u201d The thrills-and-spills new Twenty20 format proved to be West Indies\u2019 saviour, and Cozier lived long enough to see the side regain something of their former status.\nHe wrote the definitive The West Indies: 50 Years of Test Cricket, edited The West Indies Cricket Annual for all its 22 editions and the Wisden History of the World Cup, as well as working with Clive Lloyd and Holding on their autobiographies. The press box at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown was named after him, and in 2011 he was given honorary life membership of the MCC.\n\u201cHe knew everything about the game,\u201d Holding told ESPN Cricinfo, for whom Cozier penned a series of acutely observed pieces in latter years, often biting, never afraid to upset officialdom. \u201cNot just the tactics of the game, but statistics of the game. On so many occasions I remember calling Tony from different parts of the world. People arguing about a fact on cricket, at any hour, in some bar or some place, and they\u2019d say immediately, \u2018I\u2019m going to call Tony.\u2019\u201d\nThough he had not broadcast for some time \u2013 squeezed out, it was said, by vindictive authorities who resented his criticisms, and by the obsession with having only former top-level players behind the microphone \u2013 his reputation endured. Last year the former England captain, Michael Vaughan, reported back from a dinner being held during the second Test of West Indies\u2019 tour to England. The Windies batsman Marlon Samuels was there, and Vaughan said, \u201cHe walked past me, Swanny [the England bowler Graeme Swann] and the TMS team, up to Tony Cozier, said \u2018Ledge\u2019, shook his hand and walked off.\u201d\nCharming and courteous, Cozier was loved as much by those who worked with him as by those who listened to him or were commentated on by him. Many a fortunate hack was entertained at his beach house at the idyllic Consett Bay on the east coast of Barbados, with beer and a barbecue followed by a game of beach cricket.\nAnd his love of the good life went with him wherever he travelled. In 2009, David Gower wrote, \u201cI am feeling a bit green this morning. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing to do with too many margaritas with Tony Cozier, just jealousy at the way Andrew Strauss keeps pumping out hundreds.\u201d\nCozier\u2019s son Craig also became a top-level hockey player and cricket journalist and broadcaster. He had recently flown home from India, where he works a television producer in the Indian Premier League, to be by his father\u2019s bedside at the Bayview Hospital in Bridgetown. When Tony\u2019s death was announced, the West Indies captain Darren Sammy said, \u201cThat voice will forever be in my head.\u201d The same goes for legions of cricket lovers the world over.", "Hanif Mohamed\u2019s epic match-saving 337 against the West Indies in 1958, spanning three days play and lasting 16 hours and 10 minutes, is currently cricket\u2019s longest innings \u2013 however that looks like a mere knock about in the garden when compared with the feats completed today by Eric Dusingizimana.\u00a0\nIn an unbelievable display of endurance, the Rwandan international cricket captain batted for 51 hours straight to claim the Guinness World Record for the longest individual net session, beating a time of just over 50 hours set by Virag Mare in India last year.\nDusingizimana, who was bowled to by Tony Blair, Miss Rwanda and many, many more during the course of his epic net session, was raising money for the Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation \u2013 a charity set up to raise money and build the first dedicated international cricket ground in Rwanda.\nHis gargantuan stint at the crease began on the 11th May and finished earlier today and in total he batted for approximately five and a half hours longer than the entire Australian cricket team managed in the whole of the 2015 Ashes series.\nSpeaking after his efforts, Dusingizimana said: \u201cI am so happy to have helped raise awareness for cricket in Rwanda and the work of the Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation (RCSF). We need to build the future of cricket in Rwanda, which is why the stadium is important. But we want also want to use the new facilities to help the sport unite our country and raise awareness about the importance of health and education.\u201d\nThe charity, whose patrons include the Prime Minister David Cameron, West Indies legend Brian Lara and Test Match Special doyen Jonathan Agnew, is in fact no stranger to world records.\nRCSF Project Director Alby Shale himself briefly held the world record for the longest net back in 2013, with a 26 hour batting session and in 2014 the charity was also involved in the highest-ever cricket match, 5730m up, at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.\nShale said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe the record is now nearly double what it was three years ago. Well done to Eric, it was a privilege to be a part of his wonderful achievement.\u201d\nTony Blair, who was in Rwanda for the World Economic Forum on Africa, and bowled off a frugal two-pace run up, was similarly effusive in his praise.\n\u201cThe last time I bowled was most likely at school, so it was great to have a bowl against Eric,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he did is an incredible feat: batting for 51 hours non-stop and breaking the world record, and, in doing so, helping raise money for Rwanda\u2019s first cricket stadium. So I offer my congratulations and wish him and the RCSF all the best as they look to build a better future for cricket in the country.\u201d\u00a0", "", "Cruyff had his turn, Fosbury had his flop and Finn has his law.\u00a0\nIt is a rare and special sportsman indeed who can add their name to their sport\u2019s lexicon but Steven Finn has that honour. And it was at Headingley, the venue for this week\u2019s first Test between England and Sri Lanka, that it all began.\u00a0\nBack in 2012 Finn dislodged the bails at the bowler\u2019s end with his knee on several occasions - most damagingly during a delivery that would have dismissed the South African captain, Graeme Smith, who was in single figures. It caused the game\u2019s law makers to introduce what is now commonly known as Finn\u2019s Law: a no-ball if there is a clatter at the wrong end.\u00a0\n\u201cHeadingley is where my kneeing the stumps started so it\u2019ll bring back memories of that,\u201d a tanned and relaxed Finn says at the Investec series launch in London. \u201cThat\u2019s been and gone but Headingley is a funny ground because of the slope. You don't get too many slopes directly down the wicket. There, Hove and Derby are the only three grounds in the country. So it\u2019s a little bit different. You have to run in harder up the hill, to pump your legs to get there with rhythm and you can almost cruise down the hill - but if you cruise too much it can throw your rhythm out.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a rhythm at Leeds but once you do you can play it to your advantage because you can fly in down the hill and you do tend to get a bit more bounce up the hill. So it\u2019ll be about adjusting to that in the practice sessions before the Test. Getting used to both those ends and taking that practice into the game.\u201d\nFinn\u2019s knocking knees were a problem during a time when he was yo-yoing in and out of the team and looked nervous on the big stage. Ashley Giles, then England\u2019s limited-overs coach, infamously and somewhat cruelly described him as \u201cunselectable\u201d in 2014. Now, he looks at ease in the Test side having been a key factor in England\u2019s resurgence under Trevor Bayliss over the last 12 months.\nFinn played the final three Test of last summer\u2019s Ashes, took 12 wickets at 22, and the first three of the tour of South Africa over the winter, taking 11 wickets at 26. Injuries, as ever with Finn, have stopped him playing the lot. But, he\u2019s back at it, enjoying the summer so far and is excited about the first Test.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about myself over the last couple of years,\u201d he says. \u201cI know my action well enough to be able to have periods away from cricket and then come back to it and be bowling well again. You don't want injuries, you want to keep bowling to keep that rhythm, especially when you\u2019re in good form. But I don\u2019t think the injuries will have set me back too much. I\u2019m more in tune with my game and what I\u2019m trying to do to get people out. I feel in a good place, most definitely.\u201d\nHe\u2019ll hope that place is out in the middle. Jake Ball has burst on to the international scene this summer with his first Test squad call up and is challenging the Middlesex man. \u201cI went a bit of a way towards cementing that third seamer spot in the winter in South Africa,\u201d Finn says. \u201cCompetition puts English cricket in a healthy place. Unless you are a Stuart Broad or a James Anderson you are never settled in that line up.\u00a0\n\u201cSo it\u2019s about trying to get yourself to the same level that they have and they\u2019ve only done that through hard work and taking wickets consistently for England. That\u2019s when you make that spot your own. It\u2019s a big summer for me to try and cement that spot in the team. But I'm not putting too much pressure on myself. If you put pressure on, it won\u2019t come. I just want to relax, play with a smile on my face and let the ball do the talking.\u201d\nThe ball has done some talking for Finn so far this summer but occasionally the only noise it\u2019s made is when it\u2019s hit the middle of the bat. \u201cI\u2019ve bowled some good spells this summer so far,\u201d Finn says, \u201cand I\u2019ve bowled some not great spells. It\u2019s like it has been my whole career: a few too many four balls when you're a little bit out of rhythm. But I\u2019ve still been taking wickets so I\u2019m not disheartened by that. I feel my action is in a good place.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll be doing a little more work leading up to the Test up at Loughborough and with Richard Johnson at Middlesex. Hopefully by the time I get to Headingley, I\u2019ll be firing 100 per cent. This first few weeks it\u2019s been different getting back into competitive cricket having not played a competitive game since the start of January in South Africa. You have to get your competitive head back on. It took a bit of time to find my feet but there have certainly been spells that make me believe that I can have a good summer.\u201d\nFinn missed out on England\u2019s World T20 campaign that ended in final agony through injury but then in an interview claimed he was fit - his anger at missing out apparent. \u201cI was in the wrong,\u201d Finn says of questioning the medical men and selectors. \u201cI\u2019ve accepted that. I've spoken to whoever was affected and everything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s gone. Trevor actually sent me an email and it said use your frustration as motivation to take wickets in the Tests this summer - which was the perfect response to it. You can channel your frustration into the wrong avenues and it can affect you the wrong way. Use it in the right manner and it can be a positive thing.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s certainly a positive thing for Finn to have Ben Stokes in the England line up. The addition of a fourth seamer takes the pressure off someone like Finn, who can have wayward spells, if his radar is on the blink. He recognises that and maybe his run in the side coinciding with the all-rounder cementing his place too is no coincidence.\u00a0\n\u201cThe great thing about having a four-man seam attack with Stokes, who is a proper fourth seamer who bowls 90mph and swings it both ways, is it allows you, if you are having a good day, you can lead from the front and the other guys can fill in behind you and do their roles. On another day when it\u2019s not your day and you do bowl a few bad balls it allows you to settle back into the pack. A four-man attack has helped me in the Tests I\u2019ve played over the last year.\u201d\nAnd Finn will be hoping it helps him in the year to come, too, starting on Thursday at the scene of his game-changing moment."], "environment": ["Germany had so much\u00a0\nAs spotted by \nAs a result, the price of power plummeted, and went negative from 7AM to 5PM, bottoming out at -\u20ac130 per MWh at 1PM.\u00a0\nThe reason for negative energy prices is partly down to inflexibility in the system.

But with improved grid management and power storage technology, sudden spikes could be handled better.\nIn the long run, however, such high levels of renewable energy generation may be good for Germany, a country aiming to transform its electricity supply to \nDenmark regularly sees similar spikes from its network of wind turbines - on one day in July last year, 140 per cent of the Nordic nation's electricity needs ", "More than 80 per cent of people in towns and cities around the world are exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution, the World Health Organisation has warned.\nThe result is that more than three million people die prematurely every year, making the air we breathe the greatest environmental risk to health, a major WHO study found.\nIt also pointed to a sharp disparity between rich and poor: in high-income countries just 56 per cent of people in urban airs were affected by air pollution above safety limits, compared to 98 per cent of those in low and middle-income countries.\nOn average across the world, levels of pollution increased by eight per cent between 2008 and 2013, although most cities in rich countries improved the state of their air over the same period.\nThe highest levels of small and fine particulate pollution, known as PM10 and PM2.5 respectively, were generally found the eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia, with the average annual levels often exceeding five to 10 times the safe limits in low and middle-come states.\nThe city with the world\u2019s highest levels of fine particulates \u2013 of those that actually record the levels, many do not \u2013 was Zabol in Iran, followed by Gwalior and Allahabad in India, Riyadh and al-Jubail in Saudi Arabia.\nHowever Zabol\u2019s problems are largely a natural phenomenon. Every summer it suffers from dust storms in summer known as the \u201c120-day wind\u201d. According to WHO figures, the annual average for fine particulates in the city was 21 times the recommended level and for small particulates it was 26 times.\nBut industrial emissions were to blame in many other cities around the world.\nThe city with the highest levels of small particulates was Onitsha in Nigeria, known for its traffic jams, heavy industry and unregulated rubbish dumps. Its level of small particulate pollution was nearly 30 times the recommended level. It was followed by Peshawar in Pakistan; Zabol, Iran; Rawalpindi, Pakistan; and Kaduna, Nigeria.\nBut even in wealthy countries, air pollution is a significant problem. Paris, where the city has begun to have car-free days to reduce the problem, the WHO found the average annual levels of small and fine particulates were 40 per cent and 80 per cent higher respectively than the recommended levels.\nDr Carlos Dora, the WHO\u2019s coordinator of interventions for healthy environment, said: \u201cIt is crucial for city and national governments to make urban air quality a health and development priority.\n\u201cWhen air quality improves, health costs from air pollution-related diseases shrink, worker productivity expands and life expectancy grows.\u00a0\n\u201cReducing air pollution also brings an added climate bonus, which can become a part of countries\u2019 commitments to the climate treaty.\u201d\nThe WHO said increasing the use of renewable power sources, like solar and wind, and reducing \u201cindustrial smokestack emissions\u201d would help alleviate the problem.\u00a0\nAnd it added in a statement: \u201cPrioritizing rapid transit, walking and cycling networks in cities are among the suite of available and affordable strategies.\u201d\nLater this month a World Health Assembly \u2013 the WHO\u2019s governing body \u2013 will meet to discuss a \u201croad map for an enhanced global response to the adverse health effects of air pollution\u201d.", "Dozens of British cities are breaching air pollution limits\u00a0leading to thousands of premature deaths of \u201cthe youngest, oldest and poorest\u201d in society, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.\nIn a major study, the WHO found more than 80 per cent of people in urban areas around the world were exposed to harmful levels of pollution that\u00a0can trigger fatal asthma attacks and increase the risks of heart disease, lung cancer, respiratory diseases and stroke.\nHealth campaigners said it was clear that Britain was facing an \u201cair pollution crisis\u201d.\nIt has been estimated that the lives of 40,000 to 50,000 people in the UK are ended prematurely every year because of the air we breathe. Worldwide, the WHO said the problem was causing more than three million premature deaths a year.\nTen towns and cities in the UK, including London, Glasgow, Leeds, Nottingham, Southampton and Oxford, were found to have breached what are regarded as safe levels of tiny particles known as PM10. And 39 urban areas also breached the safe levels for another measure known as PM2.5.\nDr Flavia Bustreo, WHO\u2019s assistant-director general for family, women and children\u2019s health, spelled out the situation in no uncertain terms.\n\u201cAir pollution is a major cause of disease and death,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen dirty air blankets our cities the most vulnerable urban populations \nHowever she added it was \u201cgood news\u201d that more cities were monitoring air quality, so \u201cwhen they take actions to improve it\u201d they would know how successful they have been.\nDr Maria Neira, WHO\u2019s director of public health, stressed air pollution was \u201cwreaking havoc on human health\u201d.\nHowever she also said there were signs of hope.\n\u201cAwareness is rising and more cities are monitoring their air quality,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen air quality improves, global respiratory and cardiovascular-related illnesses decrease.\u201d\nEnvironmental and health campaigners called for urgent action to clean up the atmosphere.\nDr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, added: \u201cIt is deeply concerning that 40 UK towns and cities are failing to meet WHO standards for the smallest, most harmful pollution particles.\u00a0\n\u201cThese particles are able to reach deep into our lungs and even into our bloodstream, and can have a serious impact on our breathing and wider health.\n\u201cIt is clear from this report that the UK is facing an air pollution crisis. Unfortunately, the Government's response so far has been inadequate.\u00a0\n\u201cSwift action must be taken to reduce pollution levels in the UK and protect our lung health.\u201d\nAnd Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis is yet another report which shows the air we breathe is unsafe.\u00a0\n\u201cWith 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK from air pollution, what more will it take for our political leaders to act?\n\u201cThis is a public health crisis. It\u2019s time it was treated that way. We need fewer and cleaner vehicles with a Clean Air Zone in every city and large town \u2013 and politicians must urgently introduce a diesel scrappage scheme to get the worst polluting vehicles off our roads, as well as more investment in alternatives to driving.\u201d\nShe said the figures for Europe appeared to have improved \u201cslightly\u201d but added \u201cwe\u2019re still talking about dangerous levels of pollution\u201d.\u00a0\nThe WHO looked at levels of PM10 and PM2.5 particulate matter in 795 cities in 67 countries during the five years to 2013.\u00a0\nThe full list of cities that breached the PM10 levels is: Port Talbot, Stanford-le-Hope, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Scunthorpe, Eastbourne, Nottingham, Oxford and Southampton.\nThe full list for PM2.5 is: Glasgow, Scunthorpe, Leeds, Eastbourne, Salford, London, Southampton, Port Talbort, Birmingham, Stanford-le-Hope, Chepstow, Portsmouth, Stoke-on-Trent, Oxford, Thurrock, Warrington, Armagh, Cardiff, Norwich, Leamington Spa, Newport, Bristol, Wigan, Manchester, York, Hull, Nottingham, Plymouth, Swansea, Carlisle, Prestonpans, Liverpool, Belfast, Londonderry, Brighton, Middlesbrough, Birkenhead, Saltash and Southend.", "Fracking looks set to return to Britain after a five-year gap with a planning officer giving its approval for the controversial gas-extraction technique to be used near\u00a0the North York Moors National Park.\nThe last time the technique was used in the UK \u2013 in 2011 near Blackpool \u2013 it was blamed for causing two minor earthquakes.\nCampaigners say fracking can pollute ground water, result in harmful emissions of gas and should not be allowe\nHowever, the government has been trying to encourage the fledgling industry in the UK after its widespread adoption in the US created a gas boom that has pushed down the cost of oil throughout the world.\nIn a 252-page report, a North Yorkshire Council planning officer recommended allowing Third Energy to begin exploring for shale gas near the village of Kirby Misperton.\nThe report said it had taken into account the company\u2019s environmental statement, claims made by campaigners about the environmental dangers of fracking, the Human Rights Act, the views of people living near the site about their \u201cright to the peaceful enjoyment of one\u2019s property\u201d and \u201cthe right to respect for private and family life and homes\u201d, in addition to a number of other factors.\nAnd, as a result, the officer recommended that planning permission be granted \u201cfor the purpose to hydraulically stimulate and test the various geological formations previously identified \u2026 followed by the production of gas from one or more of these formations into the existing production facilities, followed by wellsite restoration\u201d.\u00a0\nHowever, councillors will make the formal decision at a meeting of the planning committee on 20 May and this could then be the subject of an appeal.\nCampaigners expressed the hope that local politicians would throw out the scheme.\nIan Conlan, from Frack Free Ryedale, said: \u201cWhen democratically elected councillors see the overwhelming opposition from our communities to fracking \u2013 and the votes of Ryedale District Council, all five Ryedale town councils, and numerous parish councils\u00a0\nSimon Bowens, Friends of the Earth's Yorkshire campaigner, said: \u201cWhile it is disappointing that planning officers have dismissed the serious risks of fracking in Ryedale, Third Energy shouldn't be popping champagne corks yet.\n\u201cNorth Yorkshire councillors have been presented with clear evidence that Third Energy's application could harm local wildlife, local business, people's health and the environment.\u201d\nRasik Valand, Third Energy\u2019s chief executive, said it was \u201cpleased\u201d by the news.\n\u201cWe have addressed the wide range of questions, concerns and comments raised by [the council], statutory consultees and others,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThird Energy has been drilling wells and producing gas safely and discreetly from this site in Kirby Misperton for over 20 years and we will continue to maintain the same standards in the future.\u201d\u00a0"], "life-style/food-and-drink": ["If you\u2019re a really big fan of doughnuts, then every week is probably National Doughnut Week for you.

Well you\u2019ve come to the right place. We tried a range of doughnuts from some of the finest bakeries around, and here are the best ones:\nCrosstown specialises in the sort of gourmet doughnuts that you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find anywhere else. And they\u2019re not just unique, but completely delicious, with flavours including chocolate truffle, banana dulce de leche, coffee custard and creme brulee.\nThese are the only Michelin-starred doughnuts on the list, and you can tell. Dusted with sugar and oozing with various fruit fillings \u2013\u00a0including rhubarb, peach and apricot \u2013\u00a0\u00a0they are everything you\u2019d expect from the renowned restaurant.\nBread Ahead got into the gourmet doughnut game relatively early, and has been selling them at London\u2019s Borough Market for the last three years. You can recognise them by the way their fillings come already oozing out of the pastry, with\u00a0\u00a0flavours including\u00a0vanilla custard, orange and cardamom custard, and blueberry.\nIf you're a discerning doughnut lover, then Krispy Kreme may be more of a\u00a0guilty pleasure, but it's a pleasure nonetheless. The chain\u00a0has just launched a limited edition Nutella doughnut called the Nutty Chocolatta, and if you\u2019re one of the many evangelical fans of the chocolate hazelnut spread, then you\u2019ll probably want to get it down you\u00a0right away.\nYes, technically\u00a0they may not be doughnuts.\u00a0But Rinkoff's famous\u00a0crodoughs, also known as cronuts,\u00a0come close enough \u2013\u00a0and are definitely worth trying. Flavours include toasted Nutella and marshmallow, peanut butter and jam,\u00a0and Oreo cheesecake.\nIf the novelty of cronuts and crodoughs has starting to wear off for you, then the next step is to try a biskie by Cutter & Squidge. They\u2019re a bit chewier but with less dough and more fillings to get your teeth into. Flavours include raspberry doughnut, blueberry cheesecake and pistachio roseberry.\u00a0\nDunn\u2019s is the bakery that founded National Doughnut Week, although that\u2019s not the only reason why you should eat their products. They are masters of the classics - from the iced and sprinkled ringed doughnuts favoured by cartoon American cops, to the jam-filled numbers that give you the afternoon sugar rush you need and deserve.\nIf you think a chicken filled doughnut dusted with icing sugar is weird, that\u2019s probably because it is. But while it proved divisive in The Independent newsroom, it\u2019s worth giving a go just for the novelty.

It wasn\u2019t as traumatic as the Father Christmas \u2018discussion\u2019 but it was close. I sympathise. The mere smell of bacon \u00a0in the morning is enough to rouse me from the deepest slumber. Add the heady aroma of coffee brewing and I\u2019m almost ambulatory.\u00a0\nThe good news is that if you want to eat less meat it doesn\u2019t take much pork to flavour a dish. Especially if you\u2019re using chorizo \u2013 a spiced sausage that really pulls its weight in the kitchen. It\u2019s redolent of piment\u00f3n \u2013 smoked chillies \u2013and releases the most lovely scented fat when you cook it. \u00a0\u00a0\nAll of which I love in this simple dish of green beans with chorizo and breadcrumbs. I use only two chorizo sausages and it\u2019s plenty to feed four as a side dish or two as a main. It gets a welcome boost from some extra piment\u00f3n and garlic and homemade breadcrumbs.\nThe breadcrumbs are a doddle. All you need is a bit of day (or two) old bread. I use the last of a lovely sour dough loaf. Tear it into pieces then blitz in the small bowl of a food processor until it forms a coarse crumb. If you have any leftover breadcrumbs simply pop them in the freezer for another day. \u00a0\u00a0\nPiment\u00f3n is smoked sweet paprika from Spain which you can find in most grocery stores or online. Traditionally, chillies were dried over wood fires giving them a lovely smoky flavour. I\u2019ve used the mild piment\u00f3n but there is a hot version too if you\u2019re so inclined. \u00a0And you can omit the chorizo for a vegetarian dish \u2013 simply saut\u00e9 the bread crumbs in a tablespoon or two of olive oil.\u00a0\nServes 3-4 or 2 as a main course\u00a0\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. While the water is heating up, top the green beans by snapping off the stem end (leave the curly tail intact). \u00a0When the water is boiling, salt generously. Add the green beans and cook uncovered for 3-4 minutes. They will go from a rather dull green colour to a more vibrant and deeper green. Test one every minute or so \u2013 it should be a bit flexible, tender but still firm. Drain in a colander and refresh with lots of cold water until cool. Set aside.\nRemove the chorizo from its casing and crumble it up into a frying pan. Cook over medium heat, breaking it up into small chunks until it is lightly browned and the fat is rendered. Remove the fat from the pan and reserve. Add the garlic, piment\u00f3n and breadcrumbs. Stir with the chorizo and add a tablespoon of the reserved fat so the breadcrumbs are nice coated. Cook until the breadcrumbs are toasted. Taste \u2013 it probably won\u2019t need extra salt since the chorizo is a bit salty but adjust if necessary.\u00a0\nRemove the sausage mixture from the pan. \u00a0Add the green beans and a dash of the chorizo fat. Toss to heat up the beans and add in half of the lemon zest \u2013 save the rest to garnish the plate.\nPlace the beans on a serving platter, top with the chorizo and breadcrumb mixture and the remaining zest.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "Buying groceries only to toss them into the street on the way home sounds absurd \u2013 and yet 1.3 billion tonnes of food fit for human consumption is thrown away worldwide each year by both consumers and businesses.\nSuch eye-opening figures have ignited an anti-food waste movement in recent years, to raise awareness of how such behaviour not only harms the environment and exacerbates food poverty but also dents wallets.\nIn the UK alone, almost 50 per cent of the total food thrown away comes from the home even though half of it is safe to eat, according to the Love Food Hate Waste campaign run by anti-waste charity Wrap.\nBut attitudes are changing. Between 2007 and 2012, avoidable waste was cut by a fifth. And if all of the tonnes of produce in the UK currently sent to landfills was eaten, it would save as much energy as removing one in four cars off the road.\nThe latest battle in the war against waste sees online supermarket Ocado pledging produce to The Real Junk Food Project (TRJFP): a network of cafes which intercepts grub before it is trashed.\nFollowing a trial with TRJFP in November last year, Ocado will store food from orders cancelled by customers after it has been picked and packed, to be collected by the charity daily.\nTRFJP turns donations into healthy meals served at its \u201cpay as you feel\u201d cafes across the UK, as well as locations in Europe and Australia. Since 2013, the organisation has reused about 324.8 tonnes of food to create almost 200,000 meals in the UK alone.\nThe supermarket claims to be the first UK retailer to send orders cancelled by customers directly to a charity. However, it is not alone in clamping down on waste.\nIn 2009, leading retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose, Asda, Marks & Spencer and bread manufacturer Warburtons signed up to an industry-wide objective to reduce food waste.\nEarlier this year, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first supermarket to replace multi-buy promotional offers, such as buy one get one free, with lower prices overall after a government-backed report found that over a quarter of consumers are \u201centiced\u201d by deals to buy more than they need.\nThe move followed a 2013 decision by Tesco to drop food promotions after it discovered that 68 per cent of bagged salad, 40 per cent of apples, and under half of bakery items went uneaten.\nCelebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have also rallied against waste with respective campaigns, while restaurants such as Japanese-inspired Itsu have cut the price of food in the evenings.\nHowever, France has gone the furthest, and earlier this year became the first country to demand supermarkets donate food to charities or food banks rather than discarding or destroying it.\nSnact, a firm which sources fruit destined for the bin from farmers and packing centres and turns it into jerky, is among smaller businesses trying to save food from landfills.\nCo-founder Illan Taub believes that food waste is a society-wide problem, and that placing the blame solely on retailers is not the most useful approach.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t value food,\u201d she argues, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve become completely disconnected from our food system and we\u2019ve come to see food as a commodity and just another thing we buy at the shop and discard. We don\u2019t think of how many resources have gone into growing, processing, transporting it.\n\u201cSure, big players like retailers and manufacturers have a responsibility to do something about it because they have the power to make massive changes, but they shouldn\u2019t be singled out.\u201d\nMaking surplus food palatable to consumers has been one of the main challenges faced by Snact since it was established in 2013, and Taub argues that the term \u201cfood waste\u201d hinders the cause.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not food waste, it\u2019s just food. If we stop thinking about it or seeing it as waste, perhaps we\u2019ll start treating it differently too.\u201d\nJustin Horn, the founder of London\u2019s zero-waste pop-up restaurant Tiny Leaf, said working in restaurants and seeing initiatives at work in Amsterdam and New York City inspired him to launch the venture.\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s supermarkets' stringent aesthetic requirements are causing huge amounts of waste,\u201d he argues, but adds that concerns about global warming have heightened awareness and partly helped Tiny Leaf to fill its tables night after night.\nAs they prepare to open their second site in coming weeks, the Tiny Leaf team hope to one day build the first circular economy restaurant, using produce grown in vertical walls.\nMark Linehan, managing director of the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA), praises Tiny Leaf and other zero waste establsihments including TRJFP and Silo in Brighton.\n\u201c[These restaurants] are making the most of food that would otherwise go in the bin and, rather than be seen as somewhere to avoid, have attracted rave reviews.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the SRA itself has tackled the issue with its own campaigns, including a drive to boost the use of \u201cdoggy bags\u201d, at restaurants \u2013 a popular practice in the US.\n\u201cSince the SRA conducted its Too Good to Waste campaign in 2011 restaurant staff have become more proactive in offering their customers doggy bags, which has helped overcome Brits' natural reticence to ask.\n\u201cAs little as three years ago no one gave a second thought to used coffee grounds. Now this brown sludge is being put to serious use \u2013 as furniture, mushroom compost, with restaurants now serving the mushrooms grown with their own coffee grounds, and much more besides.\u201d\nAnd cutting food waste at home is simple. Love Food Hate Waste highlights how planning meals by checking what is in the cupboard before heading to the supermarket; storing food correctly; portioning carefully; and using leftovers can drastically cut waste.\nGetting to grips with the difference between use by and best before dates is also important.\nAdopting such behaviours could make a dent in the 4.2million tonnes of avoidable food waste thrown out by UK households each year \u2013 and save a palatable six meals a week or \u00a3700 a year."], "news/world/africa": ["Four young Egyptians have been detained by police in Cairo after being accused of mocking the government in a satirical video.\nA fifth member of the group, who call themselves the Street Children, was released on bail after being arrested on Saturday.\nMahmud Ottman, a lawyer for the four still behind bars, said they were arrested late on Monday evening while visiting a friend.\u00a0\nMohammed Adel, Mohmmed Gabr, Mohammed al-Dessouki and Mohammed Yehya were remanded in custody for 15 days after being accused of \u201cpromoting ideas calling for terrorists acts by posting a video on social networks and YouTube\u201d, Mr Ottoman said.\u00a0\nThey were also accused of \u201cincitement to take part in demonstrations disturbing the public order\u201d and \u201cinciting mobs to commit hostile actions against state institutions\u201d.\nIn the video they mock the devaluation of the Egyptian currency and the recent return of a two small islands in the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia, \nThe incident is the latest in a series of attacks on journalists, satirists, activists and lawyers by the increasingly autocratic state.\u00a0\nSince the overthrow of the unpopular but democratically elected\u00a0President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, Egypt\u2019s military leaders have gone to great lengths to suppress dissent.\u00a0\nHundreds of people have been sentenced to death in mass trials which have been denounced by the UN.\u00a0\nIn February, a four-year-old boy was sentenced to life in prison in absentia for committing four murders, attempting another eight, vandalising property and threatening police officers after being mixed up with someone else during a mass trial.\u00a0\nIn 2013, \nOne of the journalists, Australian Peter Greste, was released in 2015 and deported.\u00a0\nHis Egyptian colleagues, Baher Mohammed and Mohamed Fahmy, were released a few weeks later after being pardoned by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\u00a0\nA survey by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that Egypt now has the second highest number of journalists behind bars in the world behind China.", "The UN Security Council has expressed alarm at ties between the Islamic extremist group \nIn a statement approved by all 15 council members it demanded Boko Haram \u201cimmediately and unequivocally cease \u00a0all violence and all abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law.\"\nThe Council said they were alarmed at Boko Haram\u2019s links with Isis.

Of course, reducing something as amorphous as culture into one dot on a graph is both difficult and subjective. But her graphs do reveal something interesting about how to successfully navigate cultural differences.\nThe chart combines two different scales. The first scale looks at how emotionally expressive people in that culture tend to be \u2013 whether they raise their voices, touch each other, or laugh passionately when talking, or whether this kind of emotionally expressive behavior is considered unprofessional.\nAs the chart below shows, Meyer places stoic Scandinavians and deferential East Asians at one end of the scale. At the opposite extreme are those cultures where people express their emotions openly and sometimes gesture enthusiastically when speaking \u2013 India, Italy and Spain.\nOn top of this, Meyer adds another scale, which measures how confrontational people in a culture tend to be, to create the 2-D chart below.\nPeople often mix up emotional expression with confrontation, but they are not the same thing, Meyer says -- in some cultures, people tend to be passionate in their speech and expression but don't criticize other people openly, while other cultures embrace the opposite.\nThe upper-left and lower-right quadrants of the graph are probably the easiest to understand, says Meyer.\nCultures in the upper left, like Israel, France and Russia, are direct and easy to read. They tend to express their emotions passionately and their disagreements openly. They typically see disagreement and debate as a positive thing that won\u2019t hurt a relationship, Meyer says.\nThe cultures in the lower-right quadrant are much the opposite, those where emotions and disagreements tend to be expressed more subtly. Countries including Japan, Korea and Sweden are known for being rather emotionally unexpressive. They also studiously avoid open disparagement and take criticism personally, viewing the critique of an idea as a critique of the person who introduced it.\nThe other quadrants are a little more complicated. Countries like the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, in the lower-left quadrant, are not very emotionally expressive, says Meyer. Yet they tend to express disagreement bluntly and openly and believe in the value of open debate to generate truth.

Australian network SBS has broadcast Eurovision for more than 30 years and is a member of the European Broadcasting Union.\nNo. Israel has been competing regularly since 1973 and won three times.

Swedish act Mans Zelmerlow won with his song \u201cHeroes\u201d in Vienna, Austria last year, meaning the 2016 show will take place in Stockholm. If Australia wins, however, the contest will be co-hosted by SBS and a\u00a0European broadcaster member. That way, there will always be a European home for Eurovision and it will be broadcast live at a time when European viewers can watch it. The European country that would host should Australia win\u00a0has not yet been determined.\nIt might be looking that way, but no.

I came like a king, left like a legend.\u201d\nWith LA Galaxy currently at odds of 4/6 to sign Ibrahimovic, a move across the Atlantic could be on the horizon, although whether the MLS club would be able to meet his enormous wage demands remains to be seen.\nUnited are second in the market, with odds of 7/2 suggesting Ibrahimovic could be plying his trade at Old Trafford next season. United manager Louis van Gaal is set to continue his spending spree despite shelling out over \u00a3250m in his two years with United, and while Ibrahimovic would not cost anything in terms of a transfer fee, he will command a huge signing-on fee for his services.\nIbrahimovic has spoken about the possibility of returning to AC Milan, the side he excelled for before joining PSG, though their odds of 10/1 suggest a Milan return is unlikely. In fact, the bookmakers\u2019 believe he has just as much a chance playing for Milan next season as he does West Ham, with the Premier League side also rated at 10/1.\nBoth Arsenal and Chelsea have drifted out to 14/1, suggesting that a move for the forward won\u2019t be happening any time soon."], "life-style/fashion": ["Poufed-out and refreshingly billowy, this spring/summer is a study in volume \u2013 at least, when it comes to the sleeve. Generally, we\u2019ve seen volume in that area of garment geography confined to two specific locales \u2013 the shoulder (Alexis Carrington); or cuff (Stevie Nicks).\u00a0\nThis time, though, it\u2019s all about the bulk. Jonathan Anderson inflated his to approximate nineteenth-century leg-o-mutton styles; Karl Lagerfeld allowed his to billow romatically at Fendi, caught up in a smocked cuff; while for winter Conseulo Castiglioni at Marni followed suit, allowing her sleeves to esc ape and inflate from under ribboned capes, in a chic \u2013 but unexpected \u2013 take on papal chic. Or, perhaps, an unruly blow-up mattress escaping from a drawer.\nIt all looked great on the catwalk. But playing with difficult proportions requires careful consideration, especially when it comes to a basic essential like the sleeve. Shifting this trend from the catwalk to the curb may seem daunting, but luckily for us designers have made it easy. The garments themselves are rather basic - many spinning around nifty adaptations of the traditional white shirt, to establish a well-rounded must-have for spring/summer. Think hefty balloon sleeves cinched at the elbow and tucked neatly into tailored trousers or a slack skirt for a silhouette rendered by volume alone to be entirely on trend. If that sounds a bit buttoned-up, many pushed the sleeves down, baring shoulders, and cutting garments in crisp, bright cottons. Nothing stiffened, padded or tricky about them. Minimum input, maximum impact.\u00a0\nIf you take anything away from this season\u2019s must-have trend it\u2019s to roll up your sleeves and think big.\u00a0", "Suede probably isn't one of the most marketable fabrics when it comes to men\u2019s fashion \u2013 largely because napped leather isn't especially hard-wearing, practical or, for that matter, macho. Only a foolish man would dare to wear a suede coat during the depths of winter. So, unlike its slightly tougher cousin tanned leather, we tend to only indulge our taste for suede with the odd accessory; a new belt or a pair of shoes perhaps.\nHowever, that sartorial mindset can alter slightly come the spring sunshine. And although generally the practicalities of daily life very rarely stop fashion designers from indulging their whims, even they acknowledge that it is only as the weather warms up, that the great push for suede as outerwear can begin.\u00a0\nAnd this spring/summer 2016 was no exception, with the bomber jacket, an integral part of men\u2019s style since the 1950's, given a luxe suede makeover. Jeans-style jackets and the field jacket were also cut from suede too; perhaps mercifully fringed suede numbers were given a wide berth (although the rocker fixations of former Saint Laurent creative head Hedi Slimane have offered those in abundance in recent seasons).\nYour role model here \nStill, there's no escaping the fact that buying a designer suede jacket is an expensive business but thankfully the high street has been quick to replicate, helping you save a few pounds at least.

Even today, he has plenty of passionate supporters.

I get it. After all, I\u2019m a very close relative of his! Although now his body has been found, I might suddenly discover they made a bit of a DNA mistake with me!\"\nRelaxing in an upscale central London bar and sipping a cocktail, the actor exudes a wit and easy-going charm that might surprise people who mistake him for his most famous alter ego, the wired, uptight Sherlock.\u00a0\nCumberbatch is equally amusing when he comes to discussing the end of Richard III. \"I feel very lucky to be almost the last one standing in this play. And no, that\u2019s not a spoiler. The play has been out more than 400 years. You can definitely print that - Richard doesn\u2019t make it. Or maybe he comes back at the end and says, \u2018Did you miss me?\u2019 Or perhaps he could reappear in a car park!\"\nThe 39-year-old son of actors Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham, Cumberbatch studied at the University of Manchester before gaining a Master of Arts in Classical Acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\nThanks to strong performances in work such as \nHe went on to deliver memorable performances in\nNo doubt, the global success of Sherlock has helped Cumberbatch land roles such as Richard III. But he is still rather appealingly taken aback by Sherlock\u2019s worldwide profile. According to Cumberbatch, \u201cThe gob-smacking thing about it is that people who have been icons to me forever have been coming up to me to say much they adore it. When Meryl Streep told me, \u2018I love \nDressed in a blue and white stripy French matelot shirt and dark trousers, Cumberbatch is in very relaxed form today. He seems to be enjoying the downtime after the all-consuming experience of playing Richard III. Cumberbatch\u2019s King is a fiercely driven man bent on avenging himself for the many slights he suffered growing up.\nBut, the actor argues, Richard III is not necessarily the unremittingly evil villain he is often portrayed as; Shakespeare is more nuanced than that. \u201cThere\u2019s all this mythology surrounding Richard. He provokes a polarity of opinion. Is he a bad guy who killed the Princes in the Tower or a good guy who has been much maligned by the play? We don\u2019t really know. A lot of what we have left is still PR.\"\u00a0\n\"We could have had a disclaimer at the beginning of the play saying, \u2018Written by William Shakespeare, who was a playwright in the Elizabethan era, about the last Plantagenet King. Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII, a Tudor, hence its slant\u2019.\"\nRichard spends much of the play, which also stars Dame Judi Dench as Richard\u2019s mother Cecily, Sophie Okonedo as Queen Margaret and Keely Hawes as Queen Elizabeth, getting his minions to do his dirty work and wipe out his rivals for \nBut Cumberbatch, who is married to the director Sophie Hunter and is the father of a young son, insists that the violence in Richard III is never gratuitous. \u201cIt\u2019s not just trying to shock people. It\u2019s saying, \u2018Look at what we\u2019re capable of\u2019. It\u2019s always in context, and it\u2019s always a morality test.\u201d\u00a0\nSo what is it that makes Richard III so hungry for power? Cumberbatch, who read a poem by the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy at Richard\u2019s burial ceremony in Leicester Cathedral last year, traces the disabled monarch\u2019s burning ambition back to his deeply unhappy childhood. \u201cThe important thing is that from the very beginning, Richard is born into this family of Adonises, of athletes of Kennedy proportions. He is the black sheep of the family. He is ostracised and left at home looking after the kids \u2013 which is no place for a man in the medieval world, where it is your duty to go out to fight.\"\u00a0\nSo, Cumberbatch adds, \u201cThere is a real trajectory to Richard\u2019s journey. He is not just the medieval trope of a villain that a lot of critics have said he is. There is great subtlety and lots of back story to this character.\"\n\"Our vision was to humanise him and see his whole story. He loses himself in order to come back in a final moment of stark, cold realisation. He\u2019s lost everything and all he has got left is anger and rage. So to play that whole journey is an absolute treat. And to be able to do it with a camera investigating it when you break the fourth wall \u2013 what a gift for any actor!\"\nLike Frank Underwood in \nCumberbatch comments that, \u201cHe is a compelling because he seduces us to be complicit with his direct addresses to the audience. That tarnishes us because we\u2019re fascinated by the car crash. It\u2019s so seductive because he shows us the fallibility of human nature around the magnetism of power.\u201d\nOne of the feats accomplished by the last series of \nCumberbatch expresses the hope that this series of films, which form the centrepiece of the BBC\u2019s season commemorating the 400th anniversary of the playwright\u2019s death, will also bring a new audience to the playwright. The actor likens it to his hugely popular appearance as \n\u201cI was very keen to see how many could be fitted into the theatre \u2013 that was really important when choosing a venue. I felt it would be unfair to the people who might want to see it if we did it in a small venue. I thought we should be a bit more generous than that and perform it in a big theatre. If you can broaden the audience and show them how brilliant Shakespeare is, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d\nThe other achievement of \nCumberbatch has barely had a moment to pause for breath in recent times. Later this year he will be his starring as the title character in the latest Marvel movie, \nSo what is the actor able to reveal about the next season of \n\u201cYou could tell me,\u201d I reply, \u201cbut then you\u2019d have to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cumberbatch ripostes, gesturing towards the publicist who has just come into the room, \u201cI\u2019d get him to kill you.

Its strong, sleek dancers perform a range of styles and choreographers; this bill also shows off a new intake of dancers, already individual performers.\nGuerin\u2019s Tomorrow follows the production of Macbeth that she created with director Carrie Cracknell for the Young Vic last autumn. It\u2019s an abstract retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s play: there are highly specific gestures, but little direct narrative. Conor Murphy\u2019s designs are minimalist, while Scanner\u2019s music, electronica orchestrated by Quinta, suggests seeping unease.\nThe stage is divided in two. On one side, seven human characters dressed in plain black go through the events of the play. On the other, seven witches in fringed cream costumes gather and seethe. Sometimes the two worlds overlap, one pressing against the other.\nAs storytelling, it\u2019s deliberately obscure. Macbeth and the other characters, they\u2019re all dressed alike, with a coolly neutral performance style; no acting. A threat of death is when one character points at another and turns away; it\u2019s sinister because it\u2019s so understated.

The isolated country recently invited hundreds of foreign journalists (including some from The Washington Post) to cover its rare, once-in-a-generation party congress.\nBut then these journalists were largely restricted from actually reporting on the still-ongoing party congress. Instead, they have been forced to go on media trips to slightly-less-exciting destinations -- state-run wire factories, for example.\nNow, Pyongyang announced on Monday that three visiting BBC journalists have been expelled from the country for \"insulting the dignity\" of North Korea. According to the BBC, correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes was stopped at the airport as he prepared to leave the country Friday.\nHis crew, which included producer Maria Byrne and cameraman Matthew Goddard, refused to board the plane without him. After some wrangling with authorities, the three are now safely in Beijing; North Korean officials say they can never return.\nHow exactly might a foreign journalist insult the dignity of North Korea? Taking a quick look at some of the reports Wingfield-Hayes's crew filmed while in North Korea gives us some clues.\nThe video above, for example, takes a look at North Korea's Kim Il Sung University. As Wingfield-Hayes notes himself in the video, North Korea is \"a country that can be very easily offended,\" and the BBC journalist doesn't exactly mince his words. He describes Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and grandfather of its current leader, Kim Jong Un, as a \"dictator.\" He says the country can be both \"comical\" and \"scary.\" He asks a student at the university about the intentions behind North Korea's nuclear-weapon program, prompting a stern-faced minder to step in to end the interview.\nA BBC journalist, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, who was expelled from North Korea over his reporting, said he was \"just relieved to be out,\" as he returned to his Beijing base on Monday, May 9. (Reuters)\nAt one point, Wingfield-Hayes is shown being accosted by another minder as he tries to film a segment by a huge statue of Kim Jong Il, the father of North Korea's current leader. \"They clearly felt that we said stuff that was not respectful to the great leader, and now we're in trouble,\" the correspondent says. The crew is later shown deleting the footage at the order of authorities. At the end of the video, Wingfield-Hayes suggests that the \"control and nervousness\" his crew experienced betrays the \"weakness and insecurity\" of the North Korean state.\nIn another report filed by Wingfield-Hayes and his crew, included below, the reporter suggests that some of the media trips he has been invited on appear to be staged. \"Everything we see looks like a setup,\" he says. Later, when he tries to ask a female Taekwondo athlete about the United States, she keeps awkwardly quiet as a gang of minders take notes.\nThere's more. In another video (which \nThis is certainly not a rose-tinted view of North Korea. But it's not necessarily different from what many reporters and analysts say about North Korea most of the time. Those who defend North Korea from such accusations are a fringe, to say the least. What's different for Wingfield-Hayes, perhaps, is that he did it in the country at a time when Pyongyang was obviously courting the foreign media in the hope of positive coverage.\nAfter news of his expulsion spread, some North Korea experts wondered whether Wingfield-Hayes did the right thing in taking this aggressive stance in his reporting while in the country -- not because of the hurt feelings of the North Korean state, per se, but because the impact those hurt feelings could have on average North Korean citizens. On Twitter, Gady Epstein, formerly a China correspondent for the Economist magazine, and John Delury, a North Korea analyst who teaches at Yonsei University in Seoul, both expressed worry that such reports could unintentionally hurt North Korean officials and citizens.\nThis is something all foreign journalists have to grapple with when they visit North Korea. The Post's own Anna Fifield, a veteran visitor to North Korea, last year noted that she might be risking the lives of North Korean interviewees if she had \"frank and truthful\" conversations that didn't fit the regime's talking points. But pushing against the regime's limits while in the country was her responsibility as a journalist, Fifield explained. \"After all, I'm in the information business, not the isolation business,\" \n\u00a0", "A young woman reportedly stopped an attempted rapist\u00a0by biting off his tongue - and secured the man's conviction in the process.\nThe attack happened in the Purpan area of Toulouse in southern France, after the 19-year-old woman was followed home.\nProsecutors said the\u00a0perpetrator, a 24-year-old man,\u00a0followed his victim\u00a0into her apartment building\u00a0before attacking her in the\u00a0lift.\nAccording to the \nThe woman then allowed the man to kiss her, and as he did so, she bit his tongue in two, prompting him to run away.\nThe victim then raised the alarm and emergency services arrived at the apartment building soon after, where they found a lot of blood and the end of the attacker\u2019s tongue.\nIt wasn't long before the suspect was tracked down, after police informed nearby hospitals to be alert for a patient missing part of his tongue.

But they can return to class once parents provide proof of immunisation or a valid exemption to Public Health.\nIf the suspension period has passed, the child can return to school even if records are not up-to-date.\nCurrently, parents must report their children\u2019s own immunisation records to their local public health unit directly.\nUnder the proposed changes, health care providers would be required to report vaccines they administer to their local public health unit instead, making it easier for parents.\nMr Hoskins said the changes would reduce unnecessary suspensions due to out-of-date immunisation records.\nChildren in Ontario are required to show proof of immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis (whooping cough), meningococcal disease, and for children born in 2010 or later, varicella (chickenpox) to attend publicly-funded schools, \n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "It is illegal to be a bisexual or lesbian woman in 1 in\u00a04 countries around the world and the number is growing, research has revealed.\nA total of 44 countries criminalise sex between consenting adult women\u00a0and of these\u00a0at least ten countries which have previously only criminalised male relationships have recently expanded their laws to include women. Many of the laws were first instigated under British colonial rule and others are based on Sharia law.\u00a0The report has been \nThe Trust warns that while many countries have historically only criminalised male homosexuality due to the legacy of British colonial penal codes, increased international criticism of the laws is having the counter-intuitive effect of laws being expanded to include women as states believe the legal basis is strengthened if they are gender neutral and therefore more 'equal'.\nThe report finds: \"Ironically, such amendments [to criminalise women] are often made on the inaccurate premise of ensuring non-discrimination in the State's treatment of male and female homosexuals. A Botswana court found that a gross indecency law that only applied to male homosexuals, and not female homosexuals, was discriminatory, but that the discrimination was rectified when the provision was made gender-neutral. Similarly, a court in Solomon Islands found that the male gross indecency law was discriminatory since women were not criminalised, but found that this would be rectified by removing the word 'male'.\"\nThe report warns that while reports\u00a0on LGBT criminalisation can often focus on gay and bisexual men, women experience criminalisation in specific and particularly damaging ways as they suffer from the dual effects of misogyny and bi/homophobia. Corrective rape is found to be common as a way of 'curing' women of same-sex attraction and forced marriages with men are also a continuing threat. As social and economic structures are already designed to require women to be dependent on men, women can experience particular stigma and practical issues if seeking to live independently outside of a 'traditional' relationship\u00a0or with another woman. Another concern highlighted in the report is how restrictions on women's movement in socially conservative countries can often mean it is forbidden for women to travel without a man, making it difficult for women to meet in private.\n\"Women in general are disadvantaged economically in many societies, for example by inequality in family structures, labour markets and laws on property and inheritance, which in turn compound the human rights violations faced by lesbians and bisexual women as they are less able to live independently without male family members. Women [pressured into sham 'heterosexual' marriages] are likely to have significantly less control over their own bodies than gay men who enter sham heterosexual marriages, and may have little control over their sexual and reproductive health choices.\n\"Lesbians and bisexual women are also particularly vulnerable to violence, control and abuse within their own families and by people they know. They frequently experience targeted rape, through which abusers purport to correct a victim's sexual orientation. Much of the research, advocacy and legal discourse around the criminalisation and persecution of LGBT people worldwide has to date inadvertently focussed on the situation of gay and bisexual men. This means that the unique situation of lesbians and bisexual women has not been properly addressed in legal responses to criminalisation.\"", "A loyal pet dog saved a seven-year-old girl from a rattlesnake bite after it leapt to defend her against the poisonous snake.\nThe two-year-old German Shepherd has been hailed a hero by Molly DeLuca\u2019s family, after the brave canine rushed to her aid.\nThe youngster was playing in her back garden in Florida, when unbeknownst to the schoolgirl an eastern diamond back slithered into the yard.\nRescue dog Haus immediately jumped between the snake and Molly to protect her, and was bitten three times.\nThe venomous serpent repeatedly attacked Haus, who stood his ground, and sustained injuries to his kidneys from the toxic bite.\nThe species\u2019 bite is hemotoxic, which destroys tissue, causes flesh to die, and disrupts blood clotting.\nMolly's mother, Donya DeLuca, told Fox 13: \"She saw him jump back, and go forward, and jump back and go forward.\n\"He was just, kind of, holding his ground.

They are hoping that a metal plate fitted inside the man\u2019s left leg between 2001-2005 in Pakistan might lead to a particular hospital or surgeon who can shed light on the mystery.\u00a0", "Experts are calling for new alcohol warnings after a report found some men are drinking more than double the recommended amount.\u00a0\nDrinkaware, an alcohol-industry funded charity, published the worrying findings and suggested more needs to be done to educate people on the dangers of drink. \u00a0\nNew guidelines issued in January lowered the recommended weekly units for men from 21 to 14, the same as women.\u00a0\nBut some 3.5 million men are still thought to exceed 14 units per week, roughly equating to six pints of four per cent, Drinkaware found.\u00a0\nDrinking above that level is thought to contribute to alcohol-related liver disease and cancer.\u00a0\nWorryingly, the study found on average men aged between 45 and 64 were drinking 37 units per week.\u00a0\nAnd some 800,000 were downing 50 units or more per week - equivalent to 21 pints - an amount known to significantly endanger health.\u00a0\nThey concluded that men are not fully aware of how much they are endangering their health, and need more reminders.\u00a0\nElaine Hindal, chief executive at Drinkaware, said: \u201cFor a large number of middle-aged men, drinking is part of their daily routine and often goes unnoticed.\n\u201cAs there are often no immediate negative consequences to their drinking, they are unaware of how their drinking may be impacting on their health.\u201d\nThe research found more than half \u2013 53 per cent - of middle-aged men excessively drinking did not think it would negatively impact their health, even if they continued.\u00a0\nConducted in November but only published this week, the findings also showed nearly half, 49 per cent, thought moderate amounts of alcohol were good for your health.\u00a0\nOther problems associated with drinking were published in a study by Cancer Research UK.\u00a0\nOut of 2,303 adults, middle-aged men were more likely to use alcohol as \u201ca crutch\u201d.\u00a0\nAlmost a third, 29 per cent, felt that despite drinking more than the recommended amount they could not stop themselves.\u00a0\nSome 27 per cent felt remorse or guilt after drinking, and 32 per cent could not fully remember all the night\u2019s events.\nGovernment figures show men in this age group are more likely to be admitted to hospital with an alcohol-related disease.\nThe Alcohol Health Alliance, an umbrella organisation, said people need to be reminded of the dangers associated with excessive drinking.\u00a0\nProf Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alliance, said: \u201cThese figures are concerning, and demonstrate the need for clear and legible health warnings on labels of alcoholic products, which inform the public of the impact of alcohol on health, and of the chief medical officers\u2019 new alcohol consumption guidelines.\u201d\n\u201cAwareness of the link between alcohol and cancer, for example, is particularly low.\"\u00a0\nThey recommended the 14 units be spread evenly throughout the week.\u00a0\nProf Gilmore added: \u201cWhilst there is no level of alcohol consumption which can be considered entirely \u2018safe\u2019 from risk, drinking within this guideline would likely mean a dramatic improvement in health for many of the men identified in this study.\u201d\nThe effects of drinking are thought to cost the NHS \u00a33.5 billion a year.\u00a0", "A trio of youths have been arrested after a man was stabbed and attacked in broad daylight.\u00a0\nHe was stabbed and hit with a baseball bat in the street attack around 5.30pm on Friday.\u00a0\nOfficers added he was known to his attackers.\u00a0\nAll three boys have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH).\u00a0\nGloucestershire Police are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.\nAnyone with information can call 101 or Crimestoppers on\u00a00800 555 111.\u00a0", "The new boss of the RSPCA has vowed to be less political and bring fewer prosecutions as he apologised for the charity\u2019s past mistakes.\u00a0\nThe animal charity recently appointed a new chief executive, Jeremy Cooper, who made an unexpected public announcement distancing the organisation from its previous actions.\u00a0\nHe admitted the RSPCA had become \u201ctoo adversarial\u201d in recent years, focussing on animals rights rather than welfare.\u00a0\nMr Cooper added they had alienated farmers with their stance on badger culling, where they had previously called for farmers who participated to be \u2018named and shamed\u2019. \u00a0\nThe new boss told \n\u201cWe have to be honest and admit the mistakes and acknowledge them.\u201d\nThe fresh direction comes after the 192-year-old charity faced growing criticism and scrutiny, prompting a parliamentary inquiry into its conduct.\u00a0\nOne highly controversial incident was the seizing of 16-year-old family cat, Claude, who was later put down amid allegations of mistreatment.\u00a0\nMr Cooper, 56, said: \u201cClaude the cat was a catalogue of errors.\n\u201cWe have apologised publicly and privately to Claude\u2019s family and it isn\u2019t something we are immensely proud of.\u201d\nThe overhaul comes after a\u00a02014 report by ex-chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, which slated the charity\u2019s prosecution policy.\u00a0\nMr Cooper has confirmed the RSPCA will bring fewer prosecutions going forward, adding at least half of the report\u2019s 33 recommendations have been implemented.\u00a0\nThe group hit the headlines in 2012 when they brought a private prosecution against the Heythrop hunt, Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s local hunt in Oxfordshire, costing \u00a3330,000.\u00a0\nThe new boss has now said it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d they will ever do so again, and all future prosecutions will be passed to the Crown Prosecution Service.\u00a0\nOverall, the number of prosecutions the RSPCA brought last year resulted in 1,781 convictions, but Mr Cooper said he wanted to see that figure come down.\u00a0\nHe said: \u201cThe perception is we have been over zealous. That\u2019s a little bit unfair.\n\u201cI would like to see the number of prosecutions come down.\u201d\nThe new leadership is hoped to spell a new era for the charity, which had seen a worrying drop in donations.\u00a0\nOne of Britain\u2019s largest charities, with an annual turnover of \u00a3124 million, they were without a permanent chief executive until Mr Cooper took up the role last month.\nHis predecessor Gavin Grant stepped down in February 2014 due to medical concerns.\u00a0\nMr Cooper said: \u201cWe are going to be a lot less political. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t stand up for animals.\u00a0\n\u201cBut we are not a political organisation. My style of advocacy is encouragement and dialogue.\u00a0\n\u201cThe [previous] leadership was too adversarial.

This military alliance, based on the premise that to ensure peace you have to prepare for war, demands all members spend 2 per cent of their GDP on the military. This feeds the arms trade which ultimately only profits from war, not peace.\u00a0\nThe EU, on the other hand, has actively worked for peace within Europe and beyond its borders. In recent months, it was responsible for negotiating a breakthrough in Iran\u2019s nuclear talks, something the US could not have achieved on its own. A European Parliament vote for an end of arms sales to Saudi Arabia is a further example.\u00a0\nPeace is a condition achieved through determination and wilful action, not through the threat of military might. The EU\u2019s democratic nations working together can, and do achieve, this.\nThis year more than any other, we would be wise to remind ourselves of the legacy of peace and prosperity that the architects of the EU have left us, and defend it by remaining a part of the EU.\nDavid Cameron may bitterly regret his boast that EU membership will keep Britain safe in future and prevent a third world war.\u00a0Enlarging the union, he insists, will make us more powerful. As well as planned accession of the Baltic states and Turkey, we know that Ukraine is also desperate to eventually join.\nHowever, a large proportion of that country's population regard Russia as their motherland, quite possibly spurring Vladimir Putin or his successor into retaliatory action against Europe.\u00a0It is well known that the Kremlin regards their Crimean base as highly strategic, as we found to our cost in the 1850s.\nFar from enhancing European security, many political commentators blame Brussels and NATO for the current problems in that country.\u00a0I fear the arrogance emanating from Brussels is the chief risk to world security.\nAs is usual when Shakespeare finds himself thrust into the public consciousness, as he was last month for the 400th anniversary of his death, there is a particular quote that always seems to force its way to the front. Although even the most cursory fan could be spoilt for choice, the famous \u201cscepter'd isle\u201d speech, delivered by John of Gaunt in Richard II, seems to be a firm favourite.\nThis time around though, it took on special meaning. With a referendum on Britain\u2019s future in Europe looming, this exhortation of English exceptionalism was seized on by those who think it is just the continent\u2019s shackles preventing Britannia ruling once more.\nBefore they rushed to tweet it and recycle it over a warm pint to boorish friends, however, they should perhaps have kept reading. Just a few dozen lines later, the dying John laments an England turned over to \u201cthose physicians that first wounded thee\u201d and a king who has become little more than \u201cLandlord of England\u201d.\nIn light of the creeping privatisation of institutions such as the NHS and a Tory establishment in thrall to the bankers that brought the country to its knees not even a decade ago, perhaps we should all start reading the Bard a little more closely.\nThe United Kingdom is far too important for its European partners that they would refuse negotiations about vital chapters of the UK-EU relations after the Yes to Brexit. Look at Switzerland: we are not a member country of the EU and have best ties to the EU.\nThe billions of taxpayers' contributions to the EU budget could be used for the British citizens' needs. A million refugees, to which Germany opened its doors last year, would have free passage to the UK once they have proper German papers. This, and more to come, could be stopped at the roots with a Yes to Brexit.\nThe UK will not remain alone after Brexit. On the contrary; EU-critical member and non-member countries such as Switzerland will be ready to help boost UK influence in Europe.\nMy dear neighbours, the UK won two world wars, owned half the world at one point and was a global networker with best links to all countries, whether small or large, long before mainland Europe. Would you agree with me, the United Kingdom will be better off without a supreme government dominated by the most influential country of the EU: Germany? I trust in you and recommend a strong Yes for Brexit.\nOf course Germany had a UK-EU renegotiation veto. So did France; so did Italy; so did the Netherlands. And so did every other member state of the EU too. That's because, on certain matters deemed to be sensitive \u2013 which include just about everything relating to membership \u2013 voting in the EU Council has to be unanimous.\u00a0\nSince the UK is a member of the EU Council and has a vote there that is equal to that of every other EU member state, including Germany, we \nFunny, isn't it, how when we veto proposals supported by every other EU member, we're standing up for the national interest \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 but when others merely indicate that they have concerns with something we're proposing, they're bullying us and imposing their will on us and it\u2019s a national disgrace.\u00a0\nThe history of the last 1,000 years of Europe: war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, plague, war, war, war, war, war, war, plague, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, war, plague, war, war, war, war, war.\nThe creation of the EU after 1945: peace for nigh on 80 years. That's all you need to think about.\nThe political bias is not within the BBC, whose news and current affairs presentation is doggedly even-handed, it is among right wing Tory ideologues who see reds under every BBC bed. Frankly, if those right wingers cannot take a bit of ribbing from lefty comedians on Radio 4\u2019s \nGovernments of all stripes have always resented the BBC and Channel 4's investigative journalism, which regularly lifts the lid on political shenanigans and social ills in our society.\nIt would take an extended article to do justice to the fantastic range of wonderful programming on BBC radio and TV, which millions of UK citizens and many beyond our shores enjoy on an almost daily basis. But the one thing that rarely gets mentioned in these debates is the BBC's crucial role in the classical musical life of our country. This includes not merely Radio 3 itself, but the BBC's stable of in-house orchestras, the BBC singers and the broadcaster's work with other professional choirs, the almost daily sponsorship of live music in concert halls around the country, the encouragement of young musicians, and amateur and school choirs; and to crown it all the world's greatest music festival, and the BBC Proms.\nThe commercial media would never fund a fraction of this activity \u2013 and with a significant further squeeze on budgets, the BBC will not be able to either.\nWhy on earth would any government want to emasculate one of the most admired institutions in Britain? Moderate Tory MPs need to wake up to the true agenda behind John Whittingdale's weasel words about being an admirer of the BBC.\nWhen I went to infant and junior school 50 years ago, I believe we were being constantly tested and assessed. The only difference is that we, as five to 11-year-old children, didn't know; we blissfully unaware how we were being assigned.\u00a0\nFun\u00a0could be had (probably guided by clever teachers)\u00a0in the playground chanting the times tables and silly grammar rules. This was in Hackney, a very deprived area at the time, but it was also in 1957-65 \u2013 a very good era for education.\nI know 10-year-olds now who don't know their\u00a0times tables. They do have other skills, especially verbal and questioning, that are so good they are almost at university level, but all the fun and the sense of belonging to the community around you\u00a0seems to have gone out of it\nIf I was one\u00a0of them I'd ask what it's all for. I'm not sure that the \u201caspiration\u201d to get a \u201cbrainy\u201d job that earns you a lot of money is the answer they would like to hear, or is a sustainable model for the society we might like to build.\u00a0\nThe Standard Attainment Tests are \"so that we understand which children need extra help\", according to a government minister. I am sure the class teacher, who works with the children for several hours a day, week in, week out, already knows this without the need for stressful formal tests. Why doesn't the government simply ask them?\n\u201cThe moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch-goddess success. That \u2014 with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word 'success' \u2013 is our national disease\". Nothing has changed since psychologist and philosopher William James wrote these words in a letter to HG Wells in 1906, 110 years ago. They\u2019re the key to understanding the malaise which gave rise to Donald Trump in the US.\nTrump is a uniquely American phenomenon, and he has to be understood as such. His major appeal is to white working class voters who feel disenfranchised and deeply suspicious of Washington and its machine politicians. For years, they think they've been let down by both political parties. They trust neither.\nThe fact that he inherited great wealth from his father and didn't achieve it himself, and the fact that his businesses have filed for bankruptcy in the past, is ignored. Why they don\u2019t see Trump as a buffoon and a narcissist is something of a puzzle. But for them, he's a success - and they're not; they believe he, and he alone, can makes things better for them through his (apparent) independence of the political system.\nAldous Huxley observed that success demands \u201cstrange sacrifices\u201d from those who worship her. Now one strange sacrifice is all too manifest, and a great worry. It's the closing down of too many minds through blind faith in a false messiah.", "Richard Walker rightly asks in Wednesday's Letters why the assessment and addressing of children's educational needs is not left to their teachers. Could the Government be trying to assess teachers by imposing these tests on children? Surely not!\nHere on the Isle of Man, where I've been fortunate to have spent more than forty years of my teaching career, we abolished SATS and OFSTED inspections years ago, replacing them with our own systems. Inspections are carried out on a local basis and pupil assessment at Foundation and Key Stages 1 and 2 Levels is a teacher-based continuous process. And guess what? The educational sky has NOT fallen in!\n\u00a0\nIs it me, or has Nicky Morgan's expression become more wild-eyed in recent weeks? She seemed such a placid alternative to the wild-eyed Michael Gove before the election. Now she looks either terrified or puzzled. I can't make up my mind whether she looks like a rabbit caught in the headlights or a rabbit sitting a Sats test.\nRegards\n\u00a0\nIn response to concerns about the recent SATS tests sat by pupils in English schools, \u00a0the Department for Education released the following statement: \u00a0\u201cThese tests should not be a cause of stress for pupils - they help teachers make sure children are learning to read, write and add up well. The truth is if they don't master literacy and numeracy early on, they risk being held behind and struggling for the rest of their lives - we are determined to prevent this by helping every child reach their full potential.\u201d\nThis is a masterpiece in rhetorical sleight of hand. It's the modern politician's gift to so conflate words with action, and intention with outcome, that they would have us believe there is no difference between them. The tests \"should not\" cause stress, and so they ignore the clear professional and personal feedback that they do and, in an act of self-deification, say 'because I say it, it is so\". It's insidious. If they had acknowledged the testimonies of the many parents, children and teachers, but stated that the positives still outweighed the negatives, it would at least have been honest. But instead we're asked to believe that the politician's words of intention carry more weight, are somehow more true.\u00a0\n\"The truth\" is something they appear to have ownership of. They assure us that without the mastery of literacy and numeracy skills in early life, children \"risk being held behind and struggling for the rest of their lives\". This is true, but while we focus on this, they hope we won't notice that the idea that these punitive and narrow tests improve literacy and numeracy is deeply contested. In an act of (self?) deceit, we're asked to conflate their apparently altruistic determination to help, with the actual consequences of their actions.\u00a0\nAnd most damning is the subtext that we're asked to accept, a subtext that lies behind our politicians' policies in so many areas of public life: that without the guidance, correction and target setting and measuring of the political classes, teachers would be unable to, well, teach. The tests \"help teachers make sure children are learning to read, write and add up well\". Any teacher worth their salt would tell you the usefulness of such summative testing is very limited, and the sense of stress and failure it can generate can be entirely self-defeating. The very students who are likely to struggle \"for the rest of their lives\" are the very students whose self-confidence and resilience is damaged by tests they know they'll fail. The tests don't help teachers or pupils, but they do help the politicians try to persuade us that they're doing something. Because, presumably, without the politician's \"determined\" efforts, teachers would be damned to accept mediocrity and the failure of swathes of our children.\n\u00a0\nI don't disagree with a lot of what Ben Chu says about public schools ' charitable status. But it is outrageous to describe sports and education facilties as 'peripheral to any educational \u00a0purpose'. Numerous studies have shown what a rounded musical education can do in terms of student achievement. And I don't think, in this day and age, anyone needs seriously to have to defend sport as part of the curriculum. \u00a0Share them, please, but don't cast doubt on their worth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf Boris Johnson is indeed the 'Poster-Boy' for Brexit, as you claim today, does that make Jacob Rees-Mogg the Four-Poster-Boy?\n\u00a0\nPeople who wish the UK to\u00a0remain in the EU\u00a0are using the desperate tactic of\u00a0labelling\u00a0their opponents \"extremists\".\nBritish men\u00a0and women have struggled\u00a0over hundreds of years to\u00a0obtain democracy and freedom, not to be ruled by an unelected, undemocratic and wasteful EU.\n\u00a0\nHeathrow\u2019s latest attempt to convince us that they should have a third runway will cut little ice with those of us who live near the Airport.\u00a0 The Airport Expansion report last July, actually quite sympathetic to Heathrow\u2019s case, conceded that:\na) There was already an \u2018exceedance\u2019 of NOx above the critical level in this area\nb) In the event of expansion a considerably worse scenario would develop with regard to air pollution.\nIn my particular community, just south of the Airport , we have additional worries about new railway schemes related to the expansion plans.\u00a0 The suggested routes involve tracks going round and under the historic and beautiful village of Stanwell which John Betjeman described as \u2018the loveliest village in Middlesex\u2019.\nGiven that Surrey and Spelthorne, the local borough, are pretty uncritically pro-Heathrow expansion the only hope for local residents is that Mr Cameron and his Cabinet colleagues will see reason and refuse the expansion request.", "How ironic that David Cameron is chairing the Anti-Corruption Summit while\u00a0campaigning to remain in the EU.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnly two months ago, a study commissioned by the European Parliament stated that the EU has a corruption problem that could cost it up to 990bn euros annually - including 5bn euros related to public procurement.\u00a0 I wonder if he'll mention that at the summit!\n\u00a0\nIn 1991 the UK government, by Order in Council, abolished capital punishment for murder in the Caribbean overseas territories. So what prevents David Cameron's government from removing the secrecy which makes tax havens attractive with an Order in Council requiring UK overseas territories to make public the beneficial owners of all deposits which have been transferred into their banks from abroad?\nLeading politicians of every stripe bloviate about the evils of tax havens, but do nothing practical to close them down. Our nation is sovereign over a large number of tax havens, yet politicians behave as if these scraps of territory bleeding income from the public purse were actually owned by some mighty foreign power with which we dare not interfere.\n\u00a0\nIt was bemusing to see Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s latest gaffe, labelling Nigeria and Afghanistan as being \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d.\nOf course there is corruption in both these countries, but it is clearly rather hypocritical given that this is largely at the connivance of the UK, which through its 17 tax havens in Crown Dependencies has for decades harboured funds exported by wealthy individuals. This has come to the fore most recently through the so-called Panama Papers.\nThese tax havens are governed by the UK Crown, so what we are witnessing is one huge state-sponsored tax avoidance machine.\nIndeed, the anti-corruption organisation, Transparency International, has said that the UK is a \u201cbig part of the problem\u201d of corruption in Nigeria where c. 40 per cent of Nigerian GDP is effectively stolen.\n\u00a0\nThe article \u2018Jeremy Corbyn has a toxic relationship with the media \u2013 but he\u2019s the one to blame\u2019 (Andrew Grice, 11 May), is breathtaking in its ability to blame the victim for bullying, and make no mistake: the \"toxic relationship\" is of the media's making.\nJeremy Corbyn's hammering by the press and broadcast media began in the form of belittlement, then incredulity and finally fear, well before \" Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s operation\" came into being. For him to readily cooperate with his bullies would follow a pattern which never works in other situations \u2013 such as the school playground.\nThe persistent and unjustified attacks he has undergone were never likely to be halted by appeasement, nor do I believe that anyone to the left of David Miliband could ever find favour with those in the party who were shocked by his brother Ed's victory over David. Since then for the right wing or 'moderates' of the party, attempting to undermine and oust both Ed and Jeremy has been the only game in town - regardless of the harm to Labour's election prospects.\nJeremy Corbyn's team should clearly improve its issue of information, but should be wary of the 'helpful' advice offered by Grice. Greeks bearing gifts?\n\u00a0\nAlex Salmond's contention that the Holyrood voting system should be amended is breath-taking.\u00a0\nHe maintains on his London radio show that how our votes are counted must be changed. He's concerned Nicola Sturgeon achieved somewhat fewer seats - in fact, six - than he did in 2011 with a fractionally highly percentage - \u00a047 per cent against 45 per cent - of votes cast, and consequently lost her majority - which doesn't make Salmond a happy chappie.\u00a0\nBut did we hear the ex-nationalist leader moan when he won outright in 2011 or whine about the unfairness of the 2015 general election voting system when the SNP achieved just under 50 per cent of the votes and were gifted 95 per cent of the seats, including his own?\u00a0\nIf anyone didn't realise from the SNP's refusal to accept the referendum result that they're more than a tad selective when supporting democracy, they should now.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStephen Crabb MP, who took over from Duncan Smith, has indicated that there will be further\u00a0 disability benefit cuts. He was one of those MPs outed on social media for huge expenses claims in the past. Some of their names are attached. These claims by Crabb\u00a0included \u00a3500+ for rugs, \u00a38,000 to refurbish a home he\u00a0 then sold and \u00a3600+ for a chair.\n\u00a0\nThe EU is not undemocratic and unelected: our elected government has a direct input into the process of legislation, and we elect MEPs who do the same. It may be different from the UK; but it includes the power of our people rather than excluding it.\n\u00a0\nThe public respond negatively to public figures when they act without integrity in hidden aspects of their lives, but present a different public persona.\nIntegrity is measured by what we do when people aren't watching . By this standard\u00a0 Emma Watson has failed her public.", "As one might expect, the issue of taking children out of school during term time for unauthorised absence has dominated our national news today, as one parent managed to persuade the courts to overturn the decision to impose fines levied by his daughter\u2019s school. I believe this was the right decision but it does pose a problem for schools.\u00a0\nAs the former chair of Somerset Schools Forum, and now chair of the Corporate Parent Board, which oversees the welfare of all children looked after in the county, I am well aware of the adverse impact that poor attendance can have on shaping a child\u2019s future.\u00a0\nWhat is worrying about this case is that Jon Platt is clearly articulate and had done his homework, making his decision to take his daughter out of school for a family holiday during term time in full knowledge of the consequences. I fear that this may open the doors for less responsible parents to do the same.\nOn the other hand, regular attendance is important but what we must not forget is that merely attending school is not the same thing as the child in question learning something of value. In my role as a councillor, I know only too well of many councillors who regularly attend meetings but who gain nothing, and contribute even less, by their attendance. It is not unheard of for colleagues, in full view of the public, to be reading a newspaper, tweeting their mates or completing crosswords.\u00a0\nWe must remember that there are many ways to learn, and many places in which to do so. While classroom attendance is important, it is not nearly as valuable as achievement.\nWe must not forget either that there remains a real issue for working parents trying to juggle their leave entitlement to fit in around school terms, along with the price hikes inflicted on them by travel companies. There are no easy answers but the decisions taken by those in authority do need to be challenged, if for no other reason than to open up the debate.\u00a0\nWhat appears not to have been addressed is how the fines imposed were to be used; to boost the schools diminishing budget perhaps?\nPrivate schools are not self-serving 'clubs' as described in Ben Chu\u2019s lively invective.\nMost independent schools are charities which receive certain tax breaks. This is a benefit which is gratefully received. However, some charitable independent schools would be perfectly willing to relinquish the label of 'charity', because of the way commentators seek to simplify a complex picture.\nThrough charitable status, schools have a duty to work for the public benefit. Without it, there would be fewer bursaries. Bursary support is at an all-time high of \u00a3850m. A third of all students get fee assistance and 5,000 pupils pay no fees at all. Are these pupils the kittens of Chu\u2019s \u201cfat cats\u201d?\u00a0\nDo we really want to see the disappearance of an excellent education for those who couldn't normally afford it?\nChu's world is one of division. He cites high-ranking politicians in the assumption that their successful schools must have done wrong in some way. He looks at the impressive facilities of private schools in a way which suggests these don't also exist in many state schools. He points to static numbers of scholarships without noticing that the money is now better targeted at means-tested support. He focuses on fee increases without considering the financial pressures schools face.\nIndependent schools are often expected to feel guilty about their success. Success should celebrated and shared, not vilified. \u00a0\nGlobally, the UK's independent schools are held in the highest regard. Parents from all over the world choose to send their children to British schools. What is it that those from outside the UK can see that some here cannot?\nAnd let's not forget what schools give back to the whole of the UK \u2013 roughly \u00a39.5bn at last count, generating \u00a33.6bn in tax revenues and saving the taxpayer \u00a33bn.\u00a0\nIndependent schools aren't going anywhere. Those who wish to engage rather than snipe will find tens of thousands of dedicated teachers working in our schools who strive for exactly the same thing as their state sector counterparts \u2013 a quality education and opportunity for all children in the UK.\nWith regard to the BBC, as far as I am concerned there is too much sport and far too much spent on it. I do not watch cricket, football, snooker or tennis, to say nothing of innumerable other sports \u2013\u00a0cockroach racing for all I know. I consider this a complete waste of my share of the licence.\nDavid Cameron has not apologised to Suliman Gani as an article in Thursday's\nWe all know this is untrue, as\u00a0Cameron was quite specific when he told parliament that Sadiq Khan had shown poor judgement by sharing a platform with\u00a0Gani nine times. The Prime Minister,\u00a0speaking in the House of Commons, said Gani supported Isis and held questionable views about women and gay people. His intent was clear, to smear both \u00a0Khan and Gani as jihadi-supporting Muslims.\nRather than hiding behind a sleight of hand statement to dig himself out of a hole of his own making, the Prime Minister\u00a0needs to stand up in parliament and apologise to both\u00a0Gani and Khan for besmirching their reputations in a most despicable way, and to the British people for trying to influence the London mayoral contest by spreading untruths.\nNeither a welfare state nor, for that matter, a living wage is compatible in the long run with open borders. Staying in the EU with its free movement of labour accord has consequences.\u00a0", "John Major has expressed his disdain for those who raise immigration as an issue in the referendum. I would say the same of Ken Clarke, but I\u2019m not sure his tone reflects more than his habitual affectation of boredom, which I take as an attempt to suggest his point is so self-evidently true that he shouldn\u2019t really need to be making it.\nI do however, share their objection to hearing immigration\u00a0mentioned in the debate. The issue is net immigration. Which part of the word \"net\"\u00a0do they not understand?\nShorn of that word, concern over immigration is open to the fatuous response \u201cbut our people go over there too\u201d, ignoring the difference in quantity. The demographic significance of that difference is even greater when we factor in age profiles. Younger and older migrants cannot be counted as equivalent; the former tending to reproduce and the latter not.\nAbbreviating \"net immigration\"\u00a0to \"immigration\"\u00a0conveniently creates the impression of Brexiteers having an aversion to ethnic mixing. It also suggests that the tiresome Brits are carping again about something which everyone else in Europe is happy with. But they can hardly be seen as happy with something they haven\u2019t actually experienced and probably wouldn\u2019t tolerate for long if they did. Whether by accident or very cunning design, most of their countries do not attract a substantial surplus of arrivals over departures.\nA conspicuous counter-example to this is Germany. Why their apparent equanimity? They are that rare phenomenon, a nation with an intelligentsia even more racked with racial guilt than the British. There as here, to notice that your share of the population and gene pool is in sharp decline would be a thought crime.\nI have long passed the point where I don\u2019t want to hear anything further from either camp in the EU Referendum campaign (I won\u2019t call it a debate!). I feel very insulted by both sides\u2019 assumption that I will take their increasingly wild and desperate lies, distortions and misrepresentations as actual \u201cfacts\u201d. Are the protagonists so arrogant as to think that the public are that gullible (a rhetorical question!)\nThe rather brutal real truth is that it won\u2019t matter in the medium to long term whether we stay in the EU or leave. The reason for this statement is that if the EU continues with its present policies and plans it will fail financially, economically, socially and politically probably within about the next 30 years. It has already started to fail on the financial front and that will continue to worsen because the underlying assumptions on which it proceeds are fundamentally flawed. The increased financial pressures and consequential economic downturn combined with ever-growing migration problems both from with the enlarged EU and externally will produce increasing social unrest, more incidents of separatist terrorist acts and possibly even one or two small scale intra EU wars. Whether we are in or out of the EU we will be deeply affected by all of this.\nPeople may say that my analysis is grossly pessimistic, to which I would reply that it is merely realistic. If you stand back and look without bias at the EU and its members now, its plans for the future and the world situation and if you use history as a guide, you will see the logic of the conclusion.\nThe only way I can see to avoid my scenario being fulfilled is for the EU to start formally dissolving itself now in an orderly fashion. Will that happen? Of course not. There are too many people with vested interests (whether financial, political or personal) who will not allow that to even be considered. So there is nothing we in the UK can do to stop the inevitable eventual collapse of the EU or avoid its devastating effects.\nIn Letters,\u00a0PJ Manasseh bemoans the amount of sport on the BBC and states \"I do not watch cricket, football, snooker or tennis\".\u00a0\nI would love to know which BBC channel the cricket is on and when.\nCan we please cut through the smoke-screen spin about cheaper holidays causing term-time removal of children from school. There is a fundamental principle at issue here: the right of taxpaying parents to determine their child\u2019s education, not those whom they pay.\u00a0As far as I am aware, subject to the requirement of regular attendance at school, there is nothing in relevant statutes and regulations,\u00a0preventing the parent from removing their child from school at and for such times as they see fit, or\u00a0requiring them to ask the head teacher (whom they pay) for permission to do so. \u00a0\nAnd what is the legal basis for local government automatically fining those who have not breached the regular attendance requirement? \u00a0Presumably all such fines levied in the past are illegal or ultra vires, and should be refunded? It does seem to be yet another case of bureaucratic jacks-in-office bullying those who do not have the confidence, knowledge of the law or means to oppose them. \u00a0\nThe recent court ruling on this subject prompts me to wonder why parents are not punished for allowing their children to be off school due to illness.\nSurely in the event of sickness teachers, children and parents should, and hopefully do, work together to catch up on any missed lessons. Why shouldn't pre-agreed holiday in term time be treated in the same way? In that way a holiday would defer learning rather that cause it to be completely missed.\nAdditionally, you have to ask why a week of missed teaching could have a severe effect on a child's education. Is it because they are face to face with the teachers for too short a time? My local secondary school has lessons from 8.30 to 3pm; adding another hour onto that day would increase time for lessons and better prepare children for the real world once known as \u201c9 to 5\u201d.\nMs Cox, who describes herself as \u201con the left of the party\u201d and \u201cdefinitely not a Blairite\u201d (Jeremy Corbyn could face leadership challenge next month, Labour MP suggests, Andrew Grice, 13 May) yet voted for Liz Kendall: surely mutually exclusive?\nShe continues \u201cJeremy needs to accept that we are trying to be critical friends.

What we need to figure out now is whether there should be additional recommendations about just what an optimal dose is throughout pregnancy.\u201d\nAnd Dr Daniele Fallin, director of the Bloomberg School's Wendy Klag Centre for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, said: \u201cAdequate supplementation is protective: that's still the story with folic acid.\n\u201cWe have long known that a folate deficiency in pregnant mothers is detrimental to her child's development.\n\u201cBut what this tells us is that excessive amounts may also cause harm. We must aim for optimal levels of this important nutrient.\u201d", "The youngest ever example of a mummified human foetus from Ancient Egypt has been found in a discovery that shows \u201cjust how precious the unborn child was\u201d to people at the time, experts have said.\nThe pregnancy lasted for 16 to 18 weeks, according to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge where staff used a special kind of CT scan to determine the age of the unborn child.\nIts coffin, which was just 44cm long, was excavated at Giza in 1907 by the British School of Archaeology.\nJulie Dawson, head of conservation at the Fitzwilliam Museum said: \u201cThis ground-breaking find educates us further still in our conception of just how precious the unborn child was in Ancient Egyptian society.\n\u201cThe care taken in the preparation of this burial clearly demonstrates the value placed on life even in the first weeks of its inception.\u201d\nTutankhamun\u2019s tomb contained two mummified foetuses, but they had died after about 25 weeks and 37 weeks of gestation.\nThe Giza coffin was a miniature version of those used during the Ancient Egyptian Late Period, dating from between 664BC and 525BC.\nIn a statement, the museum said: \u201cThe diminutive wrapped package inside was carefully bound in bandages, over which molten black resin had been poured before the coffin was closed.\n\u201cFor many years it was thought that the contents were the mummified remains of internal organs that were routinely removed during the embalming of bodies.\u201d\nHowever, the experts decided to try to find out for sure. An X-ray proved inconclusive so it was then decided to use a micro CT scan.\n\u201cThe cross-sectional images this produced gave the first pictures of the remains of a tiny human body held within the wrappings, which remain undisturbed,\u201d the museum said.\n\u201cFrom the micro CT scan it is noticeable that the foetus has its arms crossed over its chest. This, coupled with the intricacy of the tiny coffin and its decoration, are clear indications of the importance and time given to this burial in Egyptian society.\u201d\nThe skull and pelvis had collapsed, but the fingers and toes and the long bones of the legs and arms could all be seen.\nIt is thought that the foetus died as the result of a miscarriage but there were no obvious signs of why the child did not survive to term.\nThe coffin is currently on display as part of an exhibition at the museum, called ", "People who \nThe study, led by \nDuring his resarch, Professor Swami recruited 420 participants from the ages of 20 and 78, and asked them how strongly they believed in conspiracy theories like the supposed \nHe then assessed their \nOverall, the study found that the stronger their belief in conspiracy theories, the more \nThe participants came from varying demographics, but the results stayed consistent across the board - younger people were slightly more likely to believe in conspiracies, but there were no significant differences in belief between women and men, or different social classes.\nProfessor Swami, whose study has now been published in the \n\"Stressful situations increase the tendency to think less analytically,\" he explained. \"An individual experiencing a stressful life event may begin to engage in a particular way of thinking, such as seeing patterns that don't exist.\"\nTherefore, stressful events may lead to the development of a conspiracist mindset. Once this change has occurred, other theories may be taken on board more readily.\nHe believes the second reason is down to feelings of control and understanding which conspiracies can provide to stressed people.\n\"In the aftermath of distressing events, it is possible that some individuals may seek out conspiracist explanations that reinstall a sense of order or control,\" he said.", "Robert Hare, the psychologist behind the 20-item test that has become known as the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, says psychopaths, which he estimates account for 1% of people, could be the result of an evolutionary process.\nDespite decades of studies, the specific origin of why people become psychopaths remains unclear. The vast body of scientific work on psychopathy focuses on anomalies in brain\u00a0structure and function as well as\u00a0the impacts of external factors.\u00a0\nBut new research suggests it may be an evolutionary process.\nSpeaking to \n\u201cYou can pass on your genes by having one or two children and investing a lot into their well-being. But we know psychopaths\u2019 relationships are impersonal, that they favour the strategy of having a lot of children, and then abandoning them.\u201d\nWhile unpalatable to most people, he argues this method of reproduction means psychopathy should be considered a biological adaptation rather than a neurological disorder.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom an evolutionary psychology perspective, the structure and functions [of psychopaths\u2019 brains] may be a little different,\u201d Hare added. \u201cBut they\u2019re properly designed for engagement in predatory behaviours. They could be genetically programmed, but what trigger mechanisms might set genes off? We don\u2019t know. But we know that environmental factors are also a determinant.\u201d\nHare also believes that psychopaths are capable of responding to therapy programmes and can even use their condition to their advantage in a way that\u2019s productive for the individual and society.\u00a0\n\u201cMy view is that psychopaths have the intellectual capacity to know the rules of society and the difference between right and wrong \u2014 and they choose which rules to follow or ignore,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPeople will say the behaviour is pure evil, but what does that mean?\u201d", "Scientists have discovered that existing drugs can\u00a0make cancer cells \u201cliterally just get stuck\u201d, preventing them from spreading throughout the body.\nNormally on the move constantly, cancer cells quickly run out of\u00a0nutrients and oxygen amid the crush of a rapidly growing tumour.\nThis means they are forced to leave the tumour to invade different parts of the body or die. About 90 per cent of the human\u00a0deaths from the disease occur after cancer spreads to other parts of the body.\nResearchers funded by the US National Cancer Institute have now found a key part of the process that enables the cells to move and managed to disrupt it in laboratory tests.\nWhen the treated cancer cells were injected into the breasts of female mice, they grew into large tumours but did not spread to the lungs, liver or bone.\nTeam leader Professor Kay MacLeod, of the Ben May Department for Cancer Research at Chicago University, said the researchers had decided to find out what would happen if they stopped a process called autophagy in cancer cells.\u00a0\nAutophagy plays a housekeeping role in healthy cells, clearing out damaged material and misshapen proteins, eliminating pathogens and helping to defend against cancer.\nBut when genes associated with autophagy were knocked out in the cancer cells, it prevented them from moving.\u00a0\n\u201cThey literally just get stuck. Through the microscope, you can see the cell wobbling, trying to move, to put out new protrusions, to migrate,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it can't.\u201d\nCancer cells move by pushing protein \u201cadhesions\u201d through the front, sticking onto something outside and then pulling itself forward, the researchers found.\nAfter the cell has gone past an adhesion, the protein is disassembled and broken down by autophagy. But if that process is disrupted, the rear adhesion remains attached.\n\u201cIt is stuck, unable to dissolve the adhesions at the back end of the cell,\u201d Professor MacLeod said.\n\u201cBasically, autophagy-deficient tumour cells cannot migrate and as a result cannot travel to another location. This is why we think that inhibiting autophagy could block tumour metastasis.\u201d\nShe added that their work suggested that inhibiting autophagy could be \u201can effective approach\u201d to stopping the spread of cancer, or\u00a0metastasis, in human patients.\nA paper about the results of the study in the journal Cell Reports noted there were already drugs capable of disrupting autophagy.\nOne of them, hydroxychloroquine, is currently used in the UK to treat rheumatoid arthritis, malaria and other conditions.\u00a0It is also being tested in clinical trials as a way to slow the growth of tumours.\n\u201cBut it is not being specifically evaluated as a way to prevent metastasis,\u201d Professor MacLeod said.\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s where this approach of inhibiting autophagy will be most useful as an anticancer measure.\u201d\nNell Barrie, Cancer Research UK\u2019s senior science information manager, said cancer was \u201cmuch harder to treat\u201d once it had spread from the initial tumour.\n\u201cSo understanding how cancer cells are able to move around the body is a crucial area of research,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThis study suggests that existing drugs might be able to stop a \u2018recycling\u2019 process inside cancer cells that helps them to move.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting approach that\u2019s in its very early stages and will need to be tested further in the lab and in clinical trials before we know if it could help tackle cancer spread in patients.\u201d", "If your job, or simply your state of mind, depends on feeling empathy for others, you might want to reconsider reaching for the Tylenol the next time you have a headache.\nIn research published online in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Ohio State University describe the results of two experiments they conducted involving more than 200 college students.\nTheir conclusion: Acetaminophen, the most common drug ingredient in the United States, can reduce a person's capacity to empathise with another person's pain, whether that pain is physical or emotional.\n\"We don't know why acetaminophen is having these effects, but it is concerning,\" senior author Baldwin Way, an Ohio State psychologist, said in a statement. \"Empathy is important. If you are having an argument with your spouse and you just took acetaminophen, this research suggests you might be less understanding of what you did to hurt your spouse's feelings.\"\nIn the first experiment, 80 participants were asked to drink a liquid. Half the subjects received something containing 1,000 mg of acetaminophen. The other half got something without the drug. After an hour, all subjects were asked to rate the pain experienced by characters in eight different fictional scenarios. In some of the stories, the character went through a physical trauma, in others an emotional trauma. In general, those subjects who had taken the acetaminophen rated the pain of the characters as less severe than those who had taken the placebo.\nA second experiment exposed participants to brief blasts of white noise. They were then asked to rate the pain of another (anonymous) study participant who'd also been subjected to the unpleasant sounds. Again, those who had received the acetaminophen rated the other person's pain as being less severe compared to students who'd drunk the placebo liquid.\nAs a further test, in which participants had to judge online skits involving social rejection, they split along the same lines as in the noise experiment.\n\"In this case, the participants had the chance to empathise with the suffering of someone who they thought was going through a socially painful experience,\" Way said. \"Still, those who took acetaminophen showed a reduction in empathy. They weren't as concerned about the rejected person's hurt feelings.\"\nThe two experiments build on previous studies identifying a brain region that appears to be key to a person's empathetic response. The anterior insula, located deep in the folds between the front and side of the brain, \u00a0is where mind and body are integrated. It also plays a key role in human awareness, including emotional awareness. The less pain a person feels, the less able he or she is to empathise with someone else's.\n\"Because empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior,\" the authors note, \"these drug-induced reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side effects of acetaminophen.\"\nAcetaminophen is an ingredient in more than 600 different medicines, according to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association. About a quarter of all Americans take acetaminophen every week.", "A joint team of American and British scientists have developed \nThe robot, created by researchers from the \nOnce inside the stomach, the robot's\u00a0origami structure unfolds, allowing doctors to move it around from outside the patient's body with magnets.\nThe robot's two outer layers sandwich a material which shrinks when heated by the body.

It's really difficult to control and place a robot inside the body if the robot is attached to a tether,\" she said.\nBradley Nelson, from Zurich's Federal Institute of Technology, called it \"one of the most convincing applications of origami robots that I have seen.\"", "The reasons why it is common for animals to engage in sexual behaviour with others of the same gender has long puzzled evolutionary biologists.\nAfter all, it doesn\u2019t actually lead to the production of offspring and the continuation of the creature\u2019s genes.\nBut now researchers in Sweden have discovered that genes which encourage beetles to engage in what they call same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) can also be evolutionarily advantageous to the opposite sex.\nWhen they bred male beetles selectively for SSB, they found that \u201ctheir sisters laid more eggs and produced more offspring than before\u201d. And breeding females for SSB resulted in genes that helped the males reproduce.\nProfessor David Berger, of Uppsala University, said: \u201cOur findings show that studying the genetic links between different characteristics in males and females can hold major clues to how genetic conflicts between the sexes shape the evolution of traits, and same-sex sexual behaviours are just one example of this.\u00a0\n\u201cThe genetic mechanism explaining the occurrence of SSB that we demonstrate in these beetles could apply equally well in very different animals.\u201d\nSeed beetles go through a courtship ritual before attempting to mate. In the males, they then mount their partner from behind and insert their version of a penis.\nSex between males carries a small but significant risk as the penis can get trapped in the wing casing of the other male, leading to the death of one or both. Sex between females, the researchers said, was \u201cless pronounced\u201d with no risk of death.\nAnother of the research team, Dr Alexei Maklakov, stressed that beetles were very different to humans.\nFor example, the beetles bred for SSB would still mate with females. Some of the genes concerned were linked to the idea of \u201copportunity cost\u201d, Dr Maklakov said.\u00a0\nWhile some beetles spend time working out if another beetle is of the opposite sex before mating, others deploy a scatter gun approach and there is an evolutionary play-off between the two.\nThe first group might miss chances to mate, while the second might get tired out due to too much attempted sex.\nDr Maklakov stressed it was important not to try to read too much into their research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to extrapolate directly in any way from animals to humans,\u201d he said.", "It is hot.

If Djokovic\u2019s 7-5, 7-6 victory appeared to confirm the hold he has over the man who was for so long regarded as the king of clay, the match was also evidence that Nadal is close to recapturing some of his best form.\u00a0\nThis was Djokovic\u2019s 11th victory in his last 12 matches against Nadal, who has now lost the last 15 sets he has played against the Serb. Nadal, however, should have won the second set, in which he squandered five set points on his own serve. The outcome might have been very different if he had converted one of them.\nDjokovic, nevertheless, completed his 16th successive victory against top-10 opponents with a display that combined brilliance with resilience. Some of the world No 1\u2019s defence was exceptional as he kept returning Nadal\u2019s best shots, often with interest. No wonder Djokovic is the favourite to win the French Open, which begins next weekend, even though he has never won the tournament before.\nIn the Open era no two men have faced one another more often than Nadal and Djokovic. This was their 49th meeting and their sixth at the Foro Italico. Djokovic, who now leads their head-to-head record 26-23, was playing in the quarter-finals here for the 10th year in a row, while Nadal was appearing in his 11th quarter-final in his last 12 visits.\nDjokovic, who won the Rome title in both 2014 and 2015, has now won his last 13 matches at the Foro Italico, but from the start it was clear who had the most support in the crowd. Fans the world over love Nadal for his flair and passion.\nNadal\u2019s comeback this year following all his troubles in 2015 has captured the public\u2019s imagination and he will go to Paris with his self-confidence restored. Nevertheless, the fact that he will be seeded No 5 at Roland Garros means that he could meet Djokovic in the quarter-finals again, as he did when losing to the Serb in Paris last year.\nNeither player looked in trouble on serve until Nadal broke in the fifth game. Three games later, however, Djokovic broke back, his relentless pressure forcing the Spaniard into mistakes.\nDjokovic took the set by breaking again in similar fashion four games later. Nadal dug deep to save the first four set points but Djokovic converted the fifth in magnificent style after one of the rallies of the year. Having retrieved a smash, chased down a drop shot and leapt to hit a winning volley, the Serb bellowed out a characteristic roar of celebration.\nThe world No 1\u2019s reaction was rather different at the end of the following game, at the start of the second set. After putting a forehand wide on break point, Djokovic hurled his racket to the floor. Having failed to break the racket at the first attempt, he tried to finish the job on his way back to his chair.\nAfter two more games Nadal sent for the trainer, complaining of numbness in his left foot, which had been heavily strapped. The strapping was removed and the Spaniard did not appear to be in any difficulty when play resumed.\nHowever, when Nadal served at 5-4, Djokovic saved five set points. While the Serb defended heroically and kept forcing his opponent to play the extra ball, there was a sense that Nadal never quite had the conviction to seize the moment.\nDjokovic went 0-30 down on his serve at 5-5 but once again held firm. His confidence was evident when he won one point with a brilliantly improvised shot, hitting a winner from one baseline to the other with what was almost a half-volley.\nNadal always trailed in the tie-break after missing a backhand on his own serve on the third point. At 6-4 Djokovic converted his first match point, hitting a backhand winner after outrallying Nadal in a gripping baseline exchange. In the semi-finals he will meet the winner of the concluding quarter-final between Kei Nishikori and Dominic Thiem."], "arts-entertainment/art/features": ["Another year, another \nThe four artists are nominated for solo exhibitions, most of which are abroad and unavailable for many of us to have seen. Hamilton was nominated for \u201cLichen! Libido! Chastity\u201d at the SculptureCenter\u00a0in New York. This reflected her continuing interest in mining sexualised images from the internet. This appropriation of images is clearly shown in the centerpiece of that show, Project for Door (after Gaetano Pesce) a recreation of an unrealized work from the 1970s by Pesce, an Italian architect, which was originally destined to be the front entrance of a Park Avenue apartment block. The frankly inappropriate image of male buttocks is quasi-obscene and would have been hilarious if it had been realized as to its initial plans. I last saw Hamilton\u2019s work in Edinburgh in British Art Show 8 where she had injected an ant farm into a sculpture. Needless to say the ants had all died, a rather gratuitous addition to an otherwise inert sculpture.\u00a0\nMarten\u2019s practice, according to Tate\u2019s press release, \u201cattracts and intrigues, while also resisting interpretation and categorization.\u201d Like Hamilton, Marten predominantly relies on the internet to mine her images, using language in her titles to again provoke a feeling of misunderstanding. She is certainly inclusive in the use of the materials that she uses to make her works. Shown in the Venice Biennale, Lunar Nibs has as its \u201cingredients\u201d a pickle, a bowl of fish skin, coins and cotton all mashed up together into a colourful composition that we are told is \u201cdeliberately meant to both seduce and perplex us\u201d.\u00a0\nPryde barely made the Turner cut, being 49 (the top age is 50). She was nominated for her solo exhibition \u201cin Thinking By the Person i Am\u201d (deliberately subverting language or grammar in her title) at CCA Wattis, San Francisco. Pryde predominantly uses photography to explore issues of both gender and consumerism. In San Francisco her \u00a0photographs were disrupted, another curatorial word, \u00a0by the addition of a large model train that the viewer was invited to sit upon and ride on to peruse the exhibition, reinforcing the contemporary ideal that the experience of going to a gallery should be fun.\nDean has been nominated for \u201cSic Glyphs\u201d, a show at South London Gallery. More purely sculptural than the other nominees, this is easier for the viewer access. Dean\u2019s personal concerns of language and co-option of contemporary materials such as rebars, a material used in construction and favoured by artists like Ai Wei Wei, may inform the work but they are, unlike the other artists, less opaque in their delivery. There is pleasure in this work and pleasure in the making.\nThe Turner Prize desperately needs to reinvent itself. Firstly it needs to get rid of its now obsolete rules \u2013 no one over age 50; the artist has to live and work predominantly in the UK (unless you are Tino Seghal in 2013). The restrictions were imposed to protect British artists from international competition, but with a global art world, as clearly seen in the places that these exhibitions have been held, they now seem parochial and foolish. The top age limitations means that \u201clate bloomers\u201d such as Phyllida Barlow and Rose Wylie never got a chance to be nominated to this still important prize. And important it is. While I am writing this piece and the ink is not yet dry on the press releases, the galleries are sending out congratulation notices to their nominated artists.\u00a0\nIn 1997 I appeared on Channel 4 after the announcement of the Turner Prize as part of a debate positing the question as to whether painting was dead. The short list that year was all women, Christine Borland, Angela Bulloch, Cornelia Parker and Gillian Wearing\u00a0(Gillian Wearing won) and not a painter in sight. I was defending painting and its central role in art. Famously Tracey Emin stomped out, making it wonderful television for all the wrong reasons. Looking at this year\u2019s list, and recently having walked around the British Art Show 8, it seems the defense is still necessary. Painting certainly is dead to a certain breed of curator if not to the public in general. Being slippery and perplexing is just not enough; let\u2019s give our viewers something to enjoy and fill our minds so we may remember it the next day.\u00a0"], "extras/saturday-magazine": ["What happens to your brain when you walk into a shop and are faced with a huge, ultra-high definition, 3D television at the startling price of \u00a337,695? Assuming you fools who might buy it. And then, very sensibly, you start looking at more reasonably priced options, maybe at around the \u00a31,500 mark. You have just been successfully manipulated. Welcome to the world of anchoring.\nThe above is precisely what happened to me, and it happens to all of us. Anchoring is a type of cognitive bias where the mere presence of an initial number can have a disproportionate influence on subsequent decision-making. The outrageous price of the TV serves as an anchor that nudges customers towards spending more than they want. In other words, the price subconsciously influences your expectations about what you would be willing to pay. Safely back at home, the thought of spending \u00a31,500 on a TV seems once again impossibly extravagant.\nThis example illustrates three key properties of anchoring. First, and perhaps most importantly: it really works.\nUnlike many recent findings in psychology that fail to replicate, the anchoring effect is easy to demonstrate and repeat. For instance, in one experiment, a group of participants was asked whether Mahatma Gandhi was more than 140 years old when he died. Another group was asked whether he was aged over nine. No one got that question wrong, of course, but when they were asked what age he actually was, the former group said 67, while the latter said 50. For what it\u2019s worth, Gandhi was 78 when he died. The mere presence of an initial number, however ludicrous, changes the perception of what is reasonable.\nThe effect is not limited to the lab, but shows up robustly in the real world. In the court room, the damages awarded are strongly influenced by anchors and even sentencing can be affected. In salary negotiations, the starting position influences the final outcome, indicating the importance of making that initial offer.\nThe second key thing to bear in mind: everyone does it. Every time you buy an item \u201con sale\u201d, you experience anchoring. The original price influences your expectations so the 25 per cent discount feels like a real bargain. Similarly, cars don\u2019t cost the sticker price \u2013 that\u2019s just there to anchor your expectations, so negotiating a lower price makes you feel like you got a good deal. And as we have seen with the TV example, retailers take advantage of anchoring with in-store displays featuring extremely expensive items so that the nearby products look better in comparison. You will even use it when setting the asking price on your house when it\u2019s time to sell.\nOccasionally, companies get it wrong. A large retail chain in the US thought it was a smart move to eliminate coupons and instead create \u201ceveryday low pricing\u201d. Unfortunately for them, they didn\u2019t consider the effect of anchoring, and sales quickly dropped. When they reversed their policy, customers started returning. We need that anchor to inform us that we\u2019re getting a bargain.\nAnd that leads on to the final aspect of the phenomenon: no one is immune. Even when you are aware of cognitive biases, you can still be affected by them and anchoring is a particularly strong bias. Judges are experienced, well-trained, and highly motivated decision-makers, but even they can still fall prey to systematic biases in their judgments. And despite the fact that I have been teaching psychology for nearly 20 years, you\u2019ve already heard how I fell for it.\nSo how can you stop getting caught out? The truth is that anchoring is probably impossible to avoid entirely. You can, however, minimise its influence by following some simple steps:\n1. Be aware. Just by knowing what anchoring is and how it can affect your decision-making, you limit its effectiveness. Obviously, recognising a nudge is a good start. But it is also worth being aware of your own thought processes. Some research suggests that people are particularly susceptible to cognitive biases when they are happy, making them less critical in evaluating their environment and their own judgements. Just to be clear, I am not suggesting you deliberately put yourself in a foul mood before going shopping with the family.\n2. Do your homework. The more information you have about a product and its price range, the less susceptible you are to anchoring. So before making a significant purchase, get as much unbiased information as you can. Consumer advocacy groups such as Which? or Consumer Reports provide independent, evidence-based evaluations of products and services as well as a comparison of prices and are probably a good place to start.\n3. Set limits in advance. If you can decide on price limits before going out, then you are far less likely to go beyond them and make a rash decision. If you know, for instance, that you don\u2019t want to spend more than \u00a315 for a bottle of wine, then you are less likely to pick up the \u00a325 bottle, even though it\u2019s a bargain compared with the Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothchild next to it.\nUltimately, cognitive biases such as anchoring are fundamental to human decision-making and we\u2019re stuck with them. In truth, we probably wouldn\u2019t want to reject them entirely because most of the time they provide rapid shortcuts that work well and save us a lot of mental effort. The flip side is that we are mostly unaware of it happening and, if we\u2019re not careful, a clever bit of anchoring can see us merrily walking out of the shopping centre clutching a futuristic TV, thinking we\u2019ve just bagged an incredible bargain.", "I, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester, Lord Protector, loyal brother (ahem) to one king, loving uncle to another mysteriously vanish\u2019d (though I never knew a thing of that, not a dickie bird), called Dickon by some, Crookback by more, King Richard of England for too short time, later of the City Council Car Park, New Street, Leicester LE1 5PS (special rates weekends and bank holidays), latterly reinterred in seemly place...I, Richard III, am now about to write the curious story of my afterlife.\nYet that misleads where no deception\u2019s meant. \u2019Tis not merely, nor even mostly, of my own afterlife I shall write. For that may all too swiftly be thus condensed:\nNo, reader, the afterlife concerning us here is that of my most wellbeloved association football club.\u00a0Leicester Fosse as was, Leicester City as is, Foxes to friend and foe alike, whose King Power arena stands but a mile from the church wherein I now lie. Those Foxes who, little more than one brief year ago, lay ensnared in relegation\u2019s trap, encircled by ravening hounds, their route to safety obscure unto the eye.\nYet from those depths we did rally and revive. Premier litter runts one spring reborn, we were rulers of the league the next. Aye, \u2019tis Leicester\u2019s salvation from a shameful grave, and not so much my own, of which I write. And if I played a ghostly part in that, \u2019tis not for me to speak of preternatural things. The question must nonetheless be asked, for who would leave this tale unexplor\u2019d? How was last winter of our discontent made glorious by that son of Yorkshire, the Sheffield-born Jamie Vardy, and the steely bunch of misfits at his side?\nThis question is asked in realms across the globe. Discredited they were as fools and knaves. Marooned at foot of table, distended from the rest by many points, magnet for contempt across this land, as once I was, inexorably we were headed for the drop. Yet now of those brave warriors \u2013 of Vardy who once did make prosthetic limb, and of Mahrez, the Moor from Maghreb come; of Kasper Schmeichel, the Viking between the posts, of Huth, forsooth, and of others too \u2013 the world entire speaks in reverent tones.\nI have hinted meekly at the truth, for fear of charging centre stage when I be better hidden in the wings. But let me put the question now in clear and ringing terms, for dissembling is a fault in English kings. Was the confluence of my reburial and Leicester\u2019s revival naught but chance? Or by lying close to the Foxes\u2019 ground, supine though I am and wrapped in shroud, was I a Moses to part the foamy tide, and lead my boys towards the promised land? Coincidence? Or king power?\nDecide this for thyselves. I say nothing either way.\nTo you it falls, descendants of my subjects, to judge whether the Prince who fell at Bosworth Field, the last of England\u2019s kings to die in war \u2013 you think you\u2019d have caught one of those powdered Hanoverian ponces wielding a sword? Or that lascivious buffoon Charles II, who slavered over that buxom bint with the oranges? \u2013 is Leicester City\u2019s salvation. All I will do is state these barren facts. Perchance they tell a tale upon their own.\n\u2019Twas on 5 September 2012 that men and women with spades \u2013 \u2018archaeologists\u2019, in the modern parlance \u2013 located the Church of Grey Friars in Leicester town, where a monument to me was known once to have stood, beneath ranks of metal motor horses serried in their oblong bays above. I would not dwell upon the dusty past, for memory gives cause for melancholy yet. But it was there within that church, after I breathed my last one August day of 1485, that I was hastily laid to rest, without the ritual or the honour due my rank. And there it was that my waxen flesh decayed, until spine-curved skeleton was all that did remain.\nIf ever you saw the stage amusement bearing my name, as writ by that girlish, meretricious bard, you\u2019ll know me for a wretch with hunch for back. A pitiful freak to all with eyes, like that Frankish git who roamed another cathedral by the Seine. True it is that when I was a child, and ventured forth beyond Fotheringhay Castle walls to take the airs, the boys who could not play for want of ball would point towards my back, accusing me of theft until I, enraged, replied: \u2018How many times? I haven\u2019t got your fucking ball.\u2019\nIf neither the curving of spine nor yet the withering of limbs were so great as some have made them look \u2013 you can\u2019t legislate against Tudor propaganda \u2013 a pretty sight I never was, for sure. It was not in sooth entirely a hunch, but a malaise that came upon me as a child to twist me out of form.\nIdiopathic scoliosis is the doctorly term today. Google it at leisure for thyselves. I do not beg thy pity for my shape, invert\u2019d cur and hideous though I was. But kicking an inflated pig\u2019s bladder, with fellows of my age \u2013 if not my rank \u2013 was a childhood joy denied me by this fate.\nLike Clau-Clau-Claudius of Rome, lame stammerer who for a halfwit was mistook, I was not by nature shaped for sportive tricks. Deform\u2019d, unfinish\u2019d, sent forth before my time, I could not run or frolic with my contemporaries. But love the game I did from infant days, when nurse would make me stand between the posts, kicking inflated pig\u2019s bladder towards her target while I, tiny custodian, did dive across the goal.\nAnd again like Claudius, who long before me grew to rule where none foresaw, you could have got longer than 5,000\u20131, from the turf-accountant firm of WagerFred, against me taking the title coveted by all. The odds when I was born, the 12th of 13 babes to slither from one mother\u2019s womb, in the autumntide of 1452, were in the many millions sure enough. Yet that longed-for title I eventually did seize. My path to throne was winding as my spine, and how I journeyed isn\u2019t swiftly told. Do Google, once again, if fancy takes. But don\u2019t believe each and every word you read. Those were dangerous, violent times, and demanded stringent measures. We could not afford to be angels in those days.\nAnyway, suffice it that I became the king in summertime of 1483, when I not long since had 30 turned, after my brother Edward IV left this earth. Tragically uncrowned was his son Edward V. Lovely kid, and so was his brother, Richard of Shrewsbury. Straight up \u2013 and yes, thanking you, I get the irony of that, stooping crookback that I was \u2013 you couldn\u2019t put a price upon my grief when my nephews vanished from the Tower, though how or where they went none truly knows.\nSo it was in their absence that, come July that year when they were handing out the sceptres, it was I who received the premier title of England, the last of the House of York anointed in sight of God. Funny old game, monarchy. All men crave it, and most would yield their lives merely to play the game of thrones at all. Yet uneasy hangs the head that wears the crown, for menace of dethronement cleaves ever close. Know who\u2019d confirm that? Nigel Pearson, twice our\u00a0gaffer at Leicester City, that\u2019s who. Nigel\u2019s first spell as ruler endured but two years, like my own. Then he fell, though at the hand of our club chairman, the Slavic invader Milan Mandari\u0107, not one of warlord Henry Tudor\u2019s strikers with an axe.\nYet now and again a king doth rise again. Our Lord Jesus did so, gospel states, and so did my brother\u00a0Edward IV, who was ousted by the Lancastrian Henry VI only to slaughter Henry (with a little help from his friends and relatives, truth be told) and be restored as king. Like my brother, Pearson soon enough regained his throne. In 2010, ownership of Leicester City passed to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the leader of a company of men from the distant eastern land of Old Siam, who call themselves King Power Duty Free. Though by the thrice-beshitten shroud of Satan, what witless gibberish is that? For tell me how the power of a king can from onerous chains of duty e\u2019er be loosed?\nWho now would gainsay the wisdom of such words? Yet in autumn of 2011, it struck the ear as a sardonic chant. For my Foxes languished low in the second tier, the so-called \u2018Championship\u2019 (I can\u2019t be doing with these rebrandings. Second Division\u2019s still good enough for me), when Srivaddhanaprabha restored Nigel to his coachly post.\nTime and space are short, so we must leap ahead in mighty bounds. One year after Pearson\u2019s restoration, I was discovered in car park tomb. Eighteen months after that, in May 2014, we rose again to the highest league, whither and thither we have yo-yo\u2019d for so long. The Premier League season did commence in August of that year, and hand on heart, our fortunes prospered not. A burst of joy when we thumped Man United 5\u20133 at home soon enough gave way to direst gloom. Christmas found us propping up the league, far adrift from every other club. In all the years that passed, but twice had Yuletide stragglers escaped the drop.\nThe New Year brought no succour, and in February all seemed lost. So did Nigel Pearson for a time. At home to Crystal Palace, trailing and fated to lose by one to nil, this bullish man did squeeze a rival player\u2019s neck. It later spread abroad that he was gone, discharged. He thought himself that P45 was his. Yet a change of heart was had, and Pearson stayed, and gaffer still was he next month when the car park I forsook.\nOn 22 March of the year 2015, my skeleton was carried in procession to Leicester Cathedral, where four days later I duly was interred. The Archbishop of Canterbury attended, and members of the ruling house. Insultingly minor members, I might add. My namesake Duke of Gloucester (gormless old buffer) and Prince Edward\u2019s missus, the Countess of Wessex. Would it have killed them to send a big gun like Philip, Prince of Denmark as well as Greece? Or Charles, who doth converse with flora to fill the time while waiting upon his queenly mother\u2019s death?\nBut what doth it profit us to carp? Besides, the day was not a dead loss. That prancing mime Benedict Cumberbatch did read aloud an ode, as writ by Carol Ann Duffy, the laureate of the land:\nWell, I\u2019m sure it made sense at the time. Anyway, speaking of the Resurrection of the Dead, five days before my sepulchral rites were read, the Foxes travelled south to take on Spurs. You recall Harry Hotspur from \nPretty perusal it hardly makes, for all that game in hand. The portents worse could not have been. No team had e\u2019er escaped so late from so cavernous a pit, distended seven points from survival\u2019s berth (17th place, for the hard of comprehending) with but nine games to play. The first encounter after my burial was done brought West Ham\u2019s blue and claret to our ground. With bare four minutes left upon the clock, the match tied up at just one goal apiece, it fell to a King \u2013 as so perforce it should \u2013 to loose the bonds of doom that crushed our bones.\nThe wily Pearson had sent on Andy King, a Foxes valiant of many years, in place of one who left for dugout\u2019s rest. And King it was who won the match for us, scrambling home when Vardy mishit in haste. Once lit, the torch of revival grew quick to blaze. West across the Midlands we fared next, to the Hawthorns, there to meet West Brom. A deficit of 1\u20132 when just ten minutes did remain was flipped upon its head in thrilling style. \u2019Twas Robert Huth, our lion of Biesdorf, who levelled by heading home from close. And then came drama wholly unconstrained, in time added by the ref for wounds and woes, when Vardy, racing clear from bare halfway, did shoot the ball an inch inside a post. Three\u2013two to the Foxes.\nSeven days later, goals unanswered from Leonardo Ulloa and Adam King again did for Swansea City. Another week. Then to hateful Lancashire we went, where on the hour a Vardy party came when Jamie the winner scored at Burnley\u2019s home. Reminding us the sailing\u2019s seldom smooth, we then did lose at home by three to one to Chelsea, poised to win the Premier League under aegis of a Portugueser of whom more anon.\nBut then, God be praised, the miracle resumed. Newcastle first and then the south coast Saints were vanquished without concession of a goal. And though at Sunderland no goals were scored by either side, the season\u2019s finale was a veritable Foxes landslide, a 5\u20131 thumping of poorly Queen\u2019s Park Rangers, who took the 20th spot that once seemed the destiny of us alone.\nI won\u2019t bang on again about what part I played \u2013 if any part at all, however slight \u2013 in raising the living dead to vibrant life. Nor will I remind you that those Foxes, doomed for sure when came the Ides of March, won seven of their final nine after I was reinterr\u2019d, and finished in respectable 14th place. The seeds of legend soon to come to bloom were in those few short weeks sown in fallow ground. And to our heroes each we\u2019ll come anon. But what of Pearson, doughty helmsman who steered us free from rocks? What lustrous reward lay in store for him? Aye, there\u2019s the rub.", "Judge Dredd\nDredd \nIn the story \"Burger Wars\", written by veteran Dredd scribe John Wagner (under the pen name TB Grover) and drawn by Mike McMahon, the Judge gets embroiled in a battle between the remnants of two of America\u2019s biggest burger chains, which\u00a0have devolved into warring factions headed up by the Burger King and a familiar if eerie mutated clown called Ronald, who runs MacDonald (sic) City.

Mr Buhari, who was elected on a promise to crackdown on corruption, said he would \nThere was also renewed criticism for the Government over its failure to secure agreements on transparency measures from all of its Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, as it emerged that the British Virgin Islands, one of the most popular offshore tax havens among those individuals exposed by the Panama Papers, had not been invited and would not be attending the summit.\nA cross-party group of MPs sent a letter to Mr Cameron warning the Prime Minister that he urgently needs to get Britain\u2019s own house in order on global tax evasion by ending corporate secrecy in British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies.\n\u201cWe respectfully submit that if territories under British authority are left free to give harbour to publicly anonymous corporations, then Britain\u2019s achievements and credibility in the global anti-corruption movement will be undermined\u201d said the letter from the Global Organisation of Parliamentarians Against Corruption. It was signed by the MPs Margaret Hodge, David Davis, Nigel Mills and Catherine McKinnell.\nWhile the Prime Minister has pledged to strip away corporate secrecy in relation to the ownership of companies in Britain, he has stopped short of exerting pressure on UK overseas territories and dependencies such as the British Virgin Islands and the Bahamas to meet the same standard of transparency. A recent agreement between the Government and the territories enabled them to retain the option of keeping registers of the beneficial ownership of companies closed to public inspection.\nCampaigners say this loophole will continue to enable tax evaders and corrupt politicians from all around the world to stash their money offshore, hidden from the sight of tax and legal authorities.\nIn a clear warning to Mr Cameron, the authors of the letter said that substantive proposals to close this loophole would determine whether the summit is ultimately seen as \u201can exercise in words or on deeds\u201d.\nA number of countries and territories sending representatives are due to announce further crackdowns on corruption. Forty jurisdictions, including some of the UK\u2019s Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies with major financial centres, have signed up to a deal to automatically share beneficial ownership registers with other countries.\nMr Cameron said ahead of the summit: \u201cThe evil of corruption reaches into every corner of the world. It lies at the heart of the most urgent problems we face \u2013 from economic uncertainty, to endemic poverty, to the ever-present threat of radicalisation and extremism.\n\u201cA global problem needs a truly global solution. It needs an unprecedented, courageous commitment from world leaders to stand united, to speak into the silence, and to demand change.\u201d\nFifty countries will be represented at the summit, alongside international organisations including the IMF, OECD and World Bank. The leaders of 11 countries, including Norway, Sri Lanka and Tanzania will attend, while Secretary of State John Kerry will represent the United States.\u00a0", "War, violence and natural disasters have forced a record number of people from their homes with the number of internally displaced refugees now at 40.8m, a new report has revealed.\u00a0\nThe study by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (DMC) found that an average of 66,000 people a day fled their homes in 2015.\u00a0\nThe NRC Secretary, General Jan Egeland,\u00a0\n\"It is\u00a0the equivalent of the combined populations of New York City, London, Paris and Cairo grabbing what they can carry, often in a state of panic, and setting out on a journey filled with uncertainty\", he added.\nInternally displaced means refugees who have remained within their own country\u2019s borders -

which I will push for so long as there is breath in my body - is for everybody to [introduce public registers] - not just picking on small islands but I'd like to see the United States of America, China, India, everyone.\u201d\nThe summit also saw commitments from 11 new jurisdictions to join group of 29 countries, including the UK, that share information on companies\u2019 true owners with one another.\nMr Cameron said the summit had \u201cbroken the taboo on talking about corruption\u201d.\n\u201cToday we have seen the world unite against a shared enemy. Countries have gone further than ever before in condemning corruption and pledging to drive it out,\u201d he said. \u201cThis battle will not be won overnight, but if we continue to show the courage and political will to stand against corruption that we have seen today, we can and will defeat it.\u201d\u00a0", "A group of tax havens have accused larger countries like the United States of \u201chypocrisy\u201d when it comes to cracking down on tax avoidance.\nWith the issue of offshore finance high on the agenda in light of the fall out from the so-called Panama Papers scandal, world leaders convened in London on Thursday to agree new measures to take on the issue.\nAt the summit, world leaders from six countries \u2013 Britain, Afghanistan, Kenya, France, the Netherlands and Nigeria \u2013 agreed to publish registers of so-called \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d. These lists help authorities identify who really owns companies and to crack down on tax avoidance.\nBut offshore havens such as the Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, and Bermuda\u00a0criticised larger countries \u2013 notably the US \u2013 for asking them to sign up to public registers of beneficial ownership when they held themselves to lower standards.\nThe tiny US state\u00a0of Delaware is in particular notorious for hosting US corporations that are physically headquatered in other states.\nThe state, which has a population of under a million people,\u00a0has very few taxes and a significant proportion of its public budget - over a quarter - is raised from incorporation fees.\nCompanies listed there benefit from significant tax advantages compared to more developed areas which have raised taxes to fund the infrastructure that makes business possible.\nAlden McLaughlin, premier of the Cayman Islands, accused the larger countries of deploying \u201crhetoric\u201d but taking little action themselves.\n\u201cIt is time to put behind us the shades of hypocrisy that have been part and parcel of this discussion for years and years,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is little point in us continuing the rhetoric if we are going to continue to allow major countries to remain outside the standard.\u201d\nBob Richards, deputy premier of Bermuda, said that UK and the US had also built favourable tax climates.\n\u201cThere are more billionaires per head of population in Britain than anywhere else and that\u2019s not because of the climate, it\u2019s because of the tax climate,\u201d he argued.\nAllan Bell, chief minister of the Isle of Man, additionally \nOffshore finance was just one of the issues discussed at this week\u2019s summit, which was about corruption in general.\nDowning Street said the new register to be implemented in the UK would mean \u201ccorrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London's property market, and will not benefit from our public funds\u201d."], "news/world/americas": ["Texas Lt Gov Dan Patrick called for the resignation of a school superintendent over his implementation of restroom policies that allow transgender students the use of facilities consistent with their gender identities.\u00a0\nFort Worth Independent School District superintendent Dr Kent Scribner said he will not resign from his position following Mr Patrick\u2019s call.

He is expected to be released from prison before the end of the week.\u00a0\nOfficials voiced their concern for the family of the victim, but also sought to say sorry to Mr Bryant for the years of his life that have been lost.\u00a0\n\u201cMy heart also breaks for Malcolm Bryant, who was only 25 years old when he was sentenced,\u201d State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said at a press conference. \u201cSo on behalf of the criminal justice system, I would like to apologise to Malcolm Bryant and his family.\u201d\nAfter Mr Bryant\u2019s tried in vain to insist on his innocence from behind bars and exhausted all avenues to appeal his conviction, his case was taken up by the Baltimore Innocence Project which then brought it to the attention of the prosecutors\u2019 office.\u00a0\nThe new testing of evidence had been ordered by Ms Mosby\u2019s. \u00a0Results obtained late last year failed to match Mr Bryant to the victim.\u00a0\n\u201cThe only plausible explanation...is that the DNA is in fact that of the killer and the DNA does not match that of Mr. Malcolm Bryant, which means he is not the killer,\u201d Ms Mosby said.", "The extraordinary political turmoil in Brazil reached a watershed on Wednesday as members of the Senate neared a final vote to suspend President Dilma Rousseff from office for up to six months and put her on trial for alleged misdeeds in economic policy.\nEven as the nation watched agog as a full day of mostly sober debate was broadcast on live television before a final vote expected later in the evening, it appeared all but certain\u00a0that a simple majority in the upper chamber would be mustered to take the movement to remove Ms Rousseff to the next step.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no path for us but opposition,\u201d the most senior Senator of the President\u2019s ruling Workers Party, Senator Humberto Costa told reporters, essentially acknowledging that a loss for the president and himself was nigh.\u00a0\nIf so, Ms Rousseff, 68, will officially be suspended on Thursday and her place will be taken by Michel Temer, who has been serving as Vice President. A senior member of the Workers Party indicated that Ms Rousseff was already preparing to dismiss her entire cabinet to allow Mr Temer, who leads the Democratic Movement Party, to choose his own ministers.\nThe extraordinary drama has come at a time when Brazil is enduring its worst economic recession since the 1930s, thanks in part to crashing oil prices, and has been treated to a long torrent of revelations of corruption and graft connected to Petrobras, the national oil giant, that has seen numerous Worker Party figures put in prison or put under investigation.\u00a0\nNo allegations of corruption have been leveled at Ms Rousseff, but as a former chairman of Petrobras at a time when the corruption within it was already rife, the scandal has tainted her.\n\u201cPlainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards,\u201d Boris Fausto, a Brazilian political scientist and historian, commented to reporters earlier this month.\nIn a statement on the Vatican\u2019s radio website, Pope Francis voiced his concern for the situation in Latin America\u2019s largest country and a neighbour of his own Argentina. \u00a0He called for \u201cprayer and dialogue\u201d and said he hoped that Brazil \u201dproceeds on the path of harmony and peace.\u201c\u00a0\nAdding to the national malaise is the medical emergency created by the fast-spreading Zika virus. In the meantime, the country is trying to galvanise itself to welcome the world to the Summer Olympic Games in August, plans for which have encountered problems of their own, not least worries about heavily polluted water threatening events like rowing.\nThere has been a rise recently in Brazilian markets amidst first tiny glimmers of economic recovery as well as hope that Mr Temer, whose is seen as being more pro-business than the leftist ruling party, will take steps to attack the deficit and tame public spending.\u00a0\nWhile he may be looked upon appreciatively by the business community, Mr Temer is politically deeply unpopular with only 2 per cent of voters saying they would actually choose him to lead Brazil. He also faces a monumental task getting the economy back in order, experts agree.\n\u201cTemer may enjoy a honeymoon with markets for some weeks, maybe months, but when investors come to realize that the fiscal results will not improve fast enough, then we could see some disappointment later this year,\u201d said Bruno Lavieri, an economist with consultancy 4E, in Sao Paulo.\nAnalysts will be scrutinising the Senate vote to see what hope, if any, Ms Rousseff may have of surviving the trial itself. \u00a0For her to be ousted for good, she would have to be convicted by at least a two-thirds majority in the 81-seat Senate. \u00a0If that were to happen, Mr Temer would in theory serve out the remainder of her second term which runs until the end of 2018.\u00a0\nAfoot also is a retreat from power of the Workers Party which has governed Brazil, the world\u2019s seventh largest economy, for the last 13 years. Ms Rousseff was the chosen successor of former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, known simply as Lula, who ushered in a \u00a0rare streak of economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.\nA rightwards shift in Brazil\u2019s government would fit a pattern seen recently in other Latin American states, notably with the election last November of President Mauricio Macri, a free-market reformer, in Argentina and the gradual collapse of the far-left regime in Venezuela, even if for now President Nicolas Maduro still clings to power.\u00a0\nBrazil\u2019s boom times, driven by high commodity prices, had already begun to fizzle by the time of the 2014 re-election campaign. Ms Rousseff is specifically accused of plundering public banks for money that was then used to disguise the national deficit. She has countered that the tactic had been used by previous presidents and that she is in fact the victim of a political \u201ccoup\u201d.\nShe displayed continuing defiance on Tuesday after it became clear that there would be no more delaying the Senate vote. \u201cI will not resign, that never crossed my mind,\u201d Rousseff said in a speech to cheering supporters.\nMr Temer appeared to be moving swiftly to assemble this own team. \u00a0He is known to have picked former central bank chief Henrique Meirelles as Finance Minister and, according to local press report, Itau Unibanco's chief economist Ilan Goldfajn as head of Brazil\u2019s central bank.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "It seemed almost\u00a0\nUsing Google Earth and a home computer, a 15-year-old schoolboy discovered the remains of a long-lost Mayan City.\u00a0\nWilliam Gadoury, from Quebec, Canada, compared maps of 22 star constellations known to the ancient Maya with Google Earth images of Mexico\u2019s Yucatan peninsula.\nHe found the positioning of 117 known Mayan cities corresponded to the patterns of the constellations, with the biggest cities matching up with the brightest stars \u2013 a link no-one else had made before.\nThen he went even further and investigated a little-known 23rd Mayan constellation. Lo and behold, using satellite images he found on the web and photographs sent to him by the Canadian space agency, William found what looked like the remains of a Mayan city, right where the constellation suggested it would be.\nExperienced scientists spoke in wonderment of signs that the Mexican jungle might be hiding what had once been an 86-metre (282ft) high pyramid and about 30 buildings, making the city \u2013 named K'aak Chi (Mouth of Fire) by William \u2013 one of the five largest known Mayan conurbations.\nA Canadian newspaper declared William \u201cthe little star of Nasa, the Canadian space agency and the Japanese space agency.\u201d \u00a0William spoke of being \u201creally excited.\u201d\nThere was just one problem.\u00a0Some archaeologists and anthropologists have started saying it\nThat square seen in the satellite images, they said, the one where the giant pyramid is supposed to be: it\u2019s probably just an old cornfield.\nPerhaps the most outspoken of the critics was David Stuart, professor of Mesoamerican Art and Writing at the University of Texas at Austin.\nIn a tetchy post on his Facebook page, he wrote: \u201cThe current news story is false.\u00a0I was trying to ignore it (and the media inquiries I\u2019ve been getting) but now I feel I ought to say something.\n\u201cThe whole thing is a mess \u2013 a terrible example of junk science hitting the internet in free-fall.\n\u201cThe ancient Maya didn\u2019t plot their ancient cities according to constellations. Seeing such patterns is a Rorschach process, [ie like the psychological test where people are asked to look at ink blots and say what they see], since sites are everywhere, and so are stars.\n\u201cThe square feature found on Google Earth is man-made, but it\u2019s an old fallow cornfield, or milpa.\u201d\nIn follow-up posts, he added: \u201cI don't want to critique the young man mentioned in the story. He's clearly smart and enthusiastic about archaeology and the Maya.\u00a0What steams me most here is the irresponsibility of 'experts'\u00a0who sought the media exposure.\n\u201cI'm interested in how this story appeals to the old trope of the 'Maya-as-special-stargazers'\u00a0-\u00a0something I've been battling for a little while. Not long ago it was fashionable to interpret Maya iconography using star maps, so here we go again...\u201d\nProf Stuart was backed by Thomas Garrison, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Southern California, who told Gizmodo: \u201cI applaud the young kid\u2019s effort.\u00a0However \u2026 in this case, the rectilinear nature of the feature and the secondary vegetation growing back within it are clear signs of a relic milpa. I\u2019d guess it\u2019s been fallow for 10-15 years. This is obvious to anyone that has spent any time at all in the Maya lowlands.\u201d\nProfessor Ivan \u0160prajc, a Slovenian archaeologist with a track record of hacking through the Yucatan jungle to discover Mayan cities, also doubted the discovery, and the idea\u00a0the Maya located their cities according to the stars.\nThe Maya were very good astronomers, he said, but \u201cvery few Maya constellations have been identified, and even in these cases we do not know how many and which stars exactly composed each constellation.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is thus impossible to check whether there is any correspondence between the stars and the location of Maya cities. In general, since we know of several environmental facts that influenced the location of Maya settlements, the idea correlating them with stars is utterly unlikely.\u201d\nBut one Canadian expert who initially backed William\u2019s discovery offered a spirited defence of the original findings.\nDr Armand LaRocque, of the Remote Sensing Laboratory at the University of New Brunswick, said the sceptics had been analysing the wrong photo, after it appeared on several websites including The Independent\u2019s.\u00a0The Independent was sent the original\u00a0image by someone who helped William with his research.\u00a0It later emerged\u00a0this photograph was indeed analysed by William - but he\u00a0deemed no conclusions could be drawn from it.\nInstead William based his discovery on a different set of images.\u00a0Dr LaRocque has now supplied The Independent with one of these photographs and added: \u201cWe also have other images showing lineaments that we interpreted as a road network.\u201d\nEveryone, at least, does seem agreed that the best way to find out whether the satellite images show a cornfield or a long lost Mayan city, is to go into the jungle and check.\u00a0That, though, would be \u2013 in Dr LaRocque\u2019s words \u2013 \u201chorribly expensive.\u201d\nAnd, for the moment, William himself is too busy either to comment on the controversy or to go into the Mexican jungle.\nEnquiries sent to his email address prompted\u00a0an automated reply saying he had to concentrate\u00a0on his exams in the coming days and would then be spending a week at a science exhibition.\nGiven the teenager's apparent enthusiasm for the subject, it can only be hoped he one day manages to investigate the\u00a0findings on the ground himself.", "US officials have determined that an explosion at a Texas fertiliserplant\u00a0was caused by arson.\u00a0\nSpecial Agent in Charge Rob Elder said the bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco interviewed more than 400 people in determining the cause of the April 2013 blast in the small town of West - population 2,800.

In some cases, according to the group, the reality is so oppressive that workers \u201curinate and defecate while standing on the line\u201d and \u201cwear diapers to work.\u201d In others, employees say they avoid drinking liquids for long periods and endure considerable pain in order to keep their jobs.\nThe findings are the result of hundreds of interviews with line workers from some of the largest poultry processing companies in the United States, including Tyson Foods and Perdue. And they bring the current state of the poultry industry into serious question. Competitive forces, they suggest, are driving poultry processors to produce as much meat as possible, as fast as possible, leading companies to mistreat their workers, even if unknowingly.\nToday, poultry processing plants are allowed to funnel chickens through their assembly lines at a rate of 140 birds per minute, a rate which the industry recently lobbied to increase by another 35 birds per minute. The speed has been great for business, but for those working on the line, it has made for extremely taxing shifts. Just ask Debbie Berkowitz, a senior fellow at the National Employment Law Project who used to work with the government agency that oversaw industry practices. On Wednesday, she published a piece in response to the new report. This is how she described the conditions:\nIn my work at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, I witnessed the dangers: poultry workers stand shoulder to shoulder on both sides of long conveyor belts, most using scissors or knives, in cold, damp, loud conditions, making the same forceful movements thousands upon thousands of times a day, as they skin, pull, cut, debone and pack the chickens. The typical plant processes 180,000 birds a day. A typical worker handles 40 birds a minute.\nBy law, companies are required to grant their employees access to bathrooms. A set of standards, written by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1998, makes clear that facilities must be available to employees upon need. In response, the industry has instituted a system, whereby extra workers are available to swap in in the case someone has to leave the line to use the restroom, a system which the government supports so long as \u201cthere are sufficient relief workers to assure that employees need not wait an unreasonably long time to use the bathroom.\u201d\nBut the system is either flawed or being eschewed by supervisors, according to Oxfam. Workers reported waiting for more than an hour for someone to swap in, if anyone came at all. Many of them said they were forced to urinate or defecate where they stood or leave the line without permission, because no help arrived. At some plants, workers have come to expect no relief, leading them to take embarrassing measures to withstand the conditions.\n\u201cI had to wear Pampers. I and many, many others had to wear Pampers,\u201d one worker told Oxfam, an admission the organisation found to be surprisingly common.\nThe industry has responded with both concern and denial. Oxfam says it reached out to all of the companies mentioned in the report, but only heard back from two: Tyson Foods and Perdue. Both said they don't tolerate the sort of practices mentioned in the report, and cited steps they have taken to make sure working conditions at their processing plants are safe and humane. But only one, Tyson, acknowledged the possibility that there were slip-ups happening under their watch.\nGary Mickelson, the senior director of public relations for Tyson Foods, expressed consternation in a follow up e-mail about the report. \u201cWe're concerned about these anonymous claims and while we currently have no evidence they're true, are checking to make sure our position on restroom breaks is being followed and our Team Members' needs are being met.\u201d\nMickelson said he has met with officials of Oxfam America in the past to talk about their concerns. \u201cWe\u2019ve told them that while we believe we\u2019re a caring, responsible company, we\u2019re always willing to consider ways we can do better,\u201d he said in an e-mail. \u201cWe do not tolerate the refusal of requests to use the restroom.\u201d\nPerdue, on the other hand, didn't leave open the possibility that its workers were being subjected to the conditions cited in the report. Julie DeYoung, a company spokesperson, said an internal revenue failed to corroborate Oxfam's findings, citing the company's policy, which allows line workers to take two 30-minute bathroom breaks over the course of an eight hour shift.\n\u201cIf a department is short-staffed that day, there may be times it is difficult to provide immediate coverage,\u201d DeYoung said in an e-mail. \u201cIf an associate has a health or other reason why they need more frequent restroom breaks, they can visit the onsite Wellness Center for support services or talk with Human Resources to request an accommodation for their condition.\u201d\nThe concerns raised in the Oxfam report are the latest in a string of evidence that suggests those who work to ensure that chicken is both widely and cheaply available endure harsh treatment and face grueling conditions. A 2013 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that nearly 80 per cent of 266 workers surveyed in Alabama said they were not allowed to use the bathroom when they needed to. Another report, published just last month, found that 86 percent of workers surveyed in Minnesota said they received fewer than two bathroom breaks each week.\nAsked whether video footage, which is often available in plants, might help to show whether workers were actually being allowed to leave the line to use the bathroom, Mickelson, the Tyson spokesperson, said such monitoring is available in some parts of the company's plants. DeYoung, the Perdue spokesperson, didn't respond to the question.", "A nine-year-old girl is believed to be in \u201cimminent danger\u201d after her uncle bought a bikini, lipstick and underwear and then took her from school.\nInvestigators say Carlie Trent has been missing since 4 May, when her uncle, Gary Simpson, drove her away in his van from her class in\u00a0Rogersville,\u00a0\nAn extensive search operation has been enacted and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) has received more than 1,200 tips but the whereabouts of the child and her uncle remain unknown.\nThe TBI is especially worried by the products Mr Simpson bought in a store he visited around the time of the alleged abduction.

Only days ago, Ms Rousseff had welcomed the Olympic flame to Brasilia. Now she will miss the games entirely.\u00a0\nPreparations \u201chave now entered into a very operational phase and issues such as these have much less influence than at other stages of organising the Olympic Games,\u201c IOC President Thomas Bach said in a statement. \u201dWe have seen the great progress being made in Rio de Janeiro and we remain confident about the success of the Olympic Games in August.\u201d\nThe lopsided nature of the Senate vote suggests Ms Rousseff will struggle to be acquitted at the coming Senate trial, even though a two-thirds majority will be required to impeach and remove her from office permanently.\u00a0Ms Rousseff was the first woman president of Brazil.\u00a0\nFireworks erupted in cities across Brazil at the moment the vote was taken as some in Brazil expressed their glee.\u00a0But supporters of Ms Rousseff, some of whom had briefly clashed with riot police outside the National Congress as the Senate debated her fate, promised additional days or perhaps weeks of political strife with protests and strikes.\u00a0\nOstensibly, the trial of Ms Rousseff will focus only on the charge that she used money from state banks to cover up the depth of the national deficit as she prepared for her re-election in 2014 as the boom in Brazil was already turning into bust. \u00a0\nBut lurking behind the official charges is the widespread malaise over the economy as well as the continuing aftershocks of a massive corruption and kickback scandal involving\u00a0the oil giant Petrobras which\u00a0has ensnared an array of top political figures including many from Ms Rousseff\u2019s own party. On top of all that, Brazil is also enduring the Zika virus crisis.\nMr Temer, 75, barely a popular figure himself, was to take the reins on Thursday and keep the presidency warm pending the outcome of the Senate trial. If Ms Rousseff is found guilty, he would serve out the rest of her second term until the end of 2018 with a first priority of getting the economy in order.\u00a0\n\u201cDid anyone think that we would get to 2018 with a recovery under this government? Impossible,\u201d said Jose Serra, the Social Democratic Party's failed opposition presidential candidate in the 2010 race. \u201cThe impeachment is just the start of the reconstruction.\n\u201cIt is a bitter though necessary medicine,\u201d added Mr Serra, who has been tipped to become foreign minister under Mr Temer. \u201cHaving the Rousseff government continue would be a bigger tragedy. Brazil's situation would be unbearable.\u201d\nA special investigating committee of the Senate will now be created to investigate the charges against Ms Rouseff. When its work is done, perhaps not until late into the year, she and her team will have 20 days to present her defence.\nDue to form\u00a0his own cabinet later on Thursday, Mr Temer is likely move quickly to introduce economic reforms, including deep cuts in public spending and state pensions. \u201cOnly major reforms can keep Brazil from moving from crisis to crisis,\u201d says Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca, an economist and author in Sao Paulo.\nThe country is in its worst recession since the 1930s.

As, perhaps, are your chocolates, sardines and \nWith Interpol recently announcing\u00a0their largest ever seizures of fake\u00a0food and the US government looking\u00a0to clamp down on counterfeit olive oil, examples of food fraud are everywhere.\nNumerous studies have found almost 80 per cent of olive oil in the US is fake. Now, American politicians have now called for tests on all imports of the product, citing health and trading standards concerns.\nA US House of Representatives \nOlive oil is commonly marketed as being Italian, but is often grown elsewhere and is sometimes just packaged in Italy, allowing it to use the phrase \u2018Bottled in Italy\u2019 on its labels. There is also concern that some products claiming to be olive oil are coloured, mixed with chemicals or blended with other types of oil before being sold.\nProducers have been worried over the rising price of the product since \nThe concerns of the paper\u00a0also went beyond consumer rights. It continued: \u201cSome products labelled as olive oil may contain seed oil, which poses a serious health risk to consumers who are allergic to seed oil.\u201d\nThe report then directed the Food and Drug Administration to \u201cto take a sampling of imported olive oil to determine if it is adulterated or misbranded.\u201d\nBut olive oil is far from the only food product to be mis-sold to consumers. Earlier this year, Interpol and Europol made some of the biggest ever seizures of fake food in a sweeping operation in 57\u00a0countries across the world. \u00a0\nIn Italy, officers found 85 tonnes of olives which had been doused in copper sulphate solutions to enhance their colour. I\nFalse labelling also proved to be a major concern for the authorities and was found to affect products globally.

This posed a significant public health risk --\u00a0peanuts can induce anaphylactic shock, potentially lethal to people allergic to them.\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s not just food. In the UK, nearly 10,000 litres of fake or adulterated alcohol including wine, whisky and vodka were found by officers. Counterfeit alcohol has continued to be sold to pubs.

First, few observers were prepared for the tea party movement, which ousted several veteran GOP \u00a0lawmakers, replaced them with more radically conservative newcomers, and helped the Republican Party win control of the House of Representatives in 2010.\n\"That left a lot of analysts slack-jawed, wondering: What was this latent force that drove the emergence of this movement?\" said Robb Willer, a sociologist at Stanford University.\nThen, of course, there was Donald Trump.\nWiller speculates that one thing connecting these two political earthquakes might be white voters' unconscious racial biases. In a series of psychological experiments between 2011 and 2015, he showed how hostility toward people with darker skin and perceived racial threats can influence white support for the tea party. He and his colleagues published a draft of a \nFirst, the researchers randomly sorted subjects into two groups and showed them a series of pictures of celebrities, including digitally altered images of the commander in chief. One group saw a version in which Obama's skin had been lightened, while in the other version, his skin had been darkened.\n(Courtesy of Robb Willer)\nThen the researchers asked the subjects in each group whether they supported the tea party. The share that did was a small minority in both groups. Among the 255 white subjects, though, those in the group that had seen the darkened portrait were almost twice as likely to say they supported the movement.\nAmong the 101 participants of other races or ethnicities, by contrast, those who saw the lightened image of Obama were twice as likely to support the tea party as those who saw the darkened image. Because they had fewer subjects of color, Willer and his colleagues couldn't rule out the possibility that this difference between the randomly assorted groups was due to chance.\nThe result suggests that some white Americans are more likely to oppose Obama solely because of the shade of his skin. For them, the reality that someone with a dark complexion occupies the nation's highest office could be a source of unease.\nPast polls and experiments have also suggested that the president's race has motivated opposition to his policies.\nFor example, psychologist David Sears and political scientist Michael Tesler found that many white voters were willing to support white liberal politicians such as President Clinton and Secretary of State John Kerry when they were candidates for president, but voted against Obama. Since Clinton, Kerry and Obama all espoused a similar ideology, the pair surmised that Obama must have been less popular because he is black.\nConservative politicians also seemed to respond to racial animosity toward the president. A study last year found that -- intentionally or not -- some negative \u00a0advertisements aired against Obama in 2008 showed him with darker skin.\nWiller, though, was able to demonstrate the connection between Obama's skin color and conservative opposition experimentally. The researchers also conducted a few more studies to see whether tea party support might be motivated by signs that the position of white Americans as a privileged majority is declining.\nThe researchers presented two groups of subjects with apparently innocuous reports about U.S. demographic trends and the white share of the population. One group read a report that showed population data only from 2000 to 2020, making it appear that the white majority remains relatively stable. The other group read a report that showed the trend since 1960 and predictions through 2060, forecasting that the white population would decline into a minority.\nAgain, there were significantly greater levels of white support for the tea party among those who read the second report, which focused on the declining white \u00a0population. Those who read that report rated their level of support for the tea party at an average of 1.62 points on a five-point scale, where a score of 5 signified \"a great deal\" of support.\nThose who read the first report, showing that the white majority was relatively stable, rated their support at an average of 1.28 points. Again, supporters of the tea party were in the minority in both groups.\nWiller and his collaborators repeated the experiment, this time with fictional economic data. In one report, the incomes of ethnic minorities were in decline, while white incomes were unchanged. In the second report, white incomes were declining while other groups' incomes did not change.\nIn fact, incomes for all racial and ethnic groups have \nYet Willer had a hunch that because white incomes have declined, some of the white participants in the experiment might feel that white households are losing their relative advantage in the U.S. economy. If so, the second report he showed them would have seemed to corroborate this mistaken perception.\nPrevious research has shown that white Americans tend to see the trend toward racial equity as a \nWith the second report, Willer and his colleagues showed that their subjects reinforced this unconscious bias and produced greater levels of white support for the tea party: Those who saw that report rated their support for the tea party at an average of 1.45 points. Those who saw the first report, showing incomes for racial minorities declining, rated their support at an average of 1.23 points.\nThis kind of zero-sum thinking doesn't seem common among racial minorities. If it were, then one would expect that minorities who read the first report -- showing their disadvantage increasing -- would be more likely to oppose the tea party as a protest against white privileges.\nOn the contrary, participants of color who saw the report that emphasized declining white economic status were more likely to oppose the tea party. Again, this difference might have been the product of random chance.\nWiller started this series of experiments in 2011. He was already wrapping up the research when Trump announced his presidential campaign by calling Mexican immigrants criminals, so he doesn't have direct evidence on whether racial biases have contributed to Trump's success. Yet other research, including polling by The Washington Post, suggests that some white voters' perception that their dominance as a racial group is threatened has motivated some to cast ballots for the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\"A lot of analysts have been shocked to see a major party candidate receive so much popular support despite a track record of controversial statements toward multiple ethnic groups,\" Willer said. \"It's less surprising if you think of the tea party as a sort of historical bridge to the Trump candidacy.\"\nThe movement, he explained, might have made using the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that Trump has employed more socially acceptable, and past research suggests that the movement could have created a new sense of racial identity among its supporters.\n\u00a0\nWCopyright: Washington Post", "A woman who was shot dead in a domestic dispute recorded the sound of her own killing using her mobile phone, police have said.\nWesley Webb, from Pennsylvania, activated an audio recording programme on her phone just before her death, capturing the events of the shooting on 2 May at the home she shared with her partner in Phoenixville, near Philadelphia.\nAccording to police, the sound of a gunshot can be heard on the recording followed by a man\u2019s voice understood to be the 40-year-old\u2019s partner Keith Robert Smith.\nAfter the shot, Smith can be heard yelling, \u201cF*** you!

This is effectively an agreement between the BBC and Government that will determine how the corporation is run over the next 11 years. It is not an agreement about the \nThe White Paper will be debated in both the House of Commons and House of Lords but, but in order to avoid Parliamentary interference, is will not subject to a vote.\nNot really. The BBC\u2019s Director General Tony Hall has been \nMr Whittingdale has said the charter renewal process is looking at whether the broadcaster should continue to be \u201call things to all people\u201d or should have a more \u201cprecisely targeted\u201d mission in terms of its output.\u00a0\nBut any move to prevent the BBC from actively trying to produce \u2018hit\u2019 programmes is being fiercely resisted by Lord Hall and many others inside and outside the Corporation who fear it is part of a right wing Tory agenda to make the it less relevant to public life and in the long run make it easier to dismantle the licence fee without a public backlash.\nThe BBC\u2019s rivals accuse it of deliberately scheduling popular programmes against those being out by other commercial broadcasters, which it denies.\u00a0\nMr Whittingdale was thought to be sympathetic to the idea of forcing the BBC not go head to head with commercial broadcasters with high profile programmes like \nBut after this proposal was leaked to the press the Department of Culture Media and Sport denied that it had any plans to try and control BBC scheduling.\u00a0\nIn a statement it said: \u201cThe secretary of state has made it clear on a number of occasions that the government cannot and indeed should not, determine either the content or scheduling of programmes.\u201d\nCurrently, 50 per cent of BBC programmes must be in-house productions, while 25 per cent must go to independent producers. The other 25 per cent is open to competitive bidding, with both BBC and independent production companies eligible to apply under a system known as the \u201cwindow of creative competition\u201d.\nA senior Government source told The Independent that the White Paper would set out plans \u201cfor the window to be opened much wider\u201d, with \u201cup to 100 per cent\u201d of programming put out to tender, although some exceptions are likely.\nLast time, charter renewal was used to reform the BBC\u2019s governance: the Board of Governors, widely seen as discredited, was replaced with the present BBC Trust.\u00a0\nBut since then the Trust in turn has since been criticised for its dual role as both \u201ccheerleader\u201d and \u201cregulator\u201d and will almost certainly be scrapped.\nWhat is likely to take it place is a BBC board made up of executives and a majority of non-executive directors who will be responsible for the overall running of the Corporation.\nAbove that Ofcom, which already regulates commercial broadcasting, may be asked to regulate the BBC as well. Another option would be to create a Public Service Broadcasting Commission empowered to hold the Corporation to account and investigate complaints.\nThe big dispute here between the BBC and the Government is who should appoint the non-executive directors of the BBC Board. Ministers are keen to take this power for themselves \u2013 but the BBC sees this as dangerous political interference and wants it to be done by an independent appointments commission. Who has won should be clear in the White Paper.\nThe National Audit Office already carries out roughly two investigations into the BBC a year. But under the government\u2019s proposals, Parliament\u2019s spending watchdog would be free to carry out as many inspections as it liked without getting permission from the Corporation.\u00a0\nWhile this is relatively uncontroversial some fear it could extend to asking editorial questions, such as whether the BBC gets value for money on its Saturday night entertainment.\nThe NAO denies that it could question the merits of any editorial or creative judgment at the BBC.\nMinisters want the BBC to disclose the pay of all staff earning over \u00a3150,000. The BBC are resisting this because they fear it would put off \u2018talent\u2019 who would not want their salaries disclosed in the public arena. This is another area where it unclear who has won.\nThe BBC has already indicated it will reduce some of its online content while also funding the coverage of local councils and courts and providing that content to local newspapers and websites.\u00a0\nRecipes and magazine-type features not related to specific programmes are likely to disappear from the BBC website. Other news organisations claim that they represent unnecessary competition.", "No\u00a0one will be able to legally watch the BBC on iPlayer without buying a television\u00a0licence, the Government has announced,\u00a0as part of a new Royal Charter for the Corporation unveiled in Parliament.\nThe move is designed to help the BBC recover the millions of pounds it has lost in revenue by viewers using a legal loophole to watch programmes for free.\nHowever, announcing the change, the Culture Secretary said that in the long run the licence is \"likely to become less sustainable\" and would have to be overhauled entirely.\nAmong other changes to the way in which the BBC will be run over the next eleven years announced today:\nThe BBC will be under a new obligation to provide \"distinctive content\" rather than just chase ratings. This could affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to buy in hit shows from abroad like The Voice.\nThe Corporation will have a new obligation to promote diversity with 15 per cent of lead roles going to black and ethnic minority actors by 2020 and 50 per cent of lead roles going to women.\nOutside production companies will be able to bid to produce all BBC content for the first time - outside the protected areas of news and current affairs programmes.\nThe salaries of all stars paid over \u00a3450,000 will have to be published \u2013 while the BBC\u2019s finances will for the first time be audited by the National Audit Office.\nThe Corporation will now be regulated by Ofcom rather than the BBC Trust. A new board made up of BBC executives and non executive directors appointed by both the Government and the BBC will run the organisation on a day to day basis.\nUnder the deal with the Government the BBC will also fund 150 local journalists to cover local courts and council meetings and providing content to local newspapers and websites.\nUnveiling details of the new Charter the Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told MPs that the BBC \u201cis and must always remain at the very heart of British life\u201d.\n\u201cWe want the\u00a0BBC\u00a0to thrive, to make fantastic programmes for audiences and to act as an engine for growth and creativity,\u201d he said.\n\"Our reforms give the\u00a0BBC\u00a0much greater independence from Government in editorial matters, in its governance, in setting budgets and through a longer charter period.\n\"They secure the funding of the\u00a0BBC\u00a0and will help it develop new funding models for the future.\n\"At the same time, these reforms will assist the\u00a0BBC\u00a0to fulfil its own stated desire to become more distinctive and to better reflect the diverse nature of its audience.\u201d BBC\u00a0Director-General Tony Hall, said: \"This White Paper delivers a mandate for the strong, creative\u00a0BBC\u00a0the public believe in.\n\"There has been a big debate about the future of the\u00a0BBC.

The White Paper reaffirms our mission to inform, educate and entertain all audiences on television, on radio and online.\"\nLord Waheed Alli, founder of the Great BBC campaign, said it was clear that Mr \u00a0Whittingdale had \u201cbeen forced to back down on some of his wilder proposals\u201d but had showed himself to be \u201cideologically committed to undermining the BBC\u201d.\n\u201cWhile this (Charter) may not destroy public service broadcasting immediately, it is only right to warn how this can do real and lasting damage the long term,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is a ticking time bomb under the BBC.\u201d", "The Government has announced a series of recommendations as part of a \"major overhaul\" of how the BBC operates, including the total abolition of the BBC Trust.\nBut beyond the broader issues of governance and accountability, what will the changes mean directly for you as a viewer? Here are the key points from the announcement.\n* A freeze on the fee will end, and the current cost of \u00a3145.50 a year will rise in line with inflation from 2017\n* But there will be more flexible\u00a0payment plans to help lower-income families pay over time\n* And the BBC is going to be required to make its content \"portable\", so UK fee payers can access iPlayer while on holiday in other EU member states\n* The BBC must focus on \"innovative and high quality\" programming - not just on ratings\n* More programmes catering to diverse communities, regions and nations of the UK, as part of a government \"requirement to serve all audiences\"\n* More educational content across BBC platforms \"to help support learning for children and teenagers across the UK\"\n* Fewer \"in-house\" BBC shows, except for news programmes. Because the Tories believe in \"the benefits of competition\", all funding for BBC TV content will be opened up to tender from private production firms who think they could do a better job than the BBC's in-house teams\n* A new complaints system - with Ofcom now taking on responsibility for regulating the BBC\nThere has been much speculation in recent months over what measures would be included in the BBC's new Royal Charter.\nMore controversial moves - such as an attempt to block the BBC from competing with rival broadcasters for prime-time viewers - have not been included.\nIn practice, you may have heard that the changes would stop the BBC running programmes like Strictly Come Dancing at its usual time. That measure has been dropped.\nJohn Whittingdale, the Culture Secretary, told Parliament: \"The\u00a0BBC\u00a0is and must always remain at the very heart of British life.

But unless you are planning on redeeming that title, it is time to get rid of all that clutter.\nBut as the career expert Alyssa Gelbard\u00a0points out: \"Past work experience that might not appear to be directly relevant to the job at hand might show another dimension, depth, ability, or skill that actually is relevant or applicable.\n\"Only include this experience if it really showcases additional skills that can translate to the position you're applying for.\"\nDon't include your marital status, religious preference, or Social Security number (if you're applying for a job in\u00a0America).\nThis might have been the standard in the past, but this information is now illegal or highly discouraged\u00a0for your employer to ask from you, so there's no need to include it.\nNobody cares.\nIf it's not relevant to the job you're applying for, it's a waste of space and a waste of the company's time.\nA CareerBuilder survey asked 2,000 hiring managers for memorable CV mistakes, and blatant lies were a popular choice. One candidate claimed to be the former CEO of the company to which he was applying, another claimed to be a Nobel Prize winner, and one more claimed he attended a college that didn't exist.\nRosemary Haefner, chief human-resources officer at CareerBuilder, says these lies may be \u201cmisguided attempts to compensate for lacking 100 per cent\u00a0of the qualifications specified in the job posting.\u201d\nBut Haefner says candidates should concentrate on the skills they can offer, rather than the skills they can't offer.\n\u201cHiring managers are more forgiving than job seekers may think,\u201d she explains. \u201cAbout 42 per cent\u00a0of employers surveyed said they would consider a candidate who met only three out of five key qualifications for a specific role.\u201d\nIf you don't want to be discriminated against for a position because of your age, it's time to remove your graduation date, says Catherine Jewell, author of \u201cNew R\u00e9sum\u00e9, New Career.\u201d\nAnother surprising way your CV could give away your age: double spaces after a period.\nWhen you use a 0.5-inch margin and eight-point font in an effort to get everything to fit on one page, this is an \u201cepic fail,\u201d says J.T. O'Donnell, a career and workplace expert, founder of career-advice site Careerealism.com, and author of \u201cCareerealism: The Smart Approach to a Satisfying Career.\u201d\nShe recommends lots of white space and no more than a 0.8 margin.\nIf you took time off to travel or raise a family, Gelbard doesn't recommend including that information on your CV. \u201cIn some countries, it is acceptable to include this information, especially travel.\u201d However, in places like the US it is highly discouraged.\nIf your employers want to speak to your references, they'll ask you. Also, it's better if you have a chance to tell your references ahead of time that a future employer might be calling.\nIf you write \u201creferences upon request\u201d at the bottom of your CV, you're merely wasting a valuable line, career coach Eli Amdur says.\nThe format of your CV is just as important as its content, says Amanda Augustine, a career-advice expert.\nShe says the best format is the format that will make it easiest for the hiring manager to scan your CV and still be able to pick out your key qualifications and career goals.\nOnce you pick a format, stick with it. If you write the day, month, and year for one date, then use that same format throughout the rest of the CV.\nYour CV shouldn't include the words \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d \u201cshe,\u201d or \u201cmy,\u201d says Tina Nicolai, executive career coach.\n\u201cDon't write your CV in the third or first person. It's understood that everything on your CV is about you and your experiences.\u201d\nNever describe past work experience using the present tense. Only your current job should be written in the present tense, Gelbard says.\nIf you still use an old email address, like BeerLover123@gmail.com or CuteChick4life@yahoo.com, it's time to pick a new one.\nIt only takes a minute or two, and it's free.\nAmdur says there is no reason to put the word \u201cphone\u201d in front of the actual number.\n\u201cIt's pretty silly. They know it's your phone number.\u201d The same rule applies to email.\nThese fancy embeddings will have hiring managers thinking, \u201cCould you not?\u201d\nWhile a well-formatted header and footer may look professional, and some cool tables, images, or charts may boost your credibility, they also confuse the applicant-tracking systems that companies use nowadays, Augustine tells us.\nThe system will react by scrambling up your CV and spitting out a poorly formatted one that may no longer include your header or charts. Even if you were an ideal candidate for the position, now the hiring manager has no way to contact you for an interview.\nAmdur writes: \"This is not only dangerous; it's stupid. Do you really want employers calling you at work? How are you going to handle that? Oh, and by the way, your current employer can monitor your emails and phone calls. So if you're not in the mood to get fired, or potentially charged with theft of services (really), then leave the business info off.\"\nDon't include your boss' name on your CV unless you're OK with your potential employer contacting him or her. Even then, Gelbard says the only reason your boss' name should be on your CV is if the person is someone noteworthy, and if it would be really impressive.\n\u201cCompanies often have their own internal names for things like customised software, technologies, and processes that are only known within that organization and not by those who work outside of it,\u201d Gelbard says. \u201cBe sure to exclude terms on your CV that are known only to one specific organisation.\u201d\nLinks to your opinionated blogs, Pinterest page, or Instagram account have no business taking up prime CV real estate. \u201cCandidates who tend to think their personal social media sites are valuable are putting themselves at risk of landing in the 'no' pile,\u201d Nicolai says.\n\u201cBut you should list relevant URLs, such as your LinkedIn page or any others that are professional and directly related to the position you are trying to acquire,\u201d she says.\nWhen you start including jobs from before 2001, you start to lose the hiring manager's interest.\nYour most relevant experience should be from the past 15 years, so hiring managers only need to see that, Augustine says.\nOn the same note, never include dates on education and certifications that are older than 15 years.\n\u201cSome people include past hourly rates for jobs they held in university,\u201d Nicolai says. This information is completely unnecessary and may send the wrong message.\nAmy Hoover, president of Talent Zoo, says you also shouldn't address your desired salary in a CV. \u201cThis document is intended to showcase your professional experience and skills. Salary comes later in the interview process.\u201d\n\u201cDon't use Times New Roman and serif fonts, as they're outdated and old-fashioned,\u201d Hoover says. \u201cUse a standard, sans-serif font like Arial.\u201d\nAlso, be aware of the font size, she says. Your goal should be to make it look nice and sleek \u2014 but also easy to read.\nCurly tailed fonts are also a turn-off, according to O'Donnell. \u201cPeople try to make their CVs look classier with a fancy font, but studies show they are harder to read and the recruiter absorbs less about you.\u201d\nCareerBuilder asked 2,201 US hiring managers: \u201cWhat CV terms are the biggest turnoffs?\u201d They cited words and phrases such as, \u201cbest of breed,\u201d \u201cgo-getter,\u201d \u201cthink outside the box,\u201d \u201csynergy,\u201d and \u201cpeople pleaser.\u201d\nTerms employers do like to see on CVs include: \u201cachieved,\u201d \u201cmanaged,\u201d \u201cresolved,\u201d and \u201claunched\u201d \u2014 but only if they're used in moderation.\nCandidates often think, \u201cIf I explain why I left the position on my CV, maybe my chances will improve.\u201d\n\u201cWrong,\u201d Nicolai says. \u201cListing why you left is irrelevant on your CV. It's not the time or place to bring up transitions from one company to the next.\u201d\nUse your interview to address this.\nOnce you're out of school, your grades aren't so relevant\nIf they were particularly high, it's\u00a0OK to leave it. But, if you're more than three years out of school, or if your grades weren't outstanding, ditch it.\nThat's what the cover letter and interviews are for!\u00a0\nYour CV is not the place to start explaining why you'd be a great fit or why you want the job. Your skills and qualifications should be able to do that for you \u2014 and if they don't, then your\u00a0CV is either in bad shape, or this isn't the right job for you.\u00a0\nThis may become the norm at some point in the future, but it's just weird \u2014 and tacky and distracting \u2014 for now.\nDon't try to sell yourself by using all sorts of subjective words to describe yourself, O'Donnell says. \u201cI'm an excellent communicator\u201d or \u201chighly organized and motivated\u201d are opinions of yourself and not necessarily the truth. \u201cRecruiters want facts only. They'll decide if you are those things after they meet you,\u201d she says.\nAvoid including a job on your CV if you only held the position for a short period of time, Gelbard says. You should especially avoid including jobs you were let go from or didn't like.", "Has your boss been complimenting you more frequently? Have they been texting you on the weekend? Do they laugh at every joke you tell \u2014 even the bad ones? If you're nodding to all of the above, then it may because they\u00a0have feelings for you.\n\u201cIt can be difficult to tell whether someone has a crush on you or if they're just being extremely nice, so I caution anyone in this dilemma to tread very carefully, as misinterpreting intentions could be embarrassing for both parties, and even career-damaging,\u201d says Michael Kerr, an international business speaker and author of \u201cThe Humor Advantage.\u201d\nBut you should look for the signs that it may be a full-on crush \u201cbecause that could end up having extremely negative implications on your work,\u201d he says, and you'll want to do something about it before things get really awkward.\nHere are 15\u00a0signs that your boss may fancy you:\nIf you're occasionally asked to stay beyond normal business hours and have a legitimate joint project to work on, that's one thing, says Taylor.\n\u201cBut if you start seeing a pattern of being singled out, and the meetings are always running late \u2014 or there are too many unnecessary private meetings \u2014 then your boss may be trying to go beyond a professional scope,\u201d she says.\nKeep in mind that if you're uncomfortable with these actions and you continue to comply with these requests, things will get worse.\nMost managers have a heavy workload, so when they take the time just to call you randomly without a real reason to talk, then it can be a sign that they are thinking about you a bit more than they should be, says Kerr.\nCheck their body language and eye contact. If you catch them stealing glances at you often or sustaining eye contact longer than is comfortable for you, then this could be a sign, says Kerr.\nYes, it could be simply because they respect you and trust your abilities, but if it crosses over into clear favoritism \u2014 for example, they offer you opportunities that you know in your heart you don't deserve \u2014 then it might be a sign then they like you a little too much, Kerr says.\nTaylor agrees: \"Love struck bosses may give you better projects; more mentoring time than your peers; take you to more lunches; offer you more flexible hours or other perks; be lax about your mistakes; or give you other special treatment.

Well, unfortunately, favoritism in the workplace may not only lead to a disgruntled staff \u2014 it can result in a hostile work environment claim by other employees, and may lead to a court case.\"\nDoes your boss share work and personal confidences with you that you know they wouldn't share with anyone else in your office?\n\u201cYes, they may be doing this because they trust you, but it may also be because they want to deepen the relationship and sharing confidences is a proven way to do that,\u201d says Kerr.\nA boss who has a romantic agenda may intrigue you with a seemingly exaggerated view of your great future at the company, Taylor warns.\n\u201cIt may be difficult to discern if your manager is just as encouraging with everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when your job outlook seems suspiciously rosy, take pause ... and consider all the possible signs to get a realistic sense of their motivations.\u201d\nIt might just be a simple coffee after work, but if this happens in addition to other signs, then this could be a red flag, says Kerr.\nNew outfits, new haircuts, and more attention to detail might be because they're hoping to catch someone's eye at work, Kerr says. And it might be yours.\nAgain, this could just be that they value and trust you as an employee \u2014 but if they ask you for input on personal issues, such as clothing choices, or even dating issues, then this might be a sign.\n\u201cAsking you for advice on their own love life could be totally innocent, but it might also be a ploy to suss out how you really feel about them,\u201d Kerr warns.\nIf compliments are coming your way nonstop but they have nothing to do with work or start to sound inappropriate, then your boss may have more than a friendly affinity for you, Taylor says: \u201cWhile sexual harassment training has exploded over the years, managers can still become lax. So watch for this sign.\u201d\nCompliments about your appearance, fashion sense, or amazing personality are especially strong indicators, adds Kerr: \u201cThrowaway lines such as, 'Anyone would be lucky to have you,' may be signs they have a crush on you.\u201d\nIf these types of comments make you feel uncomfortable, speak to your HR department immediately.\nIf everyone in the company receives a motivational mug on Valentine's Day that says, \u201cWe love our employees\u201d embedded in a big read heart, that's wonderful.

This could help empty your mind and tell your brain it no longer needs to run through your to-do list for the rest of the night.\nThe LED screens of our smartphones give off what is called blue light, which studies have shown can damage vision and suppress production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep cycle.\n\"For me, the key is to every night before I'm going to go to sleep, thirty minutes before, turn off all of my devices and gently escort them out of my bedroom,\" Huffington says.\nThe light given off by your laptop can also prevent your brain from releasing melatonin, and working in bed likely means you're not giving yourself enough time to unwind before sleep.\nWhat's more, working in bed sends the signal that the bedroom is a place for work, not sleep. The more you continue to work in bed, the more your brain associates the bedroom with staying focused and alert.\n\"We think having a nightcap, having a drink, is going to relax us and be like a sedative.

But advocates note that in almost every gaudy princess film or action-packed superhero cartoon, there are relationships -- mums and dads, aunts and uncles, princes and princesses -- that, thus far, have quietly reinforced a very traditional standard for romantic love.\nYet Disney and other giants of children's entertainment have evolved over the decades to reflect changing norms \u2013\u00a0from including characters of many races to ditching the trope of helpless damsels in distress. Could creating a hero with two dads, or giving a princess a girlfriend, be the next step?\nSome Disney fans argued on Twitter that it would have been a huge help for them to see gay characters in movies when they were young \u2013\u00a0that they might have become more sensitive and accepting towards gay peers, or better able to grapple with their own sexuality. Studies have suggested that seeing gay characters in popular entertainment can decrease prejudice towards those groups.\n\"There is no doubt that kids seeing positively portrayed gay characters could have a significant effect that would contribute to such children's learning about the world and who is in it,\" said Edward Schiappa, a professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nBut doing so is a risk for children's entertainment companies, who have a financial incentive to make movies as widely accessible \n\"It can be any little thing that will set off a firestorm,\" said Lori Pearson, lead critic for Kids-In-Mind, a nonpartisan, non-religious group that warns parents of potentially unsavory content in movies. Pearson points to a time in the mid-1990s when a rumour spread that in \n\"Now, especially with the advent of Twitter and places where information can travel quickly, if a certain group decides something in the content is unacceptable, it will spread, and people will decide based on that information not to go see the movie,\" Pearson said. \"And that will ultimately affect the box office.\"\nWhen asked if Disney might include an explicitly gay character in a kids' film, the company responded that its brand \"has always been inclusive, with stories that reflect acceptance and tolerance and celebrate the differences that make our characters uniquely wonderful in their own way. . .

Plus, he noted, the goofy horror story was meant to pay homage to the old \n\"Of course Fred was gay,\" Butler said. \"Anyone who wears white cashmere sweaters and little neckerchiefs is probably not as interested in Daphne as he says he is.\"\nPop culture geeks have long swapped theories about cartoonish characters who maybe-sort-of gave off a gay vibe, including cross-dressing Bugs Bunny, high-pitched-voiced SpongeBob SquarePants and best friends/roommates Ernie and Bert. \"Sesame Street's\" production company was even compelled to put out a statement on the latter topic some years ago: \"They are not gay, they are not straight, they are puppets.\"\nTraditionally in shows meant for kids, even the characters whom their writers intend to be gay almost never came out and said so.

They may look back on their own schooldays and recall exactly how punishing their work schedules were; chances are they were not as exacting as those they are now inflicting on children.\nThe danger in all this is that all these bungles and acts of sabotage, if that is what they are, will discredit the entire system of testing, which would be a deeply damaging consequence. Education is simply too important a matter to be allowed to fall into chaos as it has recently. Either Ms Morgan gets a grip or she should make\u00a0way for someone who can.", "The announcement of the closure of the two largest refugee camps in Kenya, a temporary home to 600,000 people mostly of Somali origin, presents another refugee crisis for\u00a0governments to solve, albeit one rather further from home than the destruction of the illegal camps housing Syrian and other migrants across the English Channel at Calais.\nThat should not mean it is another case of out of sight, out of mind. The fates of these unfortunate African refugees, who will now find themselves on the move yet again in their lengthy and futile attempt to find security, deserve our assistance just as much as those landing in Europe.\nThe pressing need to find a safe, stable place for those evicted is not the only similarity between the situation in Kenya and that on European soils. Writing in \nSimilar language has been used to describe conditions within the camp known as the Jungle\u00a0at Calais. Kevin Hurley, a Surrey police chief, has described the site as a \u201chiding place\u201d for terrorists seeking to target the UK or Europe. \u201cIf I were a returning jihadi I would smuggle myself into this group,\u201d he remarked.\nThere is, inevitably, a truth to both comments: refugee camps are often desperate places where, with their\u00a0residents pushed to society\u2019s margins, extremist and even terrorist sympathies can flourish. But these camps are also home to families fleeing war and persecution, and to children caught up in conflicts of which they bear no responsibility yet much of the pain and suffering.\nThe rhetoric around terror and refugee camps helped the UK Government to defend the indefensible, in turning away Syrian child migrants who should be sheltered and protected by Britain. That decision has happily been reviewed.\nLinking refugee status to terrorism is a dangerous and unfair linguistic shorthand which allows the government and citizens to brush over their responsibilities to the lost and the vulnerable. It must be resisted, and exposed wherever it\u00a0still happens. Kenya may have valid reasons to close its two largest refugee camps; the spurious inference that the 600,000 desperate individuals who live in them are dangerous criminals is not one.\u00a0", "Had he bribed the British media, a famously punctilious body of men and women, David Cameron could not have hoped for a higher profile for his anti-corruption summit. As it was, all he needed was some cheap talk at a reception for the Queen \u2013\u00a0plus a gag about Nigerians from the Commons Speaker John Bercow \u2013\u00a0to push corruption in developing countries to the top of the agenda. Although accidental, it is a remarkable achievement.\u00a0\n\u201cFantastically corrupt\u201d Nigeria and Afghanistan may have been, but Mr Cameron has attempted to repair the diplomatic damage. He has now put his serious face on and acknowledged the scale of the problems, recognised how difficult it is to limit corruption in poorer nations with sometimes vast inequalities in wealth, and the hard work these governments have been doing to try and make their people\u2019s lives less reliant on bent officials and crooked businesspeople. The Prime Minister\u00a0now wants to shout from the rooftops that Presidents Buhari of Nigeria and\u00a0Ghani of Afghanistan are \u201c battling\u201d corruption and taking \"remarkable steps forward\".\nSo the Prime Minister\u2019s gaffe \u2013\u00a0there is no evidence they were part of some sophisticated, if misguided,\u00a0exercise in media management \u2013 have not yet overshadowed his anti-corruption summit. But the diplomatic arguments, and the involvement of the Queen, has certainly obscured some of the important issues.\nFor there is an easy assumption made, plainly there in the small talk at Buckingham Palace, that in such countries corruption is a way of life, a normal way of doing business and, indeed, one that is dignified by long years of greasing palms.\nThere has long been an over-easy assumption among arms exporters,\u00a0for example, that if they don\u2019t offer kickbacks to officials in the procurement game, then the French \u2013 or nowadays, perhaps, the Chinese \u2013 will do it anyway.\nMuch of that culture has changed in recent times as awareness has grown of the damage corruption does to poorer nations \u2013\u00a0and, of course, the poorer populations within those countries. Every pound, dollar or euro that is expropriated illegally is one that could be spent on development:\u00a0on improving educational and health opportunities, or raising productivity in new industries and on farms. That is why corruption is the worst form of theft \u2013 the poorest of the poor are robbed by the very people who oppress them and abuse power, in a process which subverts the democratic process altogether. Cameron is right to say this culture\u00a0must be tackled wherever it is found.\nWestern companies are also\u00a0increasingly aware of their moral and, more to the point, legal obligations under recent anti-corruption legislation. Some high-profile prosecutions have already been brought.\u00a0No longer can slush funds administered from offshore havens be so easily used to channel funds into the London bank accounts of corrupt princelings, presidents and generals.\nOf course, the recent controversy about such tax havens \u2013 which Mr Cameron\u2019s injudicious comments have, embarrassingly for him, reignited \u2013 reminds us that so many of these offshore territories are British overseas dependencies, over which we have some influence. They are,\u00a0in fact, also centres for money-laundering and other illicit activity, and\u00a0long overdue for reform on many grounds.\nMr Cameron could do much more to counter his damaging words with more concrete actions on tackling corruption where it occurs (ironically enough)\u00a0in Her Majesty\u2019s few remaining colonies.", "In recent weeks, as John Whittingdale prepared his white paper on the BBC\u2019s charter renewal, the corporation\u2019s supporters and defenders have been out in force. It has been made abundantly clear to the secretary of state that attempts to reduce the Beeb\u2019s influence, brilliance and independence would be fiercely opposed. The\nPerhaps these efforts help to explain why the white paper, when it was finally published, did not contain some of the more extreme measures on which speculation had focused. The license fee will not be \u2018top-sliced\u2019 after all, for instance, and high-earning stars won\u2019t have to reveal precise details of their remuneration packages.\nStill, the proposals contained in the white paper are not without significance. In particular, Whittingdale has sought to reposition the BBC\u2019s core purpose \u2013 with a greater focus on providing \u2018distinctive\u2019 programming. He has been keen to emphasise that he is \u201cemphatically not saying the BBC should not be popular\u201d \u2013 though that in itself is not quite the same thing as \u201csaying emphatically the BBC should be popular\u201d. Moreover, while the idea of the Beeb being distinctive sounds reasonable enough, to suggest it is something new highlights the degree to which the secretary of state and others in government fail really to understand what the corporation means to the British public.\nWhittingdale illustrated his point by saying that commissioning editors should ask of new programming whether it is \u201csufficiently innovative and high quality\u201d. Yet by placing innovation first, he has shown his hand \u2013 what he wants is for the BBC to avoid showcasing what might be called \u2018derivative\u2019 programmes. Shows such as \nThe other most notable aspect of the white paper is the proposal it makes vis-\u00e0-vis the BBC\u2019s regulation and oversight. It comes as no surprise that the BBC Trust is to be disbanded and few have argued for its retention. The blurring of its regulatory function and its corporate governance role had been criticised even by its current chair, Rona Fairhead, and had been underlined by recent scandals, including the Jimmy Savile affair. Ofcom already regulates the rest of the broadcast arena \u2013 including some elements of BBC activity \u2013 so it makes sense for it to take on additional responsibility for monitoring BBC standards and handling complaints regarding output.\nPlans for a unitary board to replace the Trust and to be responsible for the BBC\u2019s governance will cause division because of the government\u2019s role in appointing around half its members. It will be vital, should the proposals be passed, that appointment processes are transparent and effective: whoever finds themselves on the board will be under close scrutiny and will have to go out of their way to prove their independence from government.\nThe disbandment of the Trust speaks to the government\u2019s primary motive in all this \u2013 or at least the primary motive it would admit to: increased transparency. In this endeavour at least, Whittingdale is right to act. The opaque way in which executive pay-offs were handled in the recent past shone a light on the need for change. By requiring that stars paid over \u00a3450,000 a year be named, if not shamed, the white paper responds to one of the few gripes that members of the public might have about the BBC \u2013 that it isn\u2019t always clear where the licence fee goes.\nRetaining the licence fee as the primary means of funding the BBC is sensible, though Whittingdale may be correct to suppose that rapid changes to the broader media landscape may make it less tenable in years to come. For now though, most people are content to pay up \u2013 and the closure of the loophole which previously allowed iPlayer-only viewers to avoid the fee is entirely appropriate in that context.\nIn one further area too there is merit to the white paper\u2019s proposals \u2013 and that is where it demands more programming for groups currently \u2018under-served\u2019 by the BBC\u2019s output. There is a chance here for particular innovation, although niche programming must not come at the expense of broader appeal.\nAfter all, it is ultimately the quality of so much BBC content that ensures it retains the public\u2019s support and trust. And perhaps above all it is in that bond of trust between public and broadcaster that the BBC\u2019s true distinctiveness lies. No wonder some politicians struggle to see it: bonds and trusts to them mean something entirely different.", "What has happened to the vibrant emerging economy that put the \u2018B\u2019 into BRICS? Once one of the fastest growing and most attractive of markets for overseas investors, full of promise and potential, Brazil seems now unable to host the Rio Olympics, combat the Zika virus or even to govern itself.\nWhile the hype of the 2000s may have been overdone, and some of today\u2019s gloom may be contrived, it has been quite a switchback \u2013 one of the most violent downturns in global economic history.\nOf course the deepest recession in many decades has not been caused by the current political crisis, but it has not helped.\nThe temporary fix now secured \u2013 the appointment of an interim president to serve during the impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff, who has been suspended by the Senate \u2013 has done little to provide stability.\nThe uncertainty about Brazil\u2019s future direction will probably drag on, another wasted opportunity to repair the economy and start to reduce the vast inequalities in wealth that have long scarred Brazilian society.\nSo the world must hope for the best from interim President Temer. For most of the past decade and a half, and especially during the Great Recession, the BRICs provided the bulk (and sometimes the sole part) of global economic growth. Often seen as more threat than opportunity, Brazil, Russia, India and China have, for different reasons, all stumbled in recent years, with only India now displaying anything like its former robustness.\nInflation, unemployment and broken public finances are the principal problems of Brazil, exacerbated by political instabilities and corruption but fundamentally the result of unbalanced growth and an over reliance eon natural resources \u2013 a sector, once booming, now stagnant or worse.\nThus some of the problems facing Brazil are beyond the control of any government. What they can begin to restore is faith in the nation\u2019s public finances \u2013 though as the west has found balancing that with supporting growth is a difficult exercise.\nAs in the rest of the world, too, monetary policy can be used to underpin an economy facing strain as taxes rise, public spending is cut and deficits reduced. In Brazil\u2019s case, a recent moderation in inflation provides some opportunity for the central bank to print money and cut interest rates.\nPresident Temer has made his priorities clear: a George Osborne style assault on public spending, especially on social security. He may not get his way. The majority of public spending in Brazil is protected by law and can only be amended by Congress, which virtually guarantees stasis.\u00a0\nCivil unrest in the middle of a symbolically important Summer Olympics is more likely than a serious attempt to deal with Brazil\u2019s public debt. Perhaps that is not all bad, though, given that cuts to welfare spending would probably create even more serious unrest.\nMore than anything, President Temer needs luck and the support of a people who at least appreciate the scale of the changes facing their nation. Luck would take the form of rising commodity prices, of which there have been some signs, and a revived world economy, of which the signs have been scant.\nA healthier external environment would give the new government the headroom to start pushing reforms in labour, liberalising markets generally and easing trade barriers.\nYet such changes can only be achieved with the consent of a confused and belligerent people who still support president Youseff and yearn for a return to the days of President Lula, now accused of obstructing an investigation into corruption at the Petrobras oil giant.\nIn echoes of Peronism, these two figures are actively appealing direct to the Brazilian people and against the will of parliament and the rule of law \u2013 a dangerous game in a country where democracy was only restored 30 years ago.", "Walt Disney World is much more pleasant in November or January than it is in August. And besides enabling families to avoid the scalding summer heat in Florida, an off-season trip also saves a fortune: holiday prices typically double as soon as term ends, which helps to explain why so many school-age British schoolchildren can be found in the Magic Kingdom when they should be in class.\nWhile Michael Gove was Education Secretary, he sought to eradicate such absences from the classroom by introducing a fixed penalty of \u00a360. The unintended consequence was that the fine merely became an extra element in parents\u2019 calculation of the savings to be made. With British Airways asking \u00a3750 for a Gatwick-Geneva return flight next February half-term, keen skiing families can save more than \u00a3400 per person \u2013\u00a0even with that \u00a360 penalty \u2013 by travelling a week later.\nYesterday the High Court ruled that fining parents is a Mickey Mouse solution to a problem that has its roots in the nature of the travel industry and the structure of the academic year.\nThe heavy hand of central government is inadvertently fuelling conflict between parents and schools. Education is about much more than the narrow academic curriculum. Many head teachers recognise the value of expanding children\u2019s horizons, and the importance of family travel as a social good.\u00a0\nSchools should be flexible about time off during term time. In return, they deserve support when they judge whether this freedom is being used properly, or being exploited by parents who place the value of cheap holiday above their child\u2019s education. And the government and the travel industry should re-open the debate about staggered school holidays through the year \u2013 which represents the only sensible long-term solution."], "student/news": ["The debate on free speech has ignited at the University of Bristol after the institution reportedly attempted to censor a controversial short story which was published online by a student.\u00a0\nAccording to Bristol\u2019s student newspaper, \nThe piece, which Beer has since said is fictitious, tells the story of Bristol student, Charlie, who suffers problems of \u201calienation, drug abuse, and the causes of sexual violence.\u201d\nOne excerpt from the story reads: \u201cIt was a textbook case with this girl.

Should I switch to decaf? Do I really need the kids\u2019 cable TV package when I don\u2019t have children? Did I walk 10,000 steps yesterday? Had I removed the fluff from the tumble dryer?\nThere were a few clouds in the Carmarthenshire sky, but otherwise it was an absolutely gorgeous day. A light breeze blew the reeds by the riverbank and ruffled the grass leading up the hill to the imposing ruins of \nThe Welsh sea trout season opened last month and runs through to mid-October. As the name suggests, this species leaves inland rivers to venture out to sea in order to feed before returning to spawn. This oceanic journey exposes the fish to a richer source of food, which makes them substantially bigger than brown trout you\u2019ll find in the same stretch of water. \u00a0\nI was supposed to be night fishing, when the sea trout are at their liveliest, but that had been put on hold due to high river levels. There was talk of undertaking a \u201cfishing safari\u201d, moving between various spots on the River Towy, just outside the pretty town of Llandeilo. However, my companion Tom and I decided not to move around \u2013 were perfectly content here in our idyllic little spot.\nTom is a keen fisherman at home in Wiltshire, along with his young son Adam, but I was a beginner, so the first fly-fishing lesson I received from 42-year\u2013old local ghillie Jamie Harries was how to cast.\u00a0\nWe stood on the edge of a field near the river as he instructed me with a lyrical sing-song lilt on how to cast the rod from 2pm to 10pm on a clock face, and the motion to accompany it was as if I were hammering a nail, rather than flicking my wrist, with arm kept close to my body. Of course Jamie, with years of experience, made it all look effortlessly easy and we chatted as I practised.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why British people spend thousands of pounds and travel thousands of miles to fish somewhere like Argentina, but ignore what they have on their doorstep,\u201d he opined, sweeping his rod before him. \u201cThey want to find that elusive double-figure sea trout, but last year we had around 50 that were over 12lbs, and our biggest was around 19lbs. We get foreigners coming here from all over the world, from Russia, America, Switzerland.\u201d\nOur home for the weekend was the Cawdor Hotel in Llandeilo, with bucolic countryside views from my top-floor bedroom. It was a friendly base from which to explore the small, pretty town, with its Friday morning market, and which seems to be bucking the national trend by holding on to an impressive range of independent shops. We ate at the hotel one evening, then at the Angel Bistro down the road the other, where the food was equally good. Our appetites were somewhat blunted, however, as we made a classic schoolboy error by popping into Heavenly Desserts Emporium on Rhosmaen Street a few hours beforehand. An old Morris Minor parked outside St Teilo\u2019s Church gave the place an air of a Miss Marple mystery, but the only thing getting murdered was my hopes of ever catching a sea trout. \u00a0\nBack on the Towy we moved from field to river to practise fishing with a spinning rod, and then waded in. Fish or no fish, there\u2019s something inherently calming about being in the middle of a river far away from car horns or the beeps and pings of mobile phones and urban life. I moved slowly, practising what I\u2019d been taught, sharing my space with the otter that clung closely to the bank before moving out of view. Dinefwr stood above us on the hill, guarding this part of the Towy as it had done for hundreds of years since it was the seat of power for the Principality of Deheubarth. Long before that, there were Roman forts here.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no magic to this,\u201d said Jamie \u201cyou just need to keep practising. Women and children tend to pick it up quicker than men, I don\u2019t know why. I caught my first sea trout when I was seven.\u201d\u00a0\nAlas there were no fish, but it hardly seemed to matter. We eventually retired to the pub, where a framed timetable for the train from Llandeilo to Swansea suggested the route was only about 10 minutes quicker than it had been 150 years ago. But I wasn\u2019t in any hurry. Time for another pint and maybe an ice cream. The sea trout would still be there tomorrow, just out of my reach again, while I pondered more of life\u2019s big questions.\u00a0\nGolden Grove Fishery (01494 524411, ", "Driving in circles around the Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey after an already long journey, my husband and I briefly cursed ourselves for not printing out instructions for how to get to Polpier House rather than relying on Google maps.\u00a0\nMy 4G had ceased functioning and we briefly wondered how we were every going to find the holiday home we had arranged to share with eight friends and three preschoolers \u2013 including our own \u2013 for the weekend. Happily, a glance upwards from the harbour solved our navigational woes; Polpier, it transpired, sits grandly on a hill overlooking the village, its crenellated roof a striking sight. Once at our destination, we soon discovered that the views back down the hill from this opulent, late 19th-century mansion to the harbour and out to sea are even more unmissable.\u00a0\nPolpier, which sleeps 16 adults, has been expensively but tastefully renovated to offer all mod cons (think underfloor heating and powerful walk-in showers) in addition to Victorian splendour. There are seven rooms in the main house, including one two-bedroom suite, two of which can be configured with twin beds. This being a high-end wedding venue as well as a holiday rental, there is a separate honeymoon suite in the grounds, complete with balcony overlooking the harbour.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s safe to say that nobody in your party is likely to feel short-changed by their sleeping quarters. All the rooms are spacious (some are almost intimidatingly ginormous); all are en suite and come complete with luxurious bedding, towels and toiletries.\u00a0\nNor is anybody likely to feel cramped by day; the living spaces are vast - so big that there\u2019s a DJ booth complete with disco lights in the main hallway - and offer a plethora of options to keep everyone entertained. There\u2019s the snooker room and table tennis; a huge main kitchen/dining room backed up by a well-equipped catering kitchen; two living rooms; three wood-burning fires and several sizeable televisions... and all that\u2019s before you stroll outside to the tennis court, croquet lawn, barbecue, outdoor dining area and, best of all (in warm weather at least), sizeable swimming pool.\u00a0\nA separate 10-bed property within the grounds, Penpol, can be rented on its own or in conjunction with Polpier. Travel cots (and high chairs) are available for smaller guests.\nThere\u2019s not actually a pressing need to leave the grounds while staying at Polpier, given the diversions on hand. If you do get itchy feet, however, its a five minute stroll downhill to Mevagissey, with its pretty harbour, small aquarium, model railway museum, shops and eating options.\u00a0\nFor bigger excursions, the beautiful Lost Gardens of Heligan (heligan.com) are less than three miles away and the Eden Project (eden project.com) is half an hour\u2019s drive. There are several beaches nearby, including at Polstreath and Gorran Haven, and in high season (until 1 October), a passenger ferry plies the scenic route from Mevagissey to the harbour town of Fowey (mevagissey-ferries.co.uk). Outdoor pursuits including golf and cycling can be easily arranged; there\u2019s a pretty comprehensive guest book at Polpier with plenty of details.\u00a0\nFew staples are provided for guests arriving at Polpier - its essentially just tea bags, coffee and sugar - but that\u2019s easy to overlook that when you\u2019re distracted by the gigantic stack of fresh scones sitting in the middle of the breakfast bar. This being Cornwall, there is of course clotted cream and jam to go with; a perfectly indulgent pick-me-up at the end of a long drive.\u00a0\nFor those who cannot live by scone alone, there are sizeable supermarkets 15 minutes\u2019 drive away in St Austell, or you can get an online shop dropped off in advance; housekeeper Amanda will unpack it for you. A local independent grocer/deli, Moores, will deliver meat, baked goods, dairy and deli treats with 24 hours\u2019 notice (01726 843035). On weekdays, in season, Polpier\u2019s gardeners will help you pick fruit, veg and herbs from the house\u2019s own gardens.\nMevagissey is bustling if small, with several restaurants and take-aways to choose from; try Salamander (01726 842254) for locally-sourced fare or the Central Caf\u00e9 (01726 843109) for lip-smacking fish and chips to eat in or take away.

What is indisputable is that here is one of Britain\u2019s most gifted comic actresses putting a none too flattering spotlight not just on her own trials, but on the odd and far too secretive practices of theatre itself.\nThis week she was absent again (twice) from her lead role in \u2018Funny Girl\u2019, a real blow to ticket holders as, let\u2019s be frank, it is Smith that they have paid large sums to see. And she is truly mesmerising in the role. This latest incident follows a curious one a couple of weeks ago when she had to abandon the performance 20 minutes in, and some in the audience were reported in the press as saying she seemed to be swaying, changing accents and acting in a drunken fashion.\nThe theatre management afterwards said the show was actually abandoned because of \u2018technical difficulties\u2019, a ludicrous and highly insulting excuse to the disappointed ticket holders. What technical difficulties exactly? They didn\u2019t have the courtesy to say.\nAnd then a few weeks earlier she refused to go on at all, for the totally justifiable reason\u00a0that she had learned her father was suffering from cancer. But bizarrely she then took to Twitter to complain that the producers were harassing her about this and she might be seeing them in court.\nThat\u2019s quite a little drama to play out on Twitter. But then those of us who follow the 34-year-old star on Twitter weren\u2019t that surprised at drama on her Twitter feed. It has been a roller coaster of emotions, detailing the disappointments in her love life, her thrills at her numerous awards, and once when her purse was snatched in the street her no- holds- barred philosophising about the sort of people who would do that. One suspects that the last incident provoked some acerbic responses about why deprived people and affluent actresses, as she was so hurt by the comments that she left Twitter, a hardship for her that she didn\u2019t continue for very long. And that is possibly because she needs what she honestly refers to as her \u201cTwitter family\u201d. The daily mutual affection and honesty between her and her followers is clearly a source of considerable sustenance to her. And this perky, open and seemingly transparent personality excites great affection in her fans.\nBut before considering this complex character, let\u2019s pay tribute to her talent. We championed Sheridan Smith early in her career here on The Independent, giving her her first cover feature interview, because she showed from her early days astonishing comic ability. One notable example was a show-stealing cameo as James Corden\u2019s mischievous, mouthy sister in \nAnd yet\u2026speak to people in the industry and they are not always so flattering about Sheridan Smith. They will say that perhaps she likes to be out on the town too much, is occasionally seen the worse for wear, and could do with amending her lifestyle. Her defenders would no doubt reply that her prolific track record, work rate, awards and rave reviews, are answer enough. But it is as an admirer rather than detractor of hers that one wishes she would take a long, hard look in the mirror and resolve never to put her enormous talent at risk.\nCertainly there have been missed performances. The public does not always know about them because all actors and actresses ensure they are fit and healthy on press nights. But it would be interesting to see the exact number of performances of, say, \nIt\u2019s almost fatuous to say that a successful, much-loved\u00a0actress has had a difficult life. But we should acknowledge that Smith, whose father has now been diagnosed with cancer, lost her own older brother to cancer when he was 18 and she was eight. When she played train robber Ronnie Biggs\u2019s wife Charmian on TV and learned how they had lost a son at the age of 10, she told an interviewer: \u201cFrom a personal point of view, too, the whole business of the little boy\u2019s death was almost unbearable for me. It hit an awful raw nerve. It made me look at feelings which I thought I\u2019d pushed away a long time ago, but which I realise now were just there, beneath the surface.\u201d\u00a0\nSmith has also in her private life failed to find a secure and loving relationship, and has the strain of enormous expectations and one of the most prolific work rates in the business.\nThere is, too quite a sensitive soul here. When she complains, as she has this week that she is being bullied on social media, we should listen. She takes such things extremely seriously.\nThe answers? Well first of all, theatres must be honest with their audiences. Stop the nonsense about \u2018technical difficulties\u2019 and give audiences (and not least the performer involved) the respect of telling them the truth, always offer full refunds if a star is off \u00a0\u2014 cash not just an alternative performance \u2013 and be honest about how many performances a star misses.\nAs for this particular star, I do not know if she is prone to any addictions, but I do sense that here is someone clearly struggling with problems who needs wise counsel. And I say what I said about Amy Winehouse and numerous others over the years: why don\u2019t they receive the proper care and attention from those people benefitting financially from their talents? Someone should be looking after this massively gifted but somewhat troubled, young woman. Someone should be nurturing her stunning talent properly.", ""], "news/world/europe": ["The French government has resorted to its emergency powers to impose changes in employment law which have provoked violent protest in recent days.\nIn a stinging reverse for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande a year before elections, the government failed to persuade a blocking minority of its own Socialist deputies to support \u00a0plans to simplify and loosen France\u2019s complex rules on hiring and firing.\nDefying increasingly angry street protests by militant unions and students, the government moved to by-pass a parliamentary vote and impose the changes by decree in the next few days.\nThe Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament \u2013 to scattered boos and heckling \u2013 that he had been authorised by a cabinet meeting to use clause 49.3 of the constitution to \u201cengage the government\u2019s responsibility\u201d and push through the changes. Unless the government loses a confidence vote \u2013 which seems unlikely \u2013 the reforms will become law.\n\u201cThe country must move forward,\u201d Mr Valls said. A \u201cbalanced and coherent reform, intended to encourage employers to create jobs, \u201cmust be seen through to the end.\u201d\nThe government had compromised on its original proposals, he pointed out, to the satisfaction of more \u201creformist\u201d unions. Nevertheless, at least 40 government deputies were threatening to block the changes.\nThis is the second time in two years that the Valls government has been forced to use emergency powers to push through market-friendly reforms against the wishes of part of the Socialist parliamentary party.\nDespite substantial concessions made to moderate unions, the changes are the first serious attempt by any recent administration to lighten the regulatory obstacles to job creation in France. The centre-left government insists that less rigid labour laws are in the best interests of young people and the country\u2019s 3,500,000 jobless.\nThe right-wing opposition dismisses the changes as an \u201cempty shell\u201d \u2013 although the proposals go beyond anything attempted by the former president, Nicolas Sarkozy.\nThe reforms will make it easier for employers to terminate long-term contracts when their businesses are struggling. They will permit local agreements between employers and workers to modify the 35 hour working week and other labour regulations.\nHard line union federations say the changes would, in effect, end the principle of a single nationwide body of legal protections for workers. Unions representing only 30 per cent of workers in one factory or office could call for a referendum to approve or reject a local agreement to set aside regulations including some aspects of the 35 hour week.", "\u201cDon\u2019t go to the place where the bombing took place. Go to our tourist places, go to the nice refugee camp,\u201d the deputy governor of Gaziantep requested. \u201cAnyway, our security forces are extraordinarily effective, so the security situation is overall fine, despite what has happened.\u201d\nSitting at the Governor\u2019s Palace, Halil Uyumaz was keen to stress how well Gaziantep was doing. And, indeed, the city and the surrounding region has grown and prospered since we journalists first began to pass through there on the way to cover the Syrian civil war.\nThe trappings of affluence have been acquired via funds from international aid and the arrival of the Ankara government thanks to Gaziantep\u2019s strategic location \u2013 just 30 miles from Syria. But that proximity has also brought deadly violence and refugees; the grim consequences of the bloody strife across the border.\nA suicide bombing at Gaziantep\u2019s heavily guarded central police station, two days before Mr Uyumaz spoke last week, claimed the lives of three policemen and injured 22 others. Two days later residents in the neighbouring town of Kilis took out a newspaper advertisement pleading to the Turkish authorities to provide better security against attacks from Syria. \u201cRockets fall on our houses, shrapnel pieces rain on us, we are being killed in our homes, on the streets,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are citizens of the Turkish Republic, we are not subtitles on a news programme.\u201d\nGaziantep and its hinterland is also the main area for the dispossessed \u2013 around 2.7 million Syrians and 300,000 Iraqis \u2013 that Turkey is hosting and, as such, has come under focus in relation to the European Union refugee agreement. Under the contentious deal, Turkey will take back all the refugees who cross the Aegean Sea to get into Greece, sending, in their place, others who agree to follow legal channels for the journey.\u00a0\nIn return, the EU is giving Ankara billions of euros for refugee welfare, and is supposed to offer visa-free travel for Turkish nationals, as well as hastening the process of Turkey joining the EU.\nTwo weeks ago German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, visited a refugee camp, Nizip, in Gaziantep. Ms Merkel praised Turkey for making the \u201cgreatest contribution\u201d to refugees. Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish Prime Minister, who was accompanying them, made it clear what Ankara really expected of the EU: \u201cThe issue of the visa waiver is vital for Turkey.\u201d\nSince then Mr Davutoglu, who brokered the refugee deal with Ms Merkel, \nThe Turks charge the West with ingratitude over its counter-terrorism role. \u201cWe are the permanent borders of Nato, nobody seems to give us any credit for that,\u201d complained Murat Salim Esenli, under-secretary at the Turkish foreign ministry. \u201cWe are fighting terrorists and this is protecting Europe as well as us.\u201d\nBut there have been accusations that, in the past, the Turks have helped Syrian Islamist rebels, sometimes by facilitating the transport of weapons funded by the Saudis and the Qataris, and this has been a factor in establishing the extremist presence in Gaziantep and other border areas.\nTwo prominent Turkish journalists, Can Dundar, the editor of the centre-left Cumhuriyet newspaper, and its Ankara bureau chief, Erdem Gul, have been jailed for five years for publishing a story about weapons, being sent to Syria by Turkish intelligence, being stopped by Turkish military and police. A gunman opened fire at a press conference being given by the journalists following their sentencing last week, injuring one of their colleagues.\nThe suicide bomber who carried out the attack on the Gaziantep police station was a Turkish member of Isis, Ismail Gunes, according to security forces who carried out 32 arrests following the blast. At the end of last week, the Turkish military announced that in two separate exchanges it had killed three Isis fighters and injured 11 others as they were trying to cross over from Syria, the latest in a rising series of clashes.\nSyrian activists, who led the protests against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and had then been targeted by the hardline jihadists who had taken over the revolution, have discovered that fleeing Syria has not brought escape from its violence. Half a dozen of them have been murdered in Turkey by Isis.\nThe presence of extremists, Turkish and foreign intelligence agencies, and smugglers variously of people, arms, looted historical artefacts, and oil, have made the border towns a place of illicit opportunities and danger.\nI first met Yassir al-Aboud when he was a rebel fighter in Aleppo four years ago fighting under a commander, Hajji Marea, a \u00a0former honey-trader who became leader of the group Liwa al-Tawhid, and died two and half years ago in a Turkish hospital after being injured in a regime air strike in Syria.\nAboud, 36, came to Turkey after being wounded, leaving armed struggle behind because he was disillusioned by infighting among the rebel factions. \u201cThere is good money being made here if one has the right connections, but one must be very careful, people may not be who they seem to be. There are so many Syrians here now it is not difficult for dangerous people, killers even, to move around. I am personally very careful, we have all got enemies,\u201d said Aboud at a caf\u00e9 where the clientele were almost all Syrians.\n\u201cMost of the Syrians will stay here. Some have gone to Europe; that may become difficult for a while now, but, you know, these smugglers always find new routes. There are still lots of camps of course, but how long will they be kept open?\u201d\nThere are around 350,000 Syrians in Gaziantep: around 200,000 of them live outside the camps. Under Turkish law, Syrians cannot total more than 10 per cent of an employer\u2019s workforce and finding employment is not easy. Abdulhamid Khoury, a friend of Aboud, looks after his family of six through casual building work and charity donations. \u201cI haven\u2019t got connections like Yassir, so it\u2019s hard work. There is nothing left over for extras, so it\u2019s hard, but I don\u2019t want to stay in a camp,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are more in control of our lives outside.\u201d\nOne needs the permission of the authorities to go into the camps. I was taken to Nizip, the place where Ms Merkel and Mr Tusk were recent visitors, a complex projected by authorities as very much a showpiece. Comprised largely of containers, it appears to be well run, with schools, shops and basic medical facilities. Two families produced for interviews by officials maintained everything was \u201cexcellent\u201d. They had no intention of going to Europe, they insisted, because things will not be so good there.\u00a0\nBut away from the crowd, Hassan Ismail intimated his plans to go to Germany. \u201cI must keep trying for that. There is nothing left for my family to go back to in Syria, as you know\u201d, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our children growing up in camps, a generation growing up in camps.

countries to Italy, amid fears of a significant increase in the number of people attempting to make the dangerous crossing this summer.\nA House of Lords report said the operation had saved more than 9,000 lives over the last year, but warned it had failed in its wider aim of reducing people smuggling.\nWhile 80 smuggler boats have been destroyed by EU naval forces, the sinkings, which take place after migrants are rescued, had simply resulted in smugglers switching from wooden boats to even more dangerous dinghies, which are \"even more unsafe\",\u00a0the report said.\nIt also found that the people traffickers arrested when boats are seized tended to be low-ranking. While 50 arrests had been made, they were not the key figures in smuggling networks, the report added.\nThe House of Lords EU committee said that bloc had failed to address the roots of migration in countries of origin, adding that Operation Sophia had been hamstrung by the Libyan government\u2019s weak grasp on power.\nOperation Sophia - named after a baby born on a mission ship off the Libyan coast - is currently limited to operating in international waters.\nPlans are being drawn up to extend its remit to Libyan waters and onshore, but the committee said it was doubtful this could succeed, in light of on-going instability.\nLord Tugendhat, chair of the committee said: \u201cA naval mission cannot disrupt the business model of people smuggling, and in this sense it is failing.\n\u201cThe smuggling networks operate from Libya and they extend through Africa.

Only 246 deputies voted for the no confidence motion \u2013 42 fewer than the number needed to bring the government down. \u00a0\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mr Valls decided earlier this week to use their constitutional powers to impose the labour law reforms by decree. Protest marches in Paris and most other larger French cities this afternoon attracted tens of thousands of supporters \u2013 including a fringe of hooded youths who fought running battles with riot police.\nThe hard\u00a0left and anarchist youths also attacked television journalists and scuffled with the stewards deployed by trade\u00a0unions.\nPresident Hollande, facing disastrous poll ratings less than a year before presidential elections, insists that simplification of France\u2019s complex labour laws will create tens of thousands of jobs. In a speech, he said that the reforms would bring a new \u201csuppleness\u201d to labour relations which would be good \u201cfor workers and employers\u201d and bring \u201cprogress\u201d to France.\nHardline trade\u00a0unions and a bloc of traditionalist Socialist politicians \u2013 including several former ministers and the Mayor of \u00a0Paris, Anne Hidalgo \u2013 oppose the changes. So do 70 per cent of French people.\nModerate trade\u00a0union\u00a0federations agreed\u00a0the reforms after the government softened the more radical original proposals. Militant unions detest the fact that the changes would allow factory-by-factory or office-by-office deals between workers and bosses to override national agreements and some aspects of labour law.\nWith elections looming next April and May, the reforms have become a symbol of President Hollande\u2019s switch two years ago towards market-friendly policies which have angered the hard left and traditionalist members of his own Socialist Party.\nThe reforms, though scarcely radical compared to labour laws in other European countries, have provoked a sometimes violent street protest movement in recent weeks. They have been rejected as an \u201cempty shell\u201d by the centre-right opposition \u2013 even though they go beyond anything attempted by successive centre-right governments in France.\nWhen it became clear earlier this week that 50 Socialist deputies would try to block the reforms in the National Assembly, Mr Hollande and Mr Valls resorted to the powers of decree granted by article 49-3 of the constitution of the Fifth Republic.\u00a0Under this article, opponents can only block the reforms if they win a confidence vote against the government.\nA censure motion tabled by the centre-right opposition was defeated\u00a0\u2013 allowing the law to pass through the lower house of parliament. A bloc of 56 Socialist, Communist and Green deputies fell just short of gaining enough support to table their own rival, censure motion last night.\nSuch a deep schism in government ranks is unprecedented in recent French political history. Ministers accused the \u201cfrondeurs\u201d or rebels of a cynically calculated act of disloyalty \u2013 posturing to their hard-left sympathisers while avoiding bringing down the government and risking an early election.\nThe reforms are the first serious attempt by any recent administration to lighten the regulatory obstacles to job creation in France. They will make it easier for employers to terminate long-term contracts if their businesses are struggling. They will permit local\u00a0agreements between employers and workers to modify the 35-hour working week and other labour regulations.\nThe new law also offers new workers\u2019 rights.

By forcing airlines to share information with member states, this \u201cwill enhance our detection capabilities of jihadists' movements\u201d, he said.\nOn 13 November 2015, ten terrorists, operating from Brussels under the command of Islamic State in Syria, attacked three groups of targets in the Paris area. The attacks killed 130 people \u2013 including 90 in the Bataclan concert hall in central Paris.\nSeven of the terrorists were killed or blew \u00a0themselves up on the night. Two, including the presumed leader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were killed in a police assault on their hide-out north of Paris four days later.\nThe tenth suspected attacker, Salah Abdeslam, who failed to carry out a suicide bombing and fled home to Brussels, was arrested by Belgian police in March and extradited to France last month. He is being questioned by French investigators but his trial is unlikely to take place for several years.\nFrench media reports on the progress of the joint French and Belgian investigation into the attacks suggest that many questions remain unanswered.\nLe Figaro reported that investigators believe that there were at least 40 people in Brussels-based terror network which carried out both the Paris and Brussels attacks. Twelve had died and 20 were under arrest, mostly in Belgium but also in France and Austria. This left around eight people unaccounted for.\nAlthough Abdelhamid Abaaoud is believed to have been the \u201coperational leader\u201d on 13 November, the mastermind behind the attacks has yet to be identified.\nFrench investigators are interested in the role of a man code-named \u201cAbou Ahmad\u201d, based in Syria, who is thought to have played a significant role in planning the Paris attacks.\nThe 101 people arrested in France in the last six months, using emergency powers which have been extended until the end of July, were involved directly or indirectly in other jihadist activities. None is believed to have been involved in the Paris or Brussels attacks.\n\u00a0Mr Cazeneuve said on Thursday\u00a0that the emergency powers had also allowed France to refuse to admit 17,500 people suspected of jihadist sympathies.", "It was 9:07 am\u00a0on 22 March\u00a0when Belgian police's directorate of operations sent out an email ordering the closure of the Brussels metro.\nEarlier that morning, about 8 am, there was an explosion at \nBut when police finally sent an email to order that closure, they sent it to the wrong address, a parliamentary committee has learned.\nAt 9:11am, a bomb went off in a metro train that was about to leave Maalbeek station. Sixteen more minutes lapsed before the city's metro system was finally closed. The Isis militant group later asserted responsibility for the attacks.\nAccording to Politico Europe, authorities sent the crucial email to the private account of Jo Decuyper, the head of the city's railway police, rather than to his official address.\n\"At that time, I was obviously not sitting in front of my computer,\" Decuyper was quoted as saying by the Belgian newspaper De Standaard.\nSending emails had become necessary because of disruptions to phone service in and around Brussels after the initial attack. Even authorities had few options apart from communicating via the Internet or smartphone services such as WhatsApp.\nHowever, Decuyper told the parliamentary committee, no email could have prevented the explosion, even if he had seen the order on time.\n\"Even if there was a button to stop everything and to evacuate \u2014 which obviously does not exist \u2014 it would not have prevented\" the blast, Decuyper said.\nHe said that evacuating the metro system under normal circumstances would have taken 30 minutes. Apart from that, federal police ordered the metro to shut down only by noon that day \u2013\u00a0about four hours after the first explosion at the airport had taken place.\nThe information about the email error has raised new questions about whether Belgian authorities are up to the challenge of confronting Islamist terrorism in their country.\nIn an interview with CTC Sentinel magazine in August, Belgian counterterrorism official Alain Grignard openly acknowledged the obstacles authorities were facing.\n\u00a0\n\"We don\u2019t have the same resources as US\u00a0law enforcement agencies, but it\u2019s important to point out you can never provide 100 per cent security,\" he said.

We finished the call and I went back to finish my TV series,\" he said.\nRed Bull announced last week that Verstappen, the rising star of the sport, was moving up from Toro Rosso to replace 22-year-old Kvyat for the remaining 17 races of the season.\nThe decision was seen as harsh, even if it came after the Russian had twice collided in Sochi with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. Kvyat had been on the podium in the preceding race in China.\nThe switch was also interpreted as a move by Red Bull to secure Verstappen for the long term in the face of rising interest from rivals.\nRed Bull principal Christian Horner said the move would allow Kvyat to \"regain his form and show his potential\" in a familiar team but the Russian said he had been given \"no real explanation.\"\n\"If the bosses want something to happen, they just make it happen. It's as simple as that,\" declared Kvyat.\nHe said 'dropped' was too heavy a word for what had happened, saw no reason for it and said he had been feeling no more pressure than usual.\n\"I will try to give as loud an answer as possible on the track,\" Kvyat said of his response.\n\"I am now extremely hungry...there are a lot more positive moments now than anyone can imagine and I take it as a golden opportunity with Toro Rosso.\"", "Danill Kvyat should not look badly on his move to Red Bull\u2019s junior team Toro Rosso because it\u2019s a chance to prove he belongs in the Formula One paddock, says former race winner David Coulthard.\nKvyat heads to this weekend\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona no longer with the Red Bull outfit after the decision was taken to replace him with 18-year-old Max Verstappen \u2013 promoting the Dutchman after an impressive debut season in 2015 \u2013 following a controversial race in Russia where he spun four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel out of the race.\nIn what is perhaps a sign of Kvyat demonstrating his maturity to the Red Bull hierarchy, he has taken the demotion as well as he could have, though his task was not made any easier when he was placed alongside Verstappen in the drivers\u2019 press conference on Thursday. Yet Coulthard believes that 22-year-old Kvyat should seize the opportunity in front of him and prove to Red Bull that they were right to select him when replacing Vettel in 2015.\nAsked if demotion was too harsh a word to describe the scenario, Coulthard told the Independent: \u201cAbsolutely. He\u2019s still a grand prix driver, he\u2019s still a fast grand prix driver and he\u2019s still a lovely bloke. He went straight from GP3 to Formula One, and then straight from Toro Rosso to Red Bull because Sebastian Vettel used a clause in his contract to leave Red Bull early to join Ferrari.\n\u201cThings move quickly in Formula One , you\u2019ve got to get on and perform. Kimi Raikkonen is a world champion but he\u2019s not exactly looking like he\u2019s going to win another one. So Ferrari will have to make the decision at some point that they\u2019re going to replace him with someone else, or he may come out and say \u2018I\u2019ve had my chance\u2019 and move on. It\u2019s a cycle of life, isn\u2019t it?\n\u201cDanill is still very much in the mix and it\u2019s still in his hands to show that he deserves to be in Formula One, and I hope he does. Clearly Red Bull do otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have taken him from one grand prix drive into another, they would have just left him.\u201d\nCoulthard\u2019s admission that the world of Formula One moves quickly can be seen no clearer than Red Bull\u2019s driver line-up. It\u2019s been widely suggested that Daniel Ricciardo, the current No 1 at Red Bull, could follow Vettel to Ferrari next season and replace Raikkonen, which could leave Verstappen as the main man at the four-time constructor champions next season. Kvyat once held that expectation, but now the pressure is on Verstappen and Coulthard, who drove for the team from its formation in 2005, believes the son of Jos Verstappen has already shown enough to suggest he will excel in the senior team.\n\u201cI think all the indications are that he is more than capable,\u201d says the 13-time grand prix winner. \u201cIt\u2019s that wonderfully overused word said to excite people, he\u2019s got lots of \u2018potential\u2019. Whether he realises that potential or not will rest on his shoulders, it will rest on the racing gods as to whether he gets the car that gives him the opportunity to win.\n\u201cIf he does, he\u2019ll win, if he doesn\u2019t he won\u2019t. If he does get in a winning car, Red Bull may win a race this year though clearly there\u2019s a deficit on the engine side. I have no doubt that if you slot him into the Red Bull of three years ago where they had the package of front rows and race wins, he would be in the mix to win a race.\u201d\nVerstappen made history last season by breaking a string of records \u2013 the youngest ever F1 driver and the youngest driver to score championship points among them \u2013 but at the age of 18, is he ready to step into a car that is challenging regularly for the podium?\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember people saying \u2018this is ridiculous\u2019 when Boris Becker won Wimbledon at 16, they just went \u2018wow this is incredible, a 16-year-old has won Wimbledon\u2019,\u201d explains Coulthard.\n\u201cOf course if you start early, you tend to finish early and it\u2019s a very physical sport. When I started along with my generation, you couldn\u2019t start until you were 11 years old so you tended to arrive a bit later. Now they can start at eight, in the case of Max he\u2019s been driving since he was about three or four year old so he\u2019s actually the perfectly bred racing specimen, isn\u2019t he?\n\u201cWhat does he lack? He lacks life experience and the maturity that goes with that. He certainly doesn\u2019t lack real experience, and if I remember correctly Lewis [Hamilton]in his first year of Formula One equalled [Fernando] Alonso who was a two-time world champion. He didn\u2019t lack real experience.\n\u201cI think we have to be careful because age isn\u2019t necessarily a good gage of maturity. You get some incredibly mature teenagers and you get some f***wits that are in their 30s. I think it\u2019s more down to individuals, how they are brought up, their DNA, how they view things, a whole number of factors that separate the good from the great.\u201d\nSpeaking of great, the conversation quickly moves to the ongoing battle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. Despite witnessing his Mercedes team-mate win back-to-back world championship, Rosberg holds all the cards heading to Catalunya, having reeled of seven straight grand prix victories stretching back to last season and leading Hamilton by a healthy 43 points \u2013 the largest gap Rosberg has held over the three-time champion during their rollercoaster time together.\nHamilton, who clinched his first title in 2008, is bidding to join both Vettel and Alain Prost as four-time world champions \u2013 the latter coincidentally joins Coulthard as part of Channel 4\u2019s broadcast of this weekend\u2019s grand prix \u2013 and Coulthard believes that if Hamilton can chase down and beat Rosberg to another title, it will put him among the greats of the sport.\n\u201cIf he can fight back and take this championship battle down to the wire, yes there\u2019s no question,\u201d Coulthard says of the magnitude of Hamilton\u2019s task. \u201cIf he can help cement what is already a very impressive line-up of statistics then he\u2019ll go down as one of the greats in Formula One.\n\u201cIf Nico wins the championship without Lewis actually having the chance to go wheel-to-wheel with him then it won\u2019t change the fact of who gets the silverware, but it will change in history the perception whether it was a great fight or not.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose that Nico really cares right now and I don\u2019t think I would particularly mind if my team-mate had some difficulties but I think deep down in every racer you look for the big challenge and you want the fast team-mate and you want to be able to stand beside you on the podium knowing that you beat them in a fair fight, not because you inherited it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly how I viewed it. I inherited victories that I didn\u2019t feel I truly deserved, but on that day my car was more reliable or there were less technical issues, and there were other days when, very occasionally, I\u2019d have Michael [Schumacher] and Mika [Hakkinen] besides me and they didn\u2019t have any big issues of note, I just managed to get my finger out and deliver on that day.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens this season, whether Nico fares well when he is actually duelling it out with Lewis because he haven\u2019t seen that so far this year.\u201d\nAll signs point to that battle finally commencing at Catalunya, providing Mercedes can get their act together and produce two reliable cars capable of going the entire weekend without a hiccup along the way. Last season, Rosberg finally got one over Hamilton and beat him in a fair fight, and given that neither driver has excelled in Barcelona having taken a win apiece, it could well prove to be the race that ignites the championship battle.", "Championship leader Nico Rosberg laid down the gauntlet to Lewis Hamilton by topping the timesheets in second practice for the Spanish Grand Prix.\nRosberg, who has sauntered to victory at each of the four races so far this season to establish a 43-point lead over Hamilton, was nearly three quarters of a second faster than his Mercedes team-mate on Friday.\nIndeed Hamilton's best lap at the Circuit de Catalunya was good enough only for third with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen splitting the Mercedes pair. Sebastian Vettel, fastest in the opening session, was fourth quickest in the sister Ferrari.\nRosberg is bidding to win an eighth consecutive race - a streak which stretches back to last season - and one which would see him become only the second driver to win as many grands prix in succession in the modern era. He is currently tied with Michael Schumacher, while Vettel holds the record with nine.\nThe 30-year-old German has played down his incredible run of success, but should he take to the top step of the podium once more on Sunday, both Vettel's winning record, and more importantly the championship, will surely be at the forefront of his mind.\nFor Hamilton, who visited New York, Athens, Miami, Barbados and Monaco following the last race in Russia, he is without a win since his dramatic triumph in October's United States Grand Prix - the scene of his third championship - now 200 days ago.\nThe Briton is due some luck, with car problems stalling the defence of his title, but a scruffy lap here in practice, forced him settle for third on Friday.\nThe second session in Barcelona as Formula One returns to Spain for the traditional start of the European season, was suspended for nearly 10 minutes after Briton's Jolyon Palmer suffered a high speed tyre blow-out in the opening moments.\nThe 25-year-old, who on Thursday insisted he will see out the season with Renault despite suggestions he could be replaced by Frenchman Esteban Ocon, brought his car to a halt at turn one.\nThe stricken Renault was taken back to the garage on a pick-up truck, while Palmer had to make do with the back of a scooter.

Society's\u00a0sexualisation of women\u2019s breasts and, as a result, the rush to censor\u00a0them is an issue that caught international attention when even new\u00a0mothers found their breastfeeding\u00a0pictures being removed from Instagram or their accounts suspended. Pictures of breastfeeding \nIt isn\u2019t just Instagram that still has a ban on breasts in public. There are a number of places in the US where women who expose their breasts in public are technically committing a crime. According to \nIn 2014,\u00a0\nCovington is challenging\u00a0the criminalisation of women choosing not to wear shirts and bras in places where men are allowed to walk bare-chested as part of a wider fight for gender equality.\u00a0\nThe 27-year-old, who prefers the gender-neutral term bare-chested to topless,\u00a0lives in Maryland and documents her experiences\u00a0on her blog, \nThe topfreedom movement\nCovington says her hopes are for fears of the female body to be diminished\u00a0in order to reach the point where a woman appearing bare-chested in public isn't considered a subversive act.\nCovington is against the ownership of a woman\u2019s body being in the hands of anyone other than that woman herself, not against feeling sexual excitement from breasts, as she explains on her blog. \u201cI do think it is wrong that women are often reduced to their bodies and that because some people consider some female breasts sexually exciting all females somehow should lose the right to control what we do with them, when men do not.\u201d\u00a0\nThe\nThere is something about quietly walking bare-chested that really resonates\u00a0within me, the other women who do it and with each observer. The female breast has all of this context, and people associate the female breast with so many different things. It can be a symbol of pride and shame, power and vulnerability, health and disease.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s common for critics to try to diminish the topfreedom movement by saying it isn\u2019t important \u2013 all this wasted effort and debate, they say, about who gets to wear shirts and who doesn\u2019t. Well, if it really isn\u2019t that important, just treat everyone equally. It shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal.\nI can see the undercurrent of that lingering prejudice sometimes in the facial expressions of people who see me, professionals, successful-looking people, people who I imagine would swear up and down they support gender equality, but then falter when faced with what that equality really means. I don\u2019t confront these people beyond taking notice. It\u2019s their work to do.\nI do look forward to the day when female bare-chestedness is no more or less remarkable than male bare-chestedness, because it will mean we have come a long way in how we consider the female body sexually, medically and politically, and how we value equality.\nNo. But I do go bare-chested a lot. Personal comfort is my guide. If I wish to do so, I do. I prefer the physical comfort bare-chestedness gives me, but also the feeling of freedom. I was not always this comfortable with my body and I\u2019m still not always. Women have so many voices telling us we are ugly, lacking, shameful. I\u2019m working hard to be done with those voices, and I\u2019m sharing my work with the world. Most days I\u2019m successful. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nAs friends and family found out about my walks, they were incredibly curious and fascinated by my stories. They asked me to start a blog. I am not remotely the first woman to do this work so I wanted to add something that wasn\u2019t being done. I saw an unaddressed niche in the peaceful but direct approach with police, the quietly unapologetic, non-confrontational approach with the public, doing normal things to make it all look and feel normal, using the legal processes at my disposal to bring topfreedom to places where it wasn\u2019t before.\nGreat, now. Things began improving in 2013. Prior to that, police around the whole country were pretty aggressive and hostile. \u00a0But so many women began taking on the challenge that the conversation has improved significantly. It\u2019s still not easy and these are long, repetitive conversations.\u00a0Some police don\u2019t want to hear it. But this month I\u2019ve been getting some appreciative correspondence from law enforcement thanking me for my patient and professional approach. Two officials have even congratulated me on my success. I have learned so much about how law enforcement works, and how laws are created, interpreted and enforced.\nIt can be pretty disheartening at times to see how entrenched stereotypes affect policing and lawmaking.\u00a0But I would really like to celebrate the Washington DC, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh police departments for being professional with me and this whole topfreedom learning curve. Maryland police have not been so enlightened so far, which is strange because Maryland is actually crystal clear about guaranteeing gender equality from the state constitution all the way down to local ordinances. But several Maryland police officials have told me since Maryland law doesn\u2019t say female bare-chestedness is explicitly legal, they will treat is as illegal, and I will have to fight it by getting arrested and winning in court. Ponder that. Name one other law where someone would have to prove what isn\u2019t included in the law isn\u2019t illegal.\u00a0\nAbsolutely. Beside the fact that women are going peacefully bare-chested in a lot of places now, my most compelling proof of positive change is the comments section on my YouTube videos and blog. Not because they are filled with gads of supporters - they aren\u2019t always - but because the tone of the dissent is so often respectful, mature and controlled. In this day and age of ubiquitous vitriol, the conversation happening around my blog is actually quite mature. Not everyone gets it. There are unenlightened souls who say some profoundly unenlightened things (like the gentleman who testified to the New Hampshire legislature that women need to be protected from equality), but I am quite pleased with how things are going.

It is believed that this may also be due to patients being over prescribed the medication, particularly for routine illnesses or infections which could be treated otherwise.\nIn March of this year, the EU voted to support draft plans to restrict drug use in livestock farming, however this has not yet passed into statute.\nG7 leaders are due to discuss antibiotic resistance when meeting in Japan for a summit later this month.", "A rare one penny piece has been sold for \u00a372,000, smashing the world record for most expensive copper coin.\nThe Lavrillier Pattern Penny was cast in 1933 and is one of only four ever made.\nIt was sold at auction by\u00a0AH Baldwin and Sons on 4 May after a fierce battle between two telephone bidders.\nPotential buyers flew into London from Australia, United States and New Zealand to watch the auction as it happened.\u00a0\nThe coin is decorated on one side with the likeness of King George V, and on the other with the female spirit Britannia.\nOf the four in existence, one of the pattern pennies is kept in the Royal Mint Museum in Wales and the remaining three are privately-owned.\nThe hefty price tag is \u201ctestament to the current strength in British numismatics [the study of coins]\u201d, according to the auction house.\nThere were only seven 1p coins made in 1933 as the Royal Mint produced a surplus the year before.\nIn March the world\u2019s most valuable coin was put on public display in London.\nThe \u2018Amon Carter\u2019 Silver Dollar was the first dollar coin to be minted in the United States and has a value of over $10 million.\nThe world record for the price of a British coin was set when the Edward VIII gold proof sovereign was sold for \u00a3516,000 in May 2014.", "A woman\u00a0has been sent home from work for refusing to wear high heels, it has been reported.\nTemp worker Nicola Thorp says she arrived for her first day in a new role at the London offices of accountancy firm PwC wearing flat shoes.

It follows a number of attacks in Northern Ireland by dissident Republicans who do not accept the peace process and wish to remove British presence in the region by force.\nThe new group, which calls itself the IRA, is known as the New IRA locally.\nThe New IRA is a violent paramilitary group based in Republican districts of west\u00a0Belfast and having some activity in Dublin. It is formed of dissident Republicans who reject Northern Ireland\u2019s peace process which saw paramilitary groups decommission weapons in order to end The Troubles.\nThe IRA was disbanded upon decommissioning and has been inactive for several years. However, recent events have seen a new group emerge under the name. The group call themselves \u2018the IRA\u2019 and are known in local media and in Northern Irish communities as \u2018the New IRA\u2019.\nThe IRA have historically sought to end British presence in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and re-unite with the Republic of Ireland.\nTheir motives for emerging now are unclear. Northern Irish police have suggested it may be in part due to raised tensions connected to the centenary anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising which is a core historical event for Republicans.\u00a0\u200b\nGiven the illegal nature of the group, it is difficult to estimate numbers. However, locally there is very little support for the group and the overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland are committed to the region\u2019s peace process and strongly oppose any paramilitary groups or violence.\u200b\u200b\nOver the last few years a number of incidents have been ascribed to the group, while the number has spiked in recent months. In May, a former IRA commander was executed in front of children outside a primary school in Belfast. In August, another IRA man was killed in what the group call a \u2018six pack\u2019, a shot in each elbow, ankle and knee. After the deaths, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland announced that the IRA still existed despite ceasing to operate following the peace process.\nThey have also been linked to the death of a man in Dublin last month. At the man\u2019s funeral last week, police arrested fourteen men under terrorism legislation after they allegedly wore paramilitary uniforms in the style of the IRA.\nShortly before Easter, a bomb was placed under the car of a prison officer which detonated as he was traveling to work. He died shortly after.\u00a0\nOn Monday, three people in West Belfast were shot within 24 hours, raising concerns that actions may be escalating.\nMI5 say the threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland from Northern Irish groups is \u201csevere\u201d.

has claimed.\nThe report, compiled by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, has concluded \u201cpeoples\u2019 deaths or suffering could have been prevented if hospitals carried out the right checks before discharging people\u201d. The report found that vulnerable patients including very elderly people have been released without their families or carers being informed, meaning that they are left alone without any support. Other patients have been\u00a0released without appropriate assessments being undertaken and have died within hours or returning to their homes.\nLast year 221 complaints were submitted to the Ombudsman regarding NHS discharge procedures, an increase by a third upon the previous year.\nOne case criticised by the Ombudsman involved an 85-year-old woman suffering from dementia who was taken to hospital after experiencing vaginal bleeding. She was discharged from hospital at 11pm and sent to a care home, without family members being informed. The following morning, her daughter found her after she had been left overnight with no food, drink or bedding, unable to care for herself or go to the toilet.\nIn another case, an 84-year-old woman was discharged \u201cto an empty home and in a confused state\u201d with a catheter still inserted.

She told The Independent: \u201cIt is simply unacceptable if patients are being discharged without their family knowing or late at night, especially if they are elderly or vulnerable patients. The decision to discharge a patient must be done on the basis of the patient being ready to leave the hospital, rather than on the hospital requiring a bed. Patients need to be treated with care, compassion and dignity.\u201d\nA spokesperson for NHS Improvement told The Independent:\u201cPatients should never be discharged from hospital without the appropriate safeguards in place and without families having been informed.\n\u201cBetter discharge processes, such as those being worked on by NHS Improvement's Emergency Care Improvement Programme to support local health systems to make improvements, will result in vulnerable patients being protected whilst reducing potentially harmful delays in appropriately discharging those who are medically fit.\n\u201cRather than frail elderly people staying in hospital longer than they need to, it is better to get patients home as quickly as possible and to assess them in their own homes rather than in a hospital - but this must be done with the right help and support in place.\u201d", "RAF jets have been scrambled to intercept three Russian aircraft\u00a0spotted approaching Baltic airspace in their latest intervention to keep Britain's skies secure.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Typhoon fighter jets were launched from Amari air base in Estonia after the Russian military transport aircrafts did not transmit a recognised identification code and appeared to be unresponsive.\nDefence Secretary Michael Fallon called it an \"act of Russian aggression\".\nHe said: \"This is another example of just how important the UK's contribution to the Baltic Air Policing Mission is.

Even if there is no direct biblical evidence linking Judas to the 13th place at the table, the number of guests at the Last Supper and its significance in the Christian religion could have been enough to cement the idea of 13 as an unlucky number in Western cultures, particularly if this idea was promoted by the superstitious Victorians.\u00a0\nIronically, the superstition of the event may be linked back to an American club that attempted to debunk the superstition surrounding the number 13 and its associated bad luck date.\nThe Thirteen Club first met on 13 September 1881 (a Wednesday) and determined to actively flout any and all established \u2018superstitions\u2019 they knew about.\u00a0\nWith this in mind, the group of 13 would meet on the 13 of each month, sit 13 to a table, break mirrors, spill salt with abandon, and walk under ladders \u2013 all while carefully recording how many members died.\nOver the years the group grew to roughly 400 members \u2013 including a number of US presidents \u2013 but the groups notoriety just added to the date\u2019s significance in the public psyche.\nThen, in 1907, eccentric stockbroker Thomas Lawson published a book called Friday the Thirteenth. It detailed an evil business\u2019s attempts to crash the stock market on the unluckiest day of the year. The book was a sell-out and in 1916 made into a feature-length film.\nFinally, the myth acquired the first seal of Hollywood in 1980 when Paramount Pictures released Friday the 13. Fridays would not be the same again, after Jason proceeded to slash his way across a summer camp and US box offices.\nThere have been various studies released over the years that either prove or disprove the Friday 13 myth.\nIn 1993 a British Medical Journal study claimed there was a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in incidences on a Friday the 13, but the author of the study later confessed it was \u201ca bit of fun\u201d as traditional in the Christmas edition.\nMeanwhile, Dutch researchers found you were actually less likely to be injured on Friday 13th. The study hypothesised that people were preventively more careful on the day as a result of the superstition.\nAs it turns out, paraskevidekatriaphobia is mostly an American and English fear.\nItalians previously used to be far more concerned about Friday the 17th, although with the Americanisation of the country this has largely shifted to 13th for younger generations.\nIn Spanish-speaking countries it is Tuesdays, not Fridays, that hold superstitious omens. Their belief is also held by the Greeks, who consider Tuesdays as dominated by the influence of Ares (the God of War).", "A man has fallen to his death from a Hilton hotel\u2019s rooftop bar overlooking the Tower of \nThe man, believed to be in his 40s, died at the scene outside a DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in front of \u201cscreaming\u201d onlookers at the start of Thursday\u2019s evening rush hour.\nParamedics battled to save his life on the pavement but he died at the scene.\nBalazs Szeljak, 35, a shift manager at the nearby Cheshire Cheese pub, told the \n\u201cSome people were screaming,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t help him, there was nothing he could do as he was in such a bad way.\n\u201cBy the time I got outside the police had already sealed off the area and were telling people to get inside.\u201d\nThe man, who has not been named, is believed to have fallen from the luxury hotel\u2019s SkyLounge bar, which has a terrace overlooking the City of London and River Thames on the 12th floor.\nPolice quickly closed off the area outside the DoubleTree by Hilton Tower of London and moved drinkers off the rooftop bar.\nOne customer described the terrace as \u201cpacked\u201d on the warm, sunny afternoon and said they had no idea what had happened when officers arrived.\nCity of London Police said the man\u2019s death was not being treated as suspicious.\n\u201cOfficers and the London Ambulance Service were called at 4.51pm to report of a man injured having fallen from a building,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\u201cHe was initially believed to be in a serious condition but died at the scene.

He exhorted fellow conservatives to \u201cstand up for what we believe, which is not embodied by either choice on the menu in November.\u201d\nNor has there been anything to suggest that billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch are about to reconsider their decision to stay on the sidelines of the 2016 election because of their distaste for Mr Trump. \u00a0They had been expected to pour as much as $900 million into the favourite super PACs that could have given the Republican crucial help. \u00a0Another group, American Crossroads led by Karl Rove, has also not said yet if it will board a Trump train.\nAfter winning the Indiana primary last week and thus forcing his last two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, from the nomination contest, Mr Trump almost instantly acknowledged that he could not continue funding his campaign on his own and hired Steven Mnuchin, a hedge fund CEO and former Goldman Sachs executive to head a his finance committee going forward. \u00a0Mr Mnuchin was a key member of the Trump delegation in Washington DC this week.\u00a0\nFinding a way to join hands with the Republican Party machine is also crucial because of all the voter data it could offer the Trump campaign which thus far has almost none of its own, in contrast to far more sophisticated back-up enjoyed by Ms Clinton and by her rival Bernie Sanders, who on Tuesday night were locked in competition again in the primary contest in West Virginia.\u00a0\nThe threadbare nature of the Camp Trump was in evidence again on Tuesday when it emerged that Corey Lewandowski, who is the campaign manager, would also take on the task of launching the search for a running mate to join their ticket.\u00a0", "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has claimed that a computer error resulted in a well known white supremacist being included on a list of potential delegates in the state of California.\nThe campaign has said that \nMr Johnson, who recorded an automated campaign call on behalf of Mr Trump that ran in several states earlier this year, says he received an email from the Trump campaign confirming that he had been chosen to represent the New York tycoon.\n\u201cI contacted the office and I was approved without a lot of oversight,\u201d Mr Johnson told \nThe selection of Mr Johnson - first reported by Mother Jones - is deeply embarrassing for the the campaign of a candidate who has previously been accused of failing to distance himself from far right groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, who have announced support for the tycoon.

Its website listed several of his quotations, including one that dated from 1985 and said: \u201cNo person shall be a citizen of the United States unless he is a non-Hispanic white of the European race.\u00a0Only citizens shall have the right and privilege to reside permanently in the United States.\u201d\nMr Johnson, who heads the American Freedom Party, said that he stood by the comment.\u00a0Mr Trump\u2019s campaign said that Mr Johnson\u2019s inclusion was the result of an error that had been addressed.\u00a0\nThe \nSam Mahood, a spokesman for the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office, said the Trump campaign had attempted to submit a revised list of delegates to the office on Tuesday, a day after the deadline. It was rejected.\nHowever, Mr Mahood said state election law allows candidates to submit a list of alternates within 30 days after the June 7 primary. He said it would be up to the Republican National Committee or the state Republican Party to set the process for replacing a delegate with an alternate.", "Donald Trump has sparked fresh controversy by declaring he will not release his tax returns - making him the first major party presidential candidate to refuse to do so in four decades.\nThe presumptive Republican candidate said he did not intend to make public the information ahead of November\u2019s election and said he did not believe voters were interested in what details it may contain.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to learn from them,\u201d Mr Trump told the \nThe release of tax returns is not a legal requirement for by presidential candidates, but there is a lengthy tradition of the parties nominees releasing the information that details their earnings, charitable donations and taxes paid.\u00a0\nJoseph Thorndike of the Tax History Project, said Mr Trump would be the first major candidate since 1976 to not make any of his full returns public. President Gerald Ford released a tax summary that year, but not his full records.\n\u201cI think 40 years of tradition carries real moral and ethical weight,\u201d Mr Thorndike said. \u201cIt is quite striking that a major candidate would decide not to release their tax information, especially someone with an admittedly complex tax situation.\u201d\nDuring the primary battle, Mr Trump promised that he would release his tax information but said he was unable to do so immediately because he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and that his lawyers advised him against it. Mr Trump has also explained that he cannot release returns from previous years because the government audits him almost every year.\nMr Trump told the news agency that he would release the information once the IRS audit ends, but said if it was not completed by election day, he would not simply release them.\nThe financial disclosure Mr Trump gave to the Federal Election Commission last summer that he was worth $10bn, but it was inexact and incomplete.\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney released his tax returns in 2012 and urged Mr Trump to do so this year, suggesting that he may be reluctant to do so because he was either not as wealthy as he claimed or else had not been paying \u201cthe kind of taxes we would expect him to pay.\u201d\nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has released over 20 years of her joint returns with former President Bill Clinton, dating from 1992 up until\u00a02014, and Bernie Sanders released his 2014 tax return in April.\nIn a speech at a rally in New Jersey on Wednesday, Mr Clinton seized on Mr Trump\u2019s refusal to release his returns.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself, why doesn\u2019t he want to release it?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out.\u201d", "The Secret Service has confirmed it will investigate comments made by Donald Trump\u2019s longtime butler calling for President Obama to be killed.\u00a0\n\u201cThe US Secret Service is aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation,\u201d agency spokesman Robert Hoback said in a statement.\u00a0\nAnthony Senecal, who worked as a butler to the presumptive GOP presidential nominee for 17 years, until 2009, wrote in a recent Facebook post that Mr Obama should be shot by the military as an \u201cenemy agent.\u201d\n\u201cTo all my friends on FB, just a short note to you on our pus headed \u201cpresident\u201d !!!!

No cameras were allowed.\nAnd so anyone interested in the wound that has eaten away at\u00a0the Republican Party, and the talks between Paul Ryan and Donald Trump aimed at healing it, was\u00a0forced to settle for the claim that \u201cthe meeting was great\u201d and that everyone was suddenly the best of friends. Except, of course, that they\u00a0are not.\nA week after the most powerful elected Republican politician said he was not yet ready to endorse the party\u2019s presumptive candidate for the White House, Mr Ryan and Mr Trump met face to face for the first time to try and repair the breach.\u00a0Yet when that 30-minute\u00a0meeting was over, Mr Ryan was still not ready to offer his backing to the real estate\u00a0tycoon.\nThe two men were joined at Republican National Committee (RNC) headquarters in Washington DC by its chairman, Reince Priebus. Mr Trump later met senior Republicans from both the House and Senate and\u00a0Mr\u00a0Priebus took to Twitter to declare: \u201cThe meeting was great.\u00a0It was a very positive step toward party unity.\u201d\u00a0\nThe pair also later issued a joint\u00a0statement that stressed their common ground. \"This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step towards unification,\" it said.\nYet in remarks to reporters after the meeting, Mr Ryan still\u00a0stopped short of endorsing the 69-year-old New Yorker.\n\"There's no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today,\u201d Mr Ryan said \"I do believe we are planting the seeds in getting ourselves unified.\"\nMr Trump tweeted: \"Great day in DC\u00a0with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well!\"\nThe meeting between the two men who will be most responsible for overseeing the party\u2019s summer convention and its campaigns this autumn, came after Mr Trump became the de facto nominee after he secured a huge victory in last week\u2019s Indiana primary, a win that forced his sole surviving rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, to drop out of the race.\nHis victory and his emergence as the presumptive nominee was a final blow to the Republican establishment that had sought to do all it could to block him. A number of leading conservatives said they could not bring themselves to support a nominee whose views and policies were at such variance with Republican traditions.\nA number of elected Republican officials, including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, offered their support to Mr Trump. However, Mr Ryan, who has to balance his control of an anxious, conservative House and his relationship with the party\u2019s nominee, sought to put some space between himself and Mr Trump.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point,\u201d Mr Ryan told CNN last week, when asked if he was supporting Mr Trump. \u201cI'm not there right now.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI think what is required is that we unify this party. And I think the bulk of the burden of unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.\u201d\nMr Trump, whose campaign has been marked by his brashness and willingness to denounce the party\u2019s hierarchy, hit back by saying he was not \u201cready to adopt\u201d Mr Ryan\u2019s agenda.\nThe \nMr Trump entered the RNC building, the venue a few blocks from the Capitol, through a side door as about a dozen protesters who oppose his immigration positions demonstrated at the front, chanting \u201cDown, down with deportation. Up, up with liberation.\u201d\u00a0\nThey tried to deliver a cardboard coffin to the RNC representing the suffering of immigrants under GOP policies and what they say will be the death of the party under Trump. They were not allowed inside.\u00a0\nBefore the meeting, Mr Ryan insisted party unity was his goal.\n\"We come from different wings of the party,\u201d Mr Ryan said on Wednesday. \u201cThe goal here is to unify the various wings of the party around common principles, so that we can go forward to unify it.\u201d\nMr Trump suggested he was less concerned about the support of Washington politicians.\n\u201cIf we make a deal, that will be great,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cAnd if we don't, we will trudge forward like I've been doing and winning all the time.\u201d", "Anthony Senecal, the longtime butler of Donald Trump, said he\u00a0had already been questioned by the Secret Service over messages he posted on social media calling for the death of Barack Obama.\nThe 84-year-old, who filled the intimate role for the presumptive Republican nominee until 2009, said that a Secret Service agent and three police officers visited him at his home in Lake Worth, Florida, on Thursday evening.\n\u201cThey came to my apartment. There was one Secret Service agent and three sheriff\u2019s deputies,\u201d\nAsked if\u00a0he believed the agency was taking the messages he posted on Facebook seriously, he said: \u201cThey have to.\u201d\nMr Senecal, the subject of a lengthy profile in the \nIn a conversation during which he appeared several times to contradict himself, Mr Senecal said that he had not threatened Mr Obama.

He denied they contained racist language or that he was a racist.\n\u201cNot true. I\u2019m not a racist.

In a statement released earlier this week it said it was \"aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation.\u201d", "Over the past three months, as Trump and Clinton secured their grip on their party\u2019s presidential nominations, US pollsters have been quietly surveying tens of thousands of Americans.\nMore than 15 different polling companies have now collectively quizzed more than 150,000 people, across 65 different polls.\nThe bad news for Donald Trump, and reassuring news for the rest of us?\nHillary Clinton has led in 63 of those 65 polls, and trailed in just one.\nThe average result \nA more recent average of the nearly two dozen polls published in the past month, as both became their party\u2019s near-certain nominees, gives Clinton 45 and Trump 39.\nThe picture is clear.

If no major third party candidate stands, she will need around 50 per cent of the vote. She seems to be a few points short.\nRoughly one-in-six voters, or just over 15 per cent of the electorate, have refused to choice between Clinton and Trump when asked over the past three months.\nMost have declared themselves undecided.

The latest odds, as of a few minutes ago? 29 per cent.", "The voice is instantly familiar; the tone, confident, even cocky; the cadence, distinctly Trumpian. The man on the phone vigorously defending Donald Trump says he\u2019s a media spokesman named John Miller, but then he says, \u201cI\u2019m sort of new here,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m somebody that he knows and I think somebody that he trusts and likes\u201d and even \u201cI\u2019m going to do this a little, part-time, and then, yeah, go on with my life.\u201d\nA recording obtained by The Washington Post captures what New York reporters and editors who covered Trump\u2019s early career experienced in the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201990s: calls from Trump\u2019s Manhattan office that resulted in conversations with \u201cJohn Miller\u201d or \u201cJohn Barron\u201d \u2014 public-relations men who sound precisely like Trump himself \u2014 who indeed are Trump, masquerading as an unusually helpful and boastful advocate for himself, according to the journalists and several of Trump\u2019s top aides.\nIn 1991, Sue Carswell, a reporter at People magazine, called Trump\u2019s office seeking an interview with the developer. She had just been assigned to cover the soap opera surrounding the end of Trump\u2019s 12-year marriage to Ivana, his budding relationship with the model Marla Maples and his rumored affairs with any number of celebrities who regularly appeared on the gossip pages of the New York newspapers.\nWithin five minutes, Carswell got a return call from Trump\u2019s publicist, a man named John Miller, who immediately jumped into a startlingly frank and detailed explanation of why Trump dumped Maples for the Italian model Carla Bruni. \u201cHe really didn\u2019t want to make a commitment,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming out of a marriage, and he\u2019s starting to do tremendously well financially.\u201d\nMiller turned out to be a remarkably forthcoming source \u2014 a spokesman with rare insight into the private thoughts and feelings of his client. \u201cHave you met him?\u201d Miller asked the reporter. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, and he\u2019s not going to hurt anybody. . . . He treated his wife well and . . . he will treat Marla well.\u201d\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in his office at Trump Tower. (Mary Altaffer/AP)\nSome reporters found the calls from Miller or Barron disturbing or even creepy; others thought they were just examples of Trump being playful. Today, as the presumptive Republican nominee for president faces questions about his attitudes toward women, what stands out to some who received those calls is Trump\u2019s characterization of women who he portrayed as drawn to him sexually.\n\u201cActresses,\u201d Miller said in the call to Carswell, \u201cjust call to see if they can go out with him and things.\u201d Madonna \u201cwanted to go out with him.\u201d And Trump\u2019s alter ego boasted that in addition to living with Maples, Trump had \u201cthree other girlfriends.\u201d\nMiller was consistent about referring to Trump as \u201che,\u201d but at one point, when asked how important Bruni was in Trump\u2019s busy love life, the spokesman said, \u201cI think it\u2019s somebody that \u2014 you know, she\u2019s beautiful. I saw her once, quickly, and beautiful . . . \u201d and then he quickly pivoted back into talking about Trump \u2014 then a 44-year-old father of three \u2014 in the third person.\nIn 1990, Trump testified in a court case that \u201cI believe on occasion I used that name.\u201d He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\nIn a phone call to NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program Friday morning, Trump denied that he was John Miller. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it \u2014 I don\u2019t know anything about it. You\u2019re telling me about it for the first time and it doesn\u2019t sound like my voice at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and then you can imagine that, and this sounds like one of the scams, one of the many scams \u2014 doesn\u2019t sound like me.\u201d Later, he was more definitive: \u201cIt was not me on the phone. And it doesn\u2019t sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that, and it was not me on the phone. And when was this? Twenty-five years ago?\u201d\nTrump has never been terribly adamant about denying that he often made calls to reporters posing as someone else. From his earliest years in business, he occasionally called reporters using the name \u201cJohn Barron.\u201d\nA \u201cJohn Baron,\u201d described as a \u201cvice-president of the Trump organization,\u201d appeared in a front-page New York Times article as early as 1980, defending Trump\u2019s decision to destroy sculptures on the facade of the Bonwit Teller department store building, the Fifth Avenue landmark he was demolishing to make way for his Trump Tower. Barron was quoted variously as a \u201cTrump spokesman,\u201d \u201cTrump executive,\u201d or \u201cTrump representative\u201d in New York magazine, The Washington Post and other publications.\nTrump\u2019s fascination with the name \u201cBarron\u201d persisted for decades. When he was seeing Maples while still married to Ivana, he sometimes used the code name \u201cthe Baron\u201d when he left messages for her. In 2004, when Trump commissioned a dramatic TV series based on the life of a New York real estate mogul like him, his only request to the writer was to name the main character \u201cBarron.\u201d And when Trump and his third wife, Melania, had a son, they named him Barron.\nIn the 1991 recording, Miller sounded quite at ease regaling the reporter with tales of Trump hanging out with Madonna at a ball at the Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time. Asked about the rumored Madonna-Trump friendship, Miller, unlike every other PR man on the planet, neither batted the question away nor gave it short shrift. Rather, he said, \u201cDo you have a second?\u201d\nCarswell, the reporter, sounded a bit startled: \u201cYeah, obviously,\u201d she replied.\nWhereupon Miller offered a detailed account of the Trump encounter with Madonna, who \u201ccame in a beautiful evening gown and combat boots.\u201d The PR man assured the reporter that nothing untoward occurred: \u201cHe\u2019s got zero interest that night.\u201d\nMiller also revealed to Carswell why Trump seemed to relish any and all media coverage, even the most critical. \u201cI can tell you that he didn\u2019t care if he got bad PR until he got his divorce finished,\u201d Miller said. The more the press wrote about Trump\u2019s money troubles, the greater advantage he would have in negotiations toward a financial settlement with his then-estranged wife, Ivana. Then, \u201conce his divorce is finished,\u201d Miller said, you would see stories about how Trump was \u201cdoing well financially and he\u2019s doing well in every other way.\u201d\nCarswell this week recalled that she immediately recognized something familiar in the Queens accent of Trump\u2019s new publicist. She thought, \u201cIt\u2019s so weird that Donald hired someone who sounds just like him.\u201d After the 20-minute interview, she walked down the hall to play the tape to co-workers, who identified Trump\u2019s voice. Carswell then called Cindy Adams, the longtime New York Post gossip columnist who had been close to Trump since the early 1970s. Adams immediately identified the voice as Trump\u2019s.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s Donald,\u201d Carswell recalled Adams saying. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d\nThen Carswell played the tape for Maples, who confirmed it was Trump and burst into tears as she heard Miller deny that a ring Trump gave her implied any intent to marry her.\nCarswell, now a reporter-researcher at Vanity Fair, said the tape cuts off mid-interview, leaving out the part in which Miller said that actress Kim Basinger had been trying to date Trump. Hearing the tape for the first time in decades, Carswell said, \u201cThis was so farcical, that he pretended to be his own publicist. Here was this so-called billion-dollar real estate mogul, and he can\u2019t hire his own publicist. It also said something about the control he wanted to keep of the news cycle flowing with this story, and I can\u2019t believe he thought he\u2019d get away with it.\u201d\nThe Post obtained the recording from a source who asked to be identified only as a person with whom Carswell shared the microcassette of the call shortly after the interview.\nFrom the start of his career as a builder in New York, Trump worked the press. He believed in carrots and sticks, showering reporters with praise, then pivoting to a threat to sue them if they wrote something he considered inaccurate. He often said that all publicity, good or bad, was good for his business.\nHe made himself available to reporters at nearly any time, for hours on end. And he called them, too, to promote his own projects, but also with juicy bits of gossip.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned about the press is that they\u2019re always hungry for a good story, and the more sensational the better,\u201d Trump wrote in his bestseller \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cThe point is that if you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you.\u201d\nTrump did not describe using false identities to promote his brand, but he did write about why he strays from the strict truth: \u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201d\nCarswell was far from the only reporter who received calls from suspiciously Trumpian characters. Longtime New York Daily News gossip columnist Linda Stasi said Trump once left her a voice mail from an \u201canonymous tipster\u201d who wanted it known that Trump had been spotted going out with models. And editors at New York tabloids said calls from Barron were at points so common that they became a recurring joke on the city desk.\nAfter Carswell\u2019s story appeared \u2014 headlined \u201cTrump Says Goodbye Marla, Hello Carla . . . And a Mysterious PR Man Who Sounds Just Like Donald Calls to Spread the Story\u201d \u2014 Trump invited the reporter out for a night on the town with him and Maples. Carswell says Maples persuaded Trump to issue the invitation as an apology for tricking her. A few weeks later, when People ran a story about Trump and Maples getting engaged, Trump was quoted saying that the John Miller call was a \u201cjoke gone awry.\u201d\nCarswell had been skeptical all along. On the recording, she challenged Miller: \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d\n\u201cI basically worked for different firms,\u201d he replied cryptically. And then he marveled at his boss\u2019s ability to withstand critical news coverage: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen somebody so immune to . . . bad press.\u201d\nMiller was also impressed by his client\u2019s social life: \u201cI mean, he\u2019s living with Marla and he\u2019s got three other girlfriends . . . \u201d But the PR man wanted the reporter to know that Trump believed in \u201cthe marriage concept\u201d and planned to settle down, on his own terms: \u201cHe does things for himself. When he makes a decision, that will be a very lucky woman.\u201d", "Donald Trump, the probable Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential election, has said that he doesn't use offshore bank accounts and that his tax rates are no one's business.\nThe billionaire and reality television star told ABC's \nTrump then, incorrectly, stated that many presidents have not released their tax returns to the public.\u00a0ABC correspondent George Stephanopolous corrected Trump by saying that every single\u00a0presidential nominee\u00a0since 1976 has released their returns.\n\"Right but before 1976 most people didn't do it,\" Trump responded, \"I mean, it used to be a secret thing. I don't want it to be secret but I do want the audit to get finished.\"\n\u201cThere is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them,\u201d Romney "], "life-style/gadgets-and-tech": ["Figuring out how to start an email -- especially when you're writing to someone you don't know very well -- can be a real challenge.\nIs \"Hey\" too casual?

The Chancellor, George Osborne,\u00a0said the Bank's words showed that Brexit was a \"lose-lose situation for Britain, Either way we'd be poorer\".\nThe Bank did not produce any detailed forecasts for the economic damage resulting from Brexit. But \nThe Bank estimates that around half of that fall is due to due to traders' uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum.\nNeither the Leave or Remain sides have opened up a strong lead in the opinion polls.\nThe Bank warned that a leave vote could force the MPC into a tough trade off between raising rates to bring down inflation and cutting them to support growth.\n\u201cWhatever the outcome of the referendum and its consequences, the MPC will take whatever action is needed to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and inflation returns to the target over the appropriate horizon\u201d it said.\nThe Bank said the MPC had held a joint meeting with its Financial Policy Committee counterpart on 6 April to discuss \u201crisks to monetary and financial stability\u201d associated with the referendum.\nIt said a Brexit could result in a sharp drop in the willingness of foreigners to invest in British assets and \u201cpose a major financing difficulty for the United Kingdom\u201d.\nThe MPC voted unanimously today to keep interest rates on hold at their record low levels of 0.5 per cent, where they have been since 2009.\nAssuming no Brexit, the Bank said \u201cspare capacity\u201d in the UK economy was likely to be eliminated \u00a0\u201cearly next year\u201d.\u00a0\nSenior members of the Bank have. in the past. suggested that it will put up Bank rate before spare capacity is exhausted.\u00a0\nBut financial market are not pricing in an increase in the Bank rate until 2018 at the earliest.\nSome MPC members have publicly mooted the possibility of a further Bank rate cut if the economy stutters, even in the absence of Brexit.\nBut the Bank said today: \u201cThe MPC judges that it is more likely than not that Bank rate will need to be higher by the end of the forecast period than at present to ensure inflation returns to the target in a sustainable manner.\u201d", "Politicians are by far the most referenced occupation in the Panama Papers.\nThat's according to a chart created by a\u00a0data researcher from Denmark, who used Wikidata to plot the occupations associated with those featured in the leaked documents.\nFinn \u00c5rup Nielsen, senior researcher from the department of applied math and computer science at the Technical University of Denmark, published the bubble chart on his \nIt appears to show that politicians are mentioned most often, followed by lawyers, business people, entrepreneurs, and those working in association football.\nNielsen said the flaw with the Wikidata means that only people who are notable enough to get their own Wikipedia page will be included in the data, which might mean many smaller business people featured in the papers don't count towards the bubble chart.\nAt least three dozen Americans did\u00a0business with Mossack Fonseca, the\u00a0law firm based in Panama that wrote to all its clients to tell them it had leaked their details to the press on April 1.\nAmong the Americans listed are Len Gotshalk, a former Atlanta Falcons football star\u00a0who was charged in 2010 with being a key player in a kickbacks scheme to inflate stocks of tech companies. \u00a0Three days later, he bought a British Virgin Islands shell company that Mossack Fonseca had set up.\nEmma Watson's name has also been found in the searchable database published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.\u00a0\nWatson\u2019s spokesperson confirmed the 26-year-old had set up an offshore company, but added that she does not receive any tax or monetary advantages whatsoever.

Already smaller producers are going out of business, as only larger farms are able to accommodate the reduced prices,\u201d Gooch added.\nBut Gary Ford, chief poultry adviser at the National Farming Union told the Independent that cost of feed is more important than retail price to farmers.\n\u201cHigh demand has helped farmers to keep their margins higher and stimulate consumption,\u201d Ford said.", "A Sainsbury's store in Camden has attracted anger and disgust on Twitter after it advertised a job in the local paper for no pay.\nThe advert was posted on Twitter by a reader.\nIt asked for a \"creative and ambitious artist to voluntarily refurbish our canteen\".\nIt promised that the successful candidate would get \"experience in the creative industry while making our community a comfortable are for employees to escape to\" and that \"your work will contribute to our success\".\nCustomers were quick to react.\n\"Hi Sainsbury's, I now take food from you without paying because it is a great opportunity for you to impress me,\" wrote Adam Hess, who posted the original advert.\n\"But don't you know Adam that artists don't need to buy food or pay bills?

The company \nWhat's the current law? Can you be sacked for a wardrobe malfunction?\nEmployers are able to have dress rules for their employees. Dress requirements could be set out in contracts of employment or, more commonly, a relevant policy may be outlined in a staff handbook.\nIt's often stipulated that a breach of the policy could result in disciplinary action. In certain cases dismissal might be appropriate.\u00a0\nEven if the employer has no dress code policy, an employee could be dismissed for failing to follow reasonable instructions.\u00a0\nIn either case a dismissal would only be deemed fair if the employer carried out a fair process and acted reasonably in dismissing the employee. Dismissal for a first time breach, for instance, would probably not be considered a reasonable response by an employer.\u00a0\nWhat about having different dress codes for men and women? Is that discriminatory? No not in itself. But the same standards and level of smartness ought to apply to both sexes. Otherwise, men or women could be being treated less favourably because of sex.\u00a0\nAnd high heels for women? Many would argue that the requirement goes beyond smartness - and is actually about women showing a sexy image.\nAnd women are needlessly suffering humiliation and discomfort, risking back pain and bunions, because of it.

In March, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, described helicopter money as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d.\u00a0\nThe name comes from Milton Friedman, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite free-market economist. His 1969\u00a0idea was that central bankers could never fail to keep the money supply growing healthily since they could always drop freshly printed bills from a helicopter onto the cash-starved economy below.\nThis gets around the usual drawback of quantitative easing through the central bank buying up government debt. This can often end up raising the price of assets such as\u00a0the government bonds. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean consumers have more money to spend.\nStudies have shown that creating brand new money by using helicopter money has a limited effect on inflation when the economy is already verging on deflation.\nIt also means the new money created can be more evenly distributed than in conventional quantitative easing and doesn\u2019t simply benefit the rich who have lots of assets already.\nSome officials might be coming round to the idea because many major economies are still struggling to return to growth eight years after the global financial crisis.\nBut economists have argued that helicopter money should be considered as part of a bigger plan to revive the economy, rather than an outright solution in itself.\n\u201cThis should not be considered as a crazy idea but nor should it be considered as a panacea,\u201d Lord Adair said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe probably need it as part of the total toolkit. Once it is in the toolkit we need to use it with care, but we should not treat it as something unacceptable.\u201d", "Traditionally high-paying industries are increasingly losing popularity among UK graduates in search of professional development and stability, a study has found.\nUK graduates are turning away from the banking industry, whose\u00a0popularity has slipped 4 per cent since\u00a02014.\u00a0\nLikewise, engineering students are showing little interest in taking up jobs in oil companies.\u00a0\nTech giants Google and Apple have been named as most attractive employers in the UK, according to Universum, a global research and advisory firm. \u00a0\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a consulting firm, came in third place.\nUniversum surveyed more than 50,000 students across the UK at 109 universities and found that traditionally highly-paid jobs are no longer the big draw for new graduates.\nUK banks HSBC and Barclays, ranked low\u00a0at 27th and 28th on \nUncertainty over next month\u2019s European Union referendum, which might result in redundancies or positions being moved to other countries, has prompted students to turn to more stable career paths, according to Joao Araujo, manager of\u00a0Universum\u00a0UK and Ireland.\nBad press over \n\u201cWith the coming referendum we saw a spike in uncertainty.

The first thing she tells me is that she is tired, before showing me the stunning visual essay she developed to accompany her new music and to help those working with her to capture a sense of authenticity. Striking photos that inspired her, mainly taken from magazines, are surrounded by scrawled snippets straight from her imagination: \u2018This album will be truly dark and beautiful\u2019, \u2018Life is not clean-cut\u2019, \u2018All images must be glorious and vulnerable at once\u2019. The last song on the tracklist is simply titled \u201cWho I Am\u201d. There is clearly a theme.\nMvula has always loved paper and pictures and scribbling. \u201cThere was something grown-up about it to me, as a kid,\u201d she says in a calm, unintentionally majestic tone. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed having something tangible that you can hold and see in front of you. It seems to be how my brain works.\u201d A bigger sound was important to her on this album, she wanted everything to be much more stylised to make the songs come alive. \u201cIt\u2019s a selfish thing really,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt\u2019s about wanting to be heard.\u201d\nThe success of \nTurning 30 has proved a \u201creal rite of passage\u201d for Mvula, what with \u201ctelling everybody her business and divorcing and s**t\u201d. It\u2019s heavy stuff, but facing herself has led to feeling more alive than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone into the music, or maybe even the music has dictated that. It started way back, from a frustrated place, because I was suddenly part of this world where people make album after album,\u201d she says of the battle to resist the industry machine and create music on her own terms. \u201cNobody told me that it was this incessant treadmill thing that once you\u2019re on, it\u2019s hard to get off,\u201d she continues. \u201cI don\u2019t have kids but I can imagine what it\u2019s like being a mum for the first time. Your vagina\u2019s been bust open and someone\u2019s saying, \u2018Where\u2019s the next child?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s quite the analogy, but an apt one to describe the relentless, swirling pressure that so violently filled Mvula\u2019s head.\nProne to depression and spiralling downwards, she knew she had to find\u00a0a way out. This took time, which proved a crucial part of her learning process: she began to realise the importance of being patient with herself while accepting that other people around her might not be. For someone inherently battling to quash the people-pleasing part of themselves, it was tough. \u201cI don\u2019t like people looking at me with accusing eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cI can forgive people for sometimes giving in to this pressure because there\u2019s a whole team of people getting paid to make my album fly. If it isn\u2019t there, they don\u2019t have a job, but that\u2019s a heck of a burden to bear when you\u2019re trying to make a bit of art.\u201d\nWhile nobody was picking up the phone to Mvula, badgering her for new music, it was the hearsay, implications and fake smiles that troubled her the most. As someone who makes a living from her vivid imagination, she had dreamed up people outside the door with pitchforks and knives, waiting. \u201cIt was nightmarish but I believe it served me in making music that was harder to come by,\u201d she says.\nMvula takes me back to the day she wrote breakthrough single \u201cGreen Garden\u201d. She remembers waking up and staying in her pyjamas all day, writing the chilled, summery song and then dancing to it. From that picture of effortless joy, we travel together to an ex-boyfriend\u2019s apartment in wintery New York, around the time of her big afro. Mvula is sitting in front of her laptop, staring hopelessly at the screen before bashing keys and making a cacophony of weird sounds with her voice. \u201cI was reaching into the innermost parts of myself just trying to wee out a tiny bit of pee,\u201d she says, dropping yet another first-rate analogy. \u201cYou know when you really want to go to the loo and then only a tiny bit comes out and you think, \u2018But\u2026 the feeling was so huge! It was like that for a good few months.\u201d\nIt is the presentation of women as complex and multi-dimensional that Mvula hopes can be her \u201clittle responsibility\u201d in the music industry. \u201cI don\u2019t want to down the Beyonc\u00e9 brand because she\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9 "], "sport/football/european": ["Liverpool's Europa League final appearance and the Champions League final will be\u00a0free-to-air for UK-based users on YouTube, it has been announced.\nBT Sport, which has exclusive coverage of the two European tournaments, confirmed that the BT Sport Showcase channel will be streamed through YouTube to UK users, in addition to the games being screened on their own channels.\n\"By doing so, it will bring the matches within reach of millions of additional fans who do not yet subscribe to BT Sport,\" BT said in a statement.\nLiverpool take on Sevilla in their first European final for nine years on Wednesday 18 May while the Champions League final at the San Siro on Saturday 28 May will be a derby between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.\u00a0\nThe announcement comes amid reports that viewing figures for the tournaments have been disappointing in the first season of BT Sport's \u00a3897million contract.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPrior to this season, Sky Sports held the majority of the rights to the Champions League with one game per round being screened on free-to-air ITV.

And on the last day Barcelona plays with us and Madrid against Deportivo, who also secured the final day survival.\u201d\nSpeculation as to whether maletines will play a part in La Liga\u2019s deciding weekend is, nevertheless, rife in the Spanish media. \nFormer Osasuna midfielder and Spain international Jose Antonio Martin Dominguez, also known as Peton, admitted on the same day that he had received incentives as a player, telling football television show\u00a0", "Barcelona will cross La Liga's finish line first on Saturday if they beat Granada away, but any slip-up from Luis Suarez and company will mean - providing Real Madrid beat Deportivo de la Coru\u00f1a - it will be Gareth Bale celebrating on the pitch at the final whistle.\n\"If we don\u2019t win our match then we will have to look at what has happened in other games but if we win, we win the league,\" said Luis Enrique looking for his second straight La Liga crown, on Friday.\nHe also said he is not interested in the debate about how Bar\u00e7a will celebrate if they win the title. There had been plans for a short bus ride late on Saturday night but a Bruce Springsteen concert and the Spanish Grand Prix have put paid to that by stretching security sources to the point where the club have been advised against a double deck bus crawling slowly to the stadium past thousands of celebrating supporters.\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m only interested in winning the league the rest is secondary,\" the Bar\u00e7a coach said. \"Winning the league will be enough in itself\".

But such was the end of season dip in form that saw Real close the gap on the leaders from 12 to just one point it will now feel like one of their greater titles.\nThe fact that after 37 games, and have scored 217 goals between them, Real Madrid and Barcelona are still separated by a solitary point is testament to Madrid\u2019s capacity to hang on.

Nothing else is in our minds but to win the game. I cannot tell you how another club will perform.\u201d\nTalk all week in Spain has been of the possibility that Granada would receive some sort of cash incentive to topple the league leaders. Spanish football has a shadowy history of financial incentives paid to sides to encourage them to win their games on the final day.\n\"If you\u2019re paying them to win there\u2019s nothing wrong with it,\" has often been the justification for turning a blind eye to such payments and \u2018los maletines\u2019 (briefcases full of money) have been the talk of Spanish football in the build up to the most exciting final day of the season since 2009/10 when Barcelona held off Real Madrid in the final game by winning their last match.

It\u2019s stylish, glassy and glittering with sunlight, but also comfortable and thoughtful. And it meets such high eco-standards that its energy costs are half those of a much smaller house.\nToday, the borough of Lewisham is justly proud of it. Yet had the council\u2019s planners had their way in 2007-8, the house wouldn\u2019t exist.\nAs housing ideas become more ingenious, back gardens come under scrutiny as possible sites. However, great care needs to be taken to maintain wildlife and water drainage. The Coopers, then in their fifties, had a 100-yard back garden that sloped steeply down to a road. But there was a problem.\nTheir house was a Grade II*-listed Georgian Chinoiserie pavilion with a stunning, curved \u201cChinese\u201d roof embellished with copper horns, probably designed by William Chambers who designed both the Pagoda in Kew Gardens and Somerset House in the Strand, and was architecture tutor to George III. Extended in the 19th century, it was a revered local landmark.\nThe couple met in 1966, in Liverpool, as penniless students at Freshers Week. \u201cHe pushed straight past me to get to my best friend,\u201d smiles Caroline, now with a successful career. Nevertheless, they got together in 1967 and, via rented flats, then a little house in Woolwich, in 1991 bought The Pagoda in Blackheath.\nRun as a children\u2019s home, it had been unused as a family house since the Second World War. The 6,000sq ft property needed work when the Coopers bought it from the council. With their three children, Sam, now 41, Jess, 35, and Will, 32, they did it up and loved it.\nBut by 2007, says Caroline, \u201cthe children had gone, it was too big, we\u2019d always wanted a modern house, so it was now or never.\u201d\nThey were determined to stay in Blackheath, but couldn\u2019t find a plot. Then one day, architect Chris Wilkinson visited. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got a plot,\u201d he said, pointing at the garden.\nTwo years of negotiations followed, as they tried to persuade planners to let them build. Philip had set up Portland Homes, a niche developer, in 1983 and is a planning wizard. He knew that all access during and after the build would have to be from the lower road.\nThe Highways Agency told him that if the couple funded extra parking spaces, it wouldn\u2019t obstruct an application. Having done that, it took a further six months to get permission to remove an old, diseased horse chestnut tree from the middle of the site.\nPhilip then asked Sam, who by then was running his own architecture practice, to design their new house. \u201cI wanted to give him the greatest architectural gift I could.\u201d\nSam\u2019s high-spec butterfly-plan design uses the steep site brilliantly. The ground floor is tucked into the slope against a thick concrete retaining wall, with access via a sunny south-facing courtyard. It has three bedrooms and several bathrooms, each with a strong colour-scheme: \u201cI use loads of colour,\u201d says Caroline.\nAbove, via glass-sided stairs, is the open-plan living space, with floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors that lead out to the stylish garden. There\u2019s a snug at one end, all deep grey and vibrant reds, and at the other end, the sensational master bedroom has purple polished plaster walls that run right into the shower, and an egg bath.\nAt the heart of this dazzling living space, the bespoke kitchen island is Corian with a concrete slab cast slantwise on top. \u201cThe builder practised casting by making his dog a bath,\u201d says Philip. Two amazing double \u201ccupboards\u201d slide open to show bright yellow washing-up and food-preparation areas, one with a window. After use they tuck away behind sleek, white doors. Fabulous.\nThere\u2019s also space to put in a lift, should the couple ever need one. On the eco-front, Sam left no stone unturned. There\u2019s rainwater harvesting, sedum roofs, a heat-exchange unit, super-thick insulated walls and laminated windows. One clever trick among many is that the ceramic floor slabs in the kitchen continue outside, but ungrouted, so that rain drains into the harvesting tank below.\nA shoo-in with the planners, you might think. But no, for even though English Heritage and The Georgian Group supported the proposal, there were scores of objections and the planners rejected it. The couple appealed and were turned down.\nA new council was elected, so they resubmitted their plan, only for it to be rejected again. Undaunted, they appealed a second time and at that hearing, the inspector was an architect.\nA main objection was that the new house would obscure Chambers\u2019 masterpiece, but when the inspector noted that tall Leylandii were already in the way and the view would in fact be improved, permission was granted.\nThat was a long haul, but building took longer. The first builder didn\u2019t work out, meaning extra costs and delay.\nHaving begun in autumn 2011, work ended at the end of June 2014. To add insult to injury, no one wanted to buy the old house while there was a building site down the garden. But at last the old place sold, and the Coopers moved into their modernist dream home.\n\u201cWe had lived and breathed it for so long that it was exactly how we imagined it,\u201d says Caroline. Would they do it all again? At this, Philip gets a gleam in his eye \u2014 though it could be just a trick of the light.\nThe Pagoda: sold for \u00a33 million (minus the building plot)\nCost of building The Pavilion: \u00a31.6 million\nValue of The Pavilion now: an estimated \u00a34.5 million", "London designer \n\u00a0", "Changing our home interiors with the seasons is, naturally enough, encouraged by design brands. With spring\u2019s arrival comes a welter of fabulous cushions, throws, rugs and curtains to transform rooms from dark and cosy to light and fresh.\nAn easy way to do it is taking the homewares market by storm. Reversible fabrics and accessories were red hot at London Design Week in March, from companies including Fromental, Dedar and de Le Cuona. Dedar\u2019s new Dalie Papaveri Tulipani design takes the idea literally, inspired by the effect seen on the reverse side of a woven Jacquard fabric.\nCurtains given a tab-top or eyelet treatment can be simply turned around to give a new look to a sitting or dining room, where no lining is required. Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s Cabaret fabric, a fishnet-inspired design in 10 colourways, each inverted on the reverse, would be ideal for this, while de Le Cuona\u2019s painted Vintage Canvas is subtler.\nInterior designer Natalia Miyar, soon to open a South Kensington studio, is a big fan of reversible curtain fabric to inject different tones and depths. Letitia Taylor, head of newly launched Harrods Interiors, which stocks the Gaultier fabric, has another idea: \u201cI love the thought of using a reversible fabric to create a different look not just from season to season, but day to night, when the lights are on and the mood in the room changes.\u201d\nFor contrast cushions \u2014 proving popular with interior designers \u2014MiaFleur\u2019s come in contrasting plain linen, Arlo & Jacob\u2019s have a whimsical illustration on one side and a block colour on the other, and Apponyi Home\u2019s let you switch textures, from leather to cotton, linen or velvet.\nFashion designers Gaultier and Christian Lacroix both offer cushions juxtaposing glamorous, embellished prints with a neutral reverse, at Rockett St George and Harrods respectively. And reversible throws by fabric designers Eleanor Pritchard, Hem, Roger Oates and Liberty can be used to transform a bed or sofa, instantly changing the mood of a room.\n\u00a0"], "sport/general/boxing": ["The fight of the century is closer to happening after two developments in the last 24 hours.\nFirstly, legendary boxing trainer Freddie Roach revealed that UFC star Conor McGregor has approached him over training him\u00a0amidst fervent speculation that he will take on the currently retired Floyd Mayweather in what reports have suggested will the highest grossing bout in boxing history.\nBoth Mayweather and McGregor have left strong hints over the last few days that the fight will actually happen.\nMayweather has said that it is \"possible\", while McGregor posted a mocked-up image of the pair going head-to-head on his Twitter account.\nRoach, who has guided many boxers to world titles, admitted that McGregor's team have spoke to him, but refused to say it was solely for the potential Mayweather clash.\n\"'No [talk of Mayweather], just to train him,' Roach told Radio Rahim of BoxingScene.com.\u00a0\n\"They did ask me if I'll train him.

He pays exhaustive attention to everything from the haircuts to the cars, from the t-shirts to the sideburns, from the discos to the old computer games. Inevitably, music plays an absolutely crucial part in evoking the era. The eclectic soundtrack includes Stiff Little Fingers, Hot Chocolate, Van Halen (whose hard rock anthem gives\u00a0the film its title), Blondie and plenty of disco. At the same time, he is acutely observant of the mindset of the young would-be professional baseball players. They are all intensely competitive. Their will to win manifests itself in every aspect of their lives, from who uses the bathroom first to smoking the most dope and drinking the most beer; from casual games of table tennis to the ongoing battle\u00a0to pick up girls. Their swagger masks a basic insecurity. They're far more timid and inexperienced with women than they let on. They are also blithely deluded about their own abilities as potential baseball professionals. They may have been star players at high school but, in truth, only one or two have any chance of making the grade in the major leagues.\u00a0\nGenerally, in literature and in film as in real life itself, there is a great divide between the jocks and the bohemian, intellectual types. Linklater, though, is a director who straddles both worlds. As in almost all his films, and especially the ", "Woody Allen\u2019s latest feature, which opened the \nThe film is set in the 1930s. Jesse Eisenberg plays Bobby Dorfman, a naive young Jewish kid from the Bronx who heads out to Hollywood, hoping to make his fortune. His uncle Phil (Steve Carrell) is a hotshot agent who knows all the big shots, from Greta Garbo to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Allen sets the scene in a slightly croaky voice-over, and Thirties Los Angeles is lovingly and lavishly recreated in all its art deco glory.\nAs Allen fans know, the filmmaker doesn\u2019t much care for California. He can\u2019t resist a few satirical sideswipes at the narcissism and inanity of Hollywood celebrity culture, even in the golden age of the big studios. Bobby takes his time to find his feet in tinseltown. Things look up when he falls in love with his uncle\u2019s beautiful secretary Vonnie (Kristen Stewart). The hitch is that uncle Phil is in love with her too, even though he\u2019s ostensibly happily married.\nBobby is \u201chalf bored, half fascinated\u201d by the glitter of Hollywood and eventually decides that he will be much better off back in New York, where his gangster brother Ben (Corey Stoll) runs a nightclub.

Scripted by Loach\u2019s regular collaborator Paul Laverty, it is a melodramatic and sometimes very didactic film but also an intensely moving one.\u00a0\nDaniel Blake (Dave Johns) is a Newcastle joiner in late middle age who has had a heart attack. Warned by the doctor that he is not yet fit to return to work, he is obliged to sign on. He is dignified, self-reliant and full of compassion for others. To have to rely on benefits is deeply humiliating to him.\nEarly on, the film is perceptive and funny in its account of Daniel\u2019s quest to receive the allowance he needs to live. We\u2019re in a Kafkaesque world in which claimants who aren\u2019t fit to work have to spend over 30 hours a week applying for jobs they can\u2019t take in order to qualify for support. There are several reference to the Bedroom Tax. We see characters queuing for a small eternity to use food banks. Many of the people working in the job centre are casually cruel to applicants, seemingly oblivious to their desperation. When Daniel sees a young mother (Hayley Squires) being denied basic support for her selfand her two young kids because he is a few minutes late for her appointment, he intervenes on her behalf. This sparks an unlikely friendship between the 59-year-old Geordie and the young Londoner (who has come north in search of housing.)\nLoach makes some trenchant points about how little contemporary British society values the wisdom and experience of men like Daniel. He doesn\u2019t know how to use a computer or navigate his way around the internet. (There\u2019s a comic set-piece in which he struggles to master a computer mouse.) However, he is both a very proficient craftsman and someone with extraordinary gifts of empathy and kindness. He is someone who has always looked out for others and yet, at his time of need, society has no time for him whatsoever.\nThe film doesn\u2019t shirk from mawkishness. At times, with its references to prostitution, illness and homelessness, it has the air of a Victorian morality fable. Dave Johns gives a wonderful performance as Daniel, showing us the character\u2019s humour, mischief and resilience as well his determination never to feel sorry for himself or to provoke pity in others. Loach ends the movie a little awkwardly with a set-piece speech that feels contrived. At 80, though, the director hasn\u2019t lost his knack for telling stories about marginalised characters with wit, anger and humanity.", "There is a lot of windy popping going on in Spielberg\u2019s live action adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s \nFor all its technical excellence and \u00a0surrealistic flights of fancy, this isn\u2019t Spielberg at full throttle.

The Department of Health said the report had not properly taken account of increases in the NHS workforce since 2010.\u00a0\nBut Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC, said there were \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the Government\u2019s approach to staffing the NHS and said that, without urgent action, the public would soon pay the price with higher waiting times and greater costs to taxpayers.\u00a0\n\u201cTaxpayers are being asked to accept uncosted plans for a seven-day NHS \u2013 plans which therefore present a further serious risk to public money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt beggars belief that such a major policy should be advanced with so flimsy a notion of how it will be funded \u2013 namely, from money earmarked to cover all additional spending in the NHS to the end of the decade.\u00a0\n\u201cTaxpayers are entitled to ask questions about the financial security of the NHS and the level of service it is able to provide both now and in the future.\u201d\nThe report cited figures from a recent National Audit Office analysis that indicated that, in 2014, the NHS had a staffing shortfall of around 6 per cent \u2013 the equivalent of around 50,000 clinical staff.\u00a0\nIt criticised the Department of Health for assuming that the \u00a310bn pledge could \u201ccover everything\u201d, while warning that the simultaneous requirement on NHS England to cut \u00a322bn from its budget by 2020 was leading to \u201coverly optimistic and aggressive\u201d rota planning in hospitals, which in turn was creating staffing shortages. The savings targets set by national bodies were \u201cunrealistic\u201d the report said.\u00a0\nThe undersupply of staff would hit patient trust in the health service, it added, and could lead to longer waiting times and shortcomings in care quality.\u00a0\nDr Mark Porter, chair of council at the British Medical Association, the union embroiled in a long-running dispute with the Government over the new junior doctor contract, said the situation was \u201conly set to get worse\u201d.\n\u201cThe BMA is clear that patients should have access to the same high quality of care, seven days a week, but if the Government wants more seven-day services, then it must finally answer the question asked by doctors, senior NHS leaders, medical royal colleges and now the Public Accounts Committee: how will it staff and fund them?\u201d he said.\u00a0\nShadow Health Minister, Justin Madders, said: \u201cThis devastating report from the Public Accounts Committee exposes the serious gaps in the Tory Government\u2019s approach to safe staffing in the NHS.

By March next year, we will provide a quarter of the population with seven-day care.\u201d\nThe PAC report was published as two new studies cast doubt on the evidence for a weekend effect on hospital mortality. The papers, published in The Lancet, indicated that the any link between weekend staffing levels and mortality rates could be a \u201c major oversimplification\u201d, experts said.\u00a0\nThe first paper, by researchers at the University of Birmingham, found no association between senior doctor staffing levels at the weekend and mortality rates.

They spend no more than two years in any single part of the Treasury. They have no collective memory for any agreement or decision that had been taken before they arrived at their desks.\n\"Everything is up for grabs immediately someone new moves in and they dictate every single policy area across government. It is a fight at all stages.\"\nMr Duncan Smith said that the Treasury's power over Whitehall was established under Labour chancellor Gordon Brown, leaving it with \"enormous\" power over other departments.\nThe kind of decisions made in countries such as Germany and the US to support industry were \"very difficult\" in the UK because of the Treasury's dominance, he said. \"It's not a department that is characterised by the concept of vision,\" he said. \"This is a department that is characterised solely by a lack of vision.\"", "The former chair of the \nIn comments that appear\u00a0to reinforce recent criticisms of the \nHe added that the Charter Renewal process had \u201ccertainly led to very real suspicions that ministers want to get much closer to the BBC\u201d.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One programme he said: \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in feeling that the BBC has sought to hedge its bets of late. There have been some quite extraordinary attacks on the elected leader of the Labour Party. I mean quite extraordinary. I can understand why people are worried about whether some of the most senior editorial voices at the BBC have lost their impartiality in this.\u201d\n\u201cAll I\u2019m voicing is the anxieties that have been expressed publicly by others,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nCriticisms of the BBC among some of Mr Corbyn\u2019s supporters have escalated since last week\u2019s local elections. A petition was launched calling for political editor Laura Kuenssberg to be sacked, but later taken down by 38 Degrees after it became a focal point for what the campaign group\u2019s executive director called \u201csexist and hateful abuse\u201d.\u00a0\nTony Hall, the BBC\u2019s director general, also speaking to the World at One, called Sir Michael\u2019s claim \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the journalism I know or the journalists in this organisation I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the journalism of the BBC is impartial.

The independent Trident Commission estimated in 2014 that the system would have a lifetime cost of around \u00a3100 billion.\nLast year an estimate published by Reuters and derived from figures obtained by Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee chair Crispin Blunt put the cost of the system at \u00a3167 billion.\u00a0\nMinisters believe the cost of four new submarines would be \u00a331\u00a0billion but have been reticent to put an exact figure on the full lifetime cost of the system.\nKate Hudson, CND general secretary, said: \u201cThese new calculations, drawn from actual government figures, show that the bill has spiralled beyond all expectations.\u201d\nCaroline Lucas, the Green Party MP who chairs CND\u2019s parliamentary group, said replacing the weapons system was \u201cneither necessary nor sensible\u201d.\n\u201cThe eye watering cost of replacing this cold war relic now stands at up to \u00a3205bn. Not only is this a colossal waste of resources but I fear that ploughing these huge sums of money into Trident will make us less safe, not more.\n\u201cNuclear missiles have the potential to cause devastation and death on an unimaginable scale, but they do nothing to hinder lone gunmen or extremists. Their very presence in Britain \u2013 and the transport of nuclear warheads on our roads \u2013 presents not only a target for terrorism but a continued risk of accidents linked to human error or technical failure.\n\u201cReplacing Trident is neither necessary nor sensible. The evidence \u2013 provided by senior ex-military figures among others - is stacked against spending billions of pounds on these exceptionally dangerous weapons.\n\u201cParliament will soon choose whether to join the vast majority of nuclear-free nations by moving on from Trident. MPs should be thinking long and hard about whether they want to commit the UK to spending up to \u00a3205bn on this weapons system. When the vote comes I hope that a majority will join me in voting against Trident renewal.\u201d\nLabour MP John Woodcock, a long-time defender of Trident\u00a0in whose consituency the replacement submarines would be built, said the figures were misleading and that it was wrong to include associated costs in the estimate.\n\u201cThe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has created a major industry churning out ever more fanciful figures about the programme to replace the UK's nuclear submarines\n\u201cNo other public project is calculated in remotely the same misleading way - CND's latest punt is the equivalent of inflating the figure for building a new hospital by including the salaries of every doctor, nurse and porter who works in it through its life, the electricity to power its equipment and the cost of literally anything else you could think to chuck in over a 50 year period.\n\u201cThe truth is that Trident renewal will cost a tiny fraction of the amount we spend on either defence, education or health over the lifetime of the system and will help guard against future insecurity while anchoring in UK communities many thousands of irreplaceable advanced manufacturing jobs.\"\nParliament is set to vote on whether to renew Trident when the current system comes to the end of its operational life\u00a0\u2013 with the issue likely to reopen deep splits in the Labour party between those in favour of and against the weapons.\u00a0\nIn February it was reported that the vote had been delayed until after the European Union referendum, which will take place on 23 June this year.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn is opposed to the system \u2013 but there have been suggestions that he could offer his party a free vote on the issue.\nHe caused a row last year when he said he would not use the weapons system because doing so would likely lead to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians being killed. David Cameron said he would however use the bombs.\nMinister for Defence Procurement, Philip Dunne said: \"This is more fiction dressed up as fact from known opponents of the strategic deterrent. We do not recognise these figures. We have been clear on the cost estimates published on the Successor submarine. We are replacing the submarines and that cost equates to 20 pence in every \u00a3100 of annual government spending. The in-service costs remain unchanged - around 6 per cent\u00a0of the Annual Defence budget.\"", "The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney,\u00a0warned today that a\u00a0majority vote to \"leave\" in next month's European Union referendum carried the risk of a \"technical recession\" for the UK.\nHis words came as the Bank slashed its growth forecasts citing uncertainty created by next month's Brexit referendum - and warned, in addition,\u00a0that a vote to leave could push up unemployment, send the pound plummeting and result in a spike in inflation.\nThe Bank said that GDP in the second quarter of the year would dip to just 0.3 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year as businesses and households reined in their spending ahead of the poll.\nOverall GDP growth this year is now seen as coming in at 2 per cent, down from the Bank's previous forecast of 2.2 per cent in February's forecasts.\u00a0\nAnnual growth in both 2017 and 2018 is forecast to be 2.3 per cent, down from 2.4 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively.\nYet the Bank's forecasts are all predicated on Britain voting to remain in the European Union in the 23 June poll.\nIt stressed\u00a0the economic impact of a vote to leave would be strongly negative in the short-term, implying that growth considerably undershoot even today's downgraded forecasts and possibly compel an emergency reduction in interest rates from the Bank.\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession,\" said Mr Carney at a press conference. A technical recession refers to two consecutive quarters of contraction in GDP.\nThe Governor's\u00a0words were seized upon by the Remain campaign as further ammunition in their campaign to persuade voters that Brexit would make them worse off. The Chancellor, George Osborne,\u00a0said the Bank's words showed that Brexit was a \"lose-lose situation for Britain, Either way we'd be poorer\".\nThe Bank did not produce any detailed forecasts for the economic damage resulting from Brexit. But \nThe Bank estimates that around half of that fall is due to due to traders' uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum.\nNeither the Leave or Remain sides have opened up a strong lead in the opinion polls.\nThe Bank warned that a leave vote could force the MPC into a tough trade off between raising rates to bring down inflation and cutting them to support growth.\n\u201cWhatever the outcome of the referendum and its consequences, the MPC will take whatever action is needed to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and inflation returns to the target over the appropriate horizon\u201d it said.\nThe Bank said the MPC had held a joint meeting with its Financial Policy Committee counterpart on 6 April to discuss \u201crisks to monetary and financial stability\u201d associated with the referendum.\nIt said a Brexit could result in a sharp drop in the willingness of foreigners to invest in British assets and \u201cpose a major financing difficulty for the United Kingdom\u201d.\nThe MPC voted unanimously today to keep interest rates on hold at their record low levels of 0.5 per cent, where they have been since 2009.\nAssuming no Brexit, the Bank said \u201cspare capacity\u201d in the UK economy was likely to be eliminated \u00a0\u201cearly next year\u201d.\u00a0\nSenior members of the Bank have. in the past. suggested that it will put up Bank rate before spare capacity is exhausted.\u00a0\nBut financial market are not pricing in an increase in the Bank rate until 2018 at the earliest.\nSome MPC members have publicly mooted the possibility of a further Bank rate cut if the economy stutters, even in the absence of Brexit.\nBut the Bank said today: \u201cThe MPC judges that it is more likely than not that Bank rate will need to be higher by the end of the forecast period than at present to ensure inflation returns to the target in a sustainable manner.\u201d", "Sadiq Khan has accused Jeremy Corbyn of failing to \u201ccall out\u201d antisemitism within the party\u2019s ranks, in what appears to be the third attack on the Labour leader in his first week as mayor of London.\nMr Khan, who started at City Hall on Monday, made his comments just weeks after a row over antisemitism in the party dominated headlines before the local elections.

The election brought few surprises, beyond slight gains in smaller parties, and the traditional parties have returned with largely the same vote share. But in many ways, the parliament\u2019s composition is undergoing a subtle but seismic shift. The number of female politicians sitting at Stormont will now be 50 per cent more than that of the previous parliament. In one of the most traditional corners of the UK, a quiet but undeniable revolution has occurred.\nSince power-sharing was devolved to Northern Ireland, the region has always lagged behind its sister parliaments in London, Holyrood and Cardiff and has borne the unfortunate mantle of having one of the lowest levels of female political representation of anywhere in Western Europe. The reasons for this are many and complex; traditional religious views of gender have prevailed and shaped conservative cultural attitudes.\u00a0A core principle of the peace-process was that people involved in The Troubles era politics had to be given parliamentary seats and as women were much less likely to be involved in violence, they were essentially excluded from the peace process as negotiators felt less of an impetus to include them.\nStormont\u2019s \u2018women problem\u2019 was encapsulated when Ian Paisely Junior insisted on shouting \u2018moo moo moo\u2019 to mimic a cow when members of the Northern Ireland Woman\u2019s Coalition spoke in peace process talks in an attempt to drown out their voices.\nJust eighteen years on, Stormont appears to be finally breaking free of some of that political baggage. Traditional religious views are relaxing and the violent legacy of the Troubles is becoming less and less a formative force in day-to-day politics. Following Democratic Unionist Peter Robinson\u2019s resignation as party leader and First Minister, his deputy Arlene Foster became the first woman to take either role in January. This parliament, \nOf course, this is a long way off 50 per cent equal representation and still hangs behind the Scottish parliament (with 35 per cent women) and the Welsh parliament (with 43\u00a0per cent women in the Assembly and 48 per cent of constituency seats), but surpassed even the most optimistic predictions locally.\nDanielle Roberts, PHD student at\u00a0Ulster University and member of the Belfast Feminist Network, says the barriers which have been holding women back historically are changing: \u201cA recent report produced by the Assembly highlighted the adversarial nature of Stormont and also highlighted sexism in the chamber. Both communities have traditionally had socially conservative views of women and their role in society, tending to see women as generally suited for support roles rather than decision making ones- however, this is changing.\n\u201cWomen who ran were statistically more likely to get elected than men in 2011 as well as 2016, notably every one of the eight women candidates run by the Democratic Unionist Party this year was returned. In previous elections there simply weren\u2019t as many women to vote for.\u201d\nShe adds that she is reluctant to say whether a greater presence of female MLAs could result in a different laws or policies emerging, including on the controversial abortion ban which is still in place in Northern Ireland, explaining: \u201cWomen are not a homogenous group, so it would be wrong to say that more women automatically results in a greater focus on what may be termed \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019, however it does mean different views and experiences are brought to the table.\u201d\nMary Hassan, a local election candidate for the Green Party in the recent election, says watching out of touch politicians at Stormont repeatedly vote against marriage equality for same-sex couples was the cause which propelled her decision to stand: \u201cThe traditional \u2018pale, male, stale\u2019 politician we are used to seeing in Stormont is getting very tired. I didn't feel represented as a young, gay woman and I was sure others felt the same way. You can't imagine how frustrating or how strange it feels to watch a group of overwhelmingly male, heterosexual people vote five times over on whether or not I as a gay woman should be afforded the same rights as everyone else, to have nobody whose life experience or identity reflects mine there on the floor to make the case that needed to be made. It crushed me. This was so personal and so painful, and yet it was treated as a political football.\u201d\nShe adds that any suggestion that female election candidates run as \u2018tokens\u2019 rather than serious competitors couldn\u2019t be further than the truth: \u201cThe Green Party contacted me after hearing about my activism on LGBT issues. They had seen what I had been doing alone and wanted to give me a platform to keep doing it. This wasn\u2019t a case of tokenism and that\u2019s what mattered to me. Every single Green Party candidate this election had a phenomenal breadth of knowledge and experience and I was very proud to stand among them.\u201d\nHowever, while she welcomes progress so far, Hassan says: \u201cthe pace of change can feel glacial. I\u2019d like to see quotas in place or a more radical position taken to bring Northern Ireland more in line with the rest of Europe.

Some Labour MPs have even raised the prospect he could face a leadership challenge after a Brexit vote, as he would get the blame. But others insist the Labour leader is safe for a year.\nIn an interview with \nThe MP for Batley and Spen said: \u201cWhatever the outcome of the referendum, there will be huge implications for both the Conservative and Labour parties.\u201d Asked if a Brexit vote could provoke a Labour leadership contest, Ms Cox replied: \u201cI want to see those Labour voters come out and vote Remain. If they don\u2019t, and we leave [the EU], that is a conversation for 24 June.\u201d\nShe said Mr Corbyn, as a sceptic about some aspects of the EU, had a \u201cunique voice\u201d and must \u00a0deploy it \u201cwith gusto.\u201d\nThere are fears in the Remain camp that, although Mr Corbyn launched Labour\u2019s pro-EU campaign this week, he will not follow it up with regular appearances and speeches over the next six weeks. With the opinion polls next and neck, and a majority of Conservative supporters likely to back Brexit, Remain is desperate to win Labour voters. Mr Corbyn voted to leave the EU in the 1975 referendum and there are fears that a lukewarm endorsement of membership by him now would not persuade Labour supporters to vote to stay.\nOne Labour frontbencher said: \u201cIf the public vote to leave the EU, Labour will get the blame.\u201d Another said: \u201cThe finger would be pointed at Jeremy and there could be consequences.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, other senior Labour figures dismissed the prospect of a leadership challenge after a Brexit vote. \u00a0One Shadow Cabinet member said: \u201cJeremy is safe for a year. We should get behind him now. If the Tories are tearing themselves apart and trying to get rid of Cameron, why on earth would we do the same? It would be madness.\u201d Corbyn allies insist he is fully committed to Britain remaining in the EU. They will be dismayed that Labour MPs are setting yet another \u00a0test for him only four days after he appealed to them for unity.\nIn her interview, Ms Cox also urged the Labour leader to take a tougher line against supporters who attack his critics on social media. She said: \u201cThese people do speak in his name. Jeremy has said repeatedly he doesn\u2019t sanction this kind of behaviour. But I think has to do a little bit more to make it clear that this is not in his name. It does him a disservice because it is not the gentler kind of politics he stands for.\u201d\nMs Cox, 41, who has received sexist comments and remarks about her appearance on social media after criticising Mr Corbyn, said: \u201cWe have got to be able to have debates that do not descend into vile attacks or abuse. It should be OK for people to put their head above the parapet in the Labour Party in a fair and moderate way without being mowed down for that. There are definitely misogynistic trends and themes, an aggressive, patronising and slightly sexist tone to some of the messages I get.\u201d\nShe defended Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC\u2019s Political Editor, who was the victim of sexist abuse after an online petition called for her to be sacked over her reports on last week\u2019s election results. \u201cShe did a good job. This is offensive. There is a strand of people involved in the Labour movement who go way too far in attacking anyone who has a different view to them,\u201d she said.\n\u00a0Ms Cox hinted that Mr Corbyn should stand down voluntarily as leader if he fails to broaden Labour\u2019s appeal to make it look like an alternative government. \u201cEveryone is committed to making it work. \u00a0If it does not, ultimately there are many of us who think that Jeremy needs to take responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he can convince the British public that he is a prime minister-in-waiting, I will be the first to back him. If he can\u2019t, then he needs to reflect on that.\n\u201cThe clock is ticking. If we don\u2019t change tack, many Labour MPs will not be Labour MPs after the 2020 election. It is not just Jeremy; we are all on probation.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0The former aid worker, who was elected to Parliament a year ago, now regrets nominating Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership in order to widen the party\u2019s debate. She did not want him to win and voted for Liz Kendall. \u00a0\u201cI do regret it. I wanted the leadership campaign to be broad and inclusive, a real debate,\u201d she said. \u201c I wanted Jeremy to listen to that and not just talk about things that those who voted for him wanted to talk about. I have not seen enough of that broader conversation.\u201d\nMs Cox said Mr Corbyn \u201cpersonally needed to act faster and go much further\u201d in tackling anti-Semitism in the party. She claimed several Labour MPs wrote to him some weeks before the controversy erupted \u00a0but got no response. She argued that Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended by Labour after suggesting that Hitler was a Zionist, should be expelled permanently. \u00a0She said: \u201cI think it is time for Ken to leave the party. It would be very difficult for members to accept him back after what he said.\u201d\n\u00a0Ms Cox, who describes herself as \u201con the left of the party\u201d and \u201cdefinitely not a Blairite\u201d, said: \u201cJeremy needs to accept that we are trying to be critical friends. We need a really inclusive message that reaches out beyond the Labour Party\u2019s base. Some of the people around him are very good at talking to the movement that helped propel Jeremy to power in the party \u2013 a really important constituency who are passionate, principled and excited.

The reports are undertaken by the government when a benefit claimant\u2019s death appears to be \u201cassociated with DWP activity\u201d. There is no suggestion that the DWP is responsible for the deaths.\n49 reports have been released from February 2012 and August 2014, of which 40 are understood to relate to a person who has died as a result of suicide. Findings include that Department staff did not always follow guidelines when dealing with vulnerable people and reportedly often had issues with poor communication or rigidly sticking to policies rather than showing flexibility or common sense approaches.\nA report into one death states: \u201cWe need to ask whether or not in the context of fast-moving environment of high [claimant re-assessment] volumes and anticipated levels of performance, the current process requires, encourages and supports\u2026 colleagues to independently and systematically consider claimant vulnerability.\u201d\nAnother says: \u201cThis case may highlight a dislocation between policy intent and what actually happens to claimants who are vulnerable.\u201d\nIn two cases investigators reportedly state that their inquiries were impaired as DWP records had been destroyed or were missing.\nIn August, following a lengthy process, the Department was ordered by the Information Commissioner to reveal data stipulating the number of people who have died after being found fit for work. Records showed 2,380 people died between December 2011 and February 2014 after their claim for employment support allowance ended for this reason. The Department deny welfare reforms were in any way responsible for the deaths and say no causal link can be identified between benefits cuts and mortality rates.\nIn response to concerns highlighted in the \u2018peer review\u2019 reports, a spokesperson for the DWP told The Independent: \u202a\u201dPeer reviews help staff to continually improve how they deal with some of the most complex and challenging cases, and represent a very small percentage of the benefit claims DWP handles.\n\u201cWe provide guidance to staff on how best to support vulnerable claimants. Any suicide is a tragedy and the reasons for them are complex, however it would be inaccurate and misleading to link it solely to a person\u2019s benefit claim.\n\u201cWe spend around \u00a380bn a year on working age benefits to provide a safety net for some of the most vulnerable people in society.\u201d", "Isolated campaign victories won in opposition are no substitute for a Labour government when it comes to bringing about real social change, Jeremy Corbyn has said.\nSpeaking at the annual conference of the New Labour pressure group Progress Mr Corbyn listed a string of recent campaign victories achieved under his leadership -- but said only Labour victory at a general election could genuinely change the country.\nHe warned that \"no matter how many\" isolated campaigns were successful, the party would need to win a majority in parliament to do its job properly.\n\"It's been said the Labour movement improves people people's lives when we win elections: that's absolutely true, we have to win elections, we have to fight as hard as we can,\" he said.\n\"No matter how many campaigning we win -- and we have won a few, and I hope we'll win quite a few more as time goes on -- the reality is we don't have a majority in Parliament, we don't have a Labour government.\n\"I want us to have that and to win that in 2020 or if David Cameron feels like it we could have it a bit sooner.\"\nThe leader's statement echoes the rhetoric and claims of his critics, who say Mr Corbyn isn't doing enough to win the next election in 2020.\nMPs associated with Progress have been amongst Mr Corbyn's chief internal detractors since he was elected as leader in September 2015 -- and the leader's appearance today was made in front of a potentially tough crowd.\nDespite the venue the Labour leader however avoided any embarrassing incidents, with delegates politely applauding during his speech and no heckling.\nHe noted that despite having been an MP since the 1980s this was the first time he had attended the gathering, which is closely associated with the party's New Labour wing, including Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. \u00a0\nMr Corbyn was thanked for his appearance by Alison McGoven, the Labour MP who chairs Progress. She said she valued the Labour leader's commitment to open debate in the party despite wider disagreements.\nTaking questions from the audience after a speech, Mr Corbyn assured worried Labour supporters that he was doing all he could to tackle the recent row over alleged antisemitism in the party.\n\"Antisemitism is wrong and has to be totally opposed and totally defeated, period,\" he said, adding that he would support a party rule change to make it clear Labour was \"absolutely a totally anti racist\" organisation.\nRumblings of a leadership coup by hostile against Mr Corbyn have moved into the background since this month's set of local elections, where Labour achieved a better than expected result.\nThe Islington MP however told Progress delegates that the result was \"not good enough\" and that the party needed to do more to win in 2020.\nHe said the party was launching a review into how the party could reach out to workers left behind by previous policies, including the self-employed and private sector workers.\nThe Government has U-turned on a number of key policies since Mr Corbyn came to power -- including tax credit cuts, disability benefit cuts, and the forced academisation of schools.\u00a0\nWhile the Government has faced significant opposition from its own MPs on all those measures, Labour has also stood opposed and isolated the Tory leadership, with Mr Corbyn claiming some credit for the victories.\nLabour came third in the Scottish Parliament elections for the first time earlier this month, losing second place to a resurgent Tory party led by MSP Ruth Davidon.\u00a0\nIt however remained by far the largest party in Wales and retained many key marginal councils in the south of England, where the party has to do well to win a majority.\nThe party also won significant victories in urban centres such as London and Bristol, where it captured mayoralties it had previously lacked.\u00a0", "David Cameron has hammered home the economic arguments for remaining in the European Union \u2013 as politicians and activists of the main Remain-supporting parties stage a day of action to save Britain\u2019s membership of the bloc.\u00a0\nThe Prime Minister unveiled\u00a0a poster bearing the Treasury\u2019s claim that every family would be \u00a34,300 worse off in the event of Brexit and warned that a vote to leave the EU could tip the British economy back into recession.\nA recession would be the \"last thing our economy needs,\" Mr Cameron said.\nMr Cameron also\nAlso on Saturday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will lay out his vision for remaining in the EU in a speech at the QEII centre in Westminster, London, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron will lead a campaign in Kendall\u00a0and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas will make her case in Brighton.\nMr Corbyn in particular is stepping up after having been urged by some of his MPs to take a greater role in defending membership of the EU.\nJo Cox, Labour MP for\u00a0Batley and Spen,\u00a0yesterday told \nThe Labour leader yesterday urged young people to register to vote for the referendum, warning that those who neglected to do so would be left with \u201cno voice\u201d.\nIn total, Remain campaigners say they will be staging 1,000 events led by around 6,200 campaigners from Britain Stronger in Europe. The campaign\u2019s organisers hope the push will help their side open up a lead in the polls \u2013 which have been stubbornly close in recent months.\nMr Cameron sought to emphasise the cross-party nature of the campaign in his speech on Saturday\u00a0\u2013 a risky strategy reminiscent of some aspects of the Better Together approach during the Scottish Independence Referendum.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see the effects of this referendum in our lives: the jobs we do, the opportunities our children have, the public services we rely on, the prices we pay, and the bills that land on our doormats,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is a day unlike any other: politicians of every stripe taking to the streets with the same message. Because we face a vote unlike any other, one which will shape our country for decades \u2013 even generations \u2013 to come,\" Mr Cameron said.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is bigger than party politics. Its effects will last longer than our lifetimes.

Murray, who plays his first match here at the Rome Masters on Wednesday,\u00a0is looking for a new coach after announcing that he has parted company with \nMurray pointed out that Stefan Edberg had stopped working with Roger Federer at the end of last year because he wanted to spend more time at home and that Carlos Moya and Michael Chang, who work with Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori respectively, both limit the number of tournaments they attend.\nThe world No 3 said it had been important to him to bring Jamie Delgado into his coaching team this year. Delgado has committed to travelling for up to 40 weeks of the year with Murray.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to find that, especially if you\u2019re going for the ex-players who have spent 15 or 20 years of their life on the road for 30 or 35 weeks a year,\u201d Murray said here in Rome. \u201cThey don\u2019t always want to do it.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI do think it\u2019s important to have someone in your team who is willing to commit for that amount of time. To have that consistency throughout the whole of the year is very important. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got that now, which I didn\u2019t last year with Jonas [Bjorkman] and Am\u00e9lie. They were splitting the time. So I\u2019m happy I have that consistency and now I\u2019ll maybe try and find someone to add to that.\u201d\nAlthough Murray had spent only 10 days working with Mauresmo since the end of January, he admitted that the schedule he had agreed with her would have seen them spend a lot of time together between now and the end of Wimbledon.\nHad he therefore considered extending the relationship with her at least until the middle of the summer? \u201cWe spoke about that last week,\u201d Murray said. \u00a0\u201cThe problem is that the same thing was going to continue happening throughout the year. So after Wimbledon it was going to happen and then after the US Open.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cYou simply need more time than that to make an impact and make a difference, in my opinion - and in Am\u00e9lie\u2019s opinion as well. We both agreed on that, and that was it. We certainly could have tried through to the end of Wimbledon, but longer term and medium term the same thing was going to continue happening. It just made more sense to stop now.\u201d\nMurray rejected any suggestion that the fact he and Mauresmo had parted company had struck a blow against the idea of women coaching men in tennis.\u00a0\u201cI think it did work,\u201d Murray said. \u201cFor two years I think the results that we had were good. Maybe unless I win a Grand Slam, then maybe ultimately that\u2019s how people may judge whether it worked or not, but when she first came into the team, I was really struggling. I was not doing well. My confidence was low and I was going in the wrong direction.\n\u201cThen obviously when she came on board, my results really picked up. For me, the time we spent together was positive. It\u2019s just a shame I wasn\u2019t able to win one of the major events, because that\u2019s what both of us wanted.\u201d\nMurray pointed out that \u201cno one batted an eyelid\u201d about Edberg ending his relationship with Federer because the Swede did not want to travel as much. \u201cSo in my opinion it's nothing to do with Am\u00e9lie being a woman,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the case for a lot of the ex-players that it takes a lot of time to do the job well and properly. It\u2019s not easy to do that for four, five years in a row.\u201d\nHe said that the end of 2014, following Mauresmo\u2019s appointment earlier in the year, had been a difficult time for both of them. Although he had qualified for the season-ending Barclays ATP World Tour Finals by picking up ranking points at smaller tournaments, his year ended with a crushing defeat by Roger Federer at the O2 Arena.\n\u201cThere were a lot of questions asked of me at the end of that year after how the O2 finished and also of her,\u201d Murray said, \u201cI don't think many people had any confidence really in that partnership after how that year ended.\u00a0But when it was decided that we were going to go for it together, I think it gave both of us a lift. I think when I showed the confidence in her, she was really passionate and pumped and really wanted to make it work. It was the same for me when she also stuck by me, as did all those members of my team who are still with me now.\n\u201cIt was like: \u2018Right, OK, we\u2019re going to show everyone we're a strong team.\u2019 We came back after that and I played what I think was maybe my best Australian Open. I played extremely well there and came back well from how I finished [the previous] year.\n\u201cIt took a lot of hard work on the court and a lot of chatting and talking about the things I needed to work on, being very open about my weaknesses. Because it was clear at the end of that year after my match with Roger that there were a lot of them. Even though I was winning matches at other levels I wasn\u2019t at that level and was nowhere close to doing it. It took a lot of hard work to get back to a level where I\u2019m competing with the best players again.\u201d\nMurray has dropped to No 3 in the world rankings but has a good chance to reclaim the No 2 position this week from Federer, who has 600 ranking points to defend here as last year\u2019s runner-up. \u00a0Murray is defending only 90 points after withdrawing from the tournament last year before his third-round match because of tiredness.\u00a0The Scot said he had not worked out exactly what he needed to do this week in order to return to No 2 in time for the French Open, which starts in 12 days\u2019 time. Being seeded No 2 would mean that Murray could not face Novak Djokovic, the world No 1, before the final.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not essential,\u201d Murray, ", "Heather Watson still has work to do if she is to achieve her main goal of 2016. The 23-year-old Briton has set her heart on playing at this summer\u2019s Olympic Games but after losing 6-4, 6-2 to Barbora Strycova in the second round here her place in the field for Rio is still in some doubt.\nA ranking inside the world\u2019s top 60 by the end of the French Open should be enough to secure Watson\u2019s Olympic place, but the world No 55 could yet be overtaken by the cut-off date. Although she has successfully defended the ranking points she won in Rome last year, she might still need to garner more points in Strasbourg next week and at the French Open, which begins in 11 days\u2019 time. She has points to defend in Paris, having reached the second round there last year.\nWatson said that one of the reasons she will play next week is the chance to earn more ranking points, though it will also be an opportunity to get more clay-court matches under her belt. \u201cThe more matches the better,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that I always play better with more matches.\u201d\nAfter the glorious sunshine of previous days the skies were overcast following overnight rain. \u00a0Watson had won her previous meeting with Strycova, in the first round of the French Open two years ago, but the world No 36 is a feisty competitor.\nStrycova, aged 30, achieved her highest world ranking position of No 20 last year. She is one of the most consistent performers on the women\u2019s tour, having finished the season in the world\u2019s top 100 for the last eight years in succession.\nEverything seemed straightforward for Watson when she dropped only three points in the first three games. The Briton raced into a 4-0 lead, but Strycova quickly fought back. The Czech soon levelled at 4-4 and then saved two game points in the following game before breaking Watson for the third time in a row. After 53 minutes she served out for the set.\nWatson, who saved only two of the eight break points she defended in the match, was soon 4-1 down in the second set. A break back to 4-2 briefly raised hopes of a revival, but Strycova quickly regained control to close out victory after an hour and 29 minutes, having won 12 of the last 14 games.\n\u201cI felt pretty flawless at the beginning, and then I remember being 40-15 up at 4-0 and she changed her game, started hitting a few loopy balls, which was smart,\u201d Watson said afterwards. \u201cI thought after that my level dropped a bit, but I also thought she improved a lot from there.\n\u201cI still had my chances to close to 4-4, but I thought that from then on she just played very well. Her balls were very deep and every time I'd set myself up in a point she'd just put the ball in a really awkward position for me.\u201d\nWatson added: \u201cThe good thing is I have had a lot of matches and I'm feeling very comfortable on the clay now. I would have loved to have gone further here, because I felt like I was playing great, but I'll take the positives and hopefully I can have another good week before the French.\u201d\nVictoria Azarenka, who has been the form player of the women\u2019s tour this year, lost her opening match, going down 6-3, 6-2 to Romania\u2019s Irina-Camelia Begu, the world No 35. Azarenka had established herself as one of the favourites for the French Open after winning titles in Brisbane, Indian Wells and Miami, but she has had a poor start to the clay-court season, which has often been her most challenging part of the year.\nHaving pulled out of last week\u2019s Madrid tournament before her third-round match because of a lower back injury, the world No 6 never got going here and again appeared to be struggling physically.\n\u201cI thought I was OK and was ready to play and come back, so I\u2019m just disappointed,\u201d Azarenka said afterwards. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that I can\u2019t play my best tennis.\u201d\nAsked if she felt she was ready for the French Open, the former world No 1 said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. I\u2019m not going to think about the future.\u201d\nGarbine Muguruza, last year\u2019s Wimbledon runner-up, wasted no time winning her opening match. The Spaniard dropped only four points on her serve in in beating Russia\u2019s Ekaterina Makarova 6-1, 6-0 in just 47 minutes.", "Andy Murray took a step towards recapturing the world No 2 ranking from Roger Federer, but the 34-year-old Swiss has bigger issues on his mind this week. While Murray was beating Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3, 6-3 in his first match here at the Rome Masters Federer was also getting off to a winning start, but said after his 6-3, 7-5 victory over Alexander Zverev that his back injury was still giving him major cause for concern.\nFederer pulled out of last week\u2019s Madrid Masters because of his back problem in what is proving to be a particularly testing year. He had knee surgery in February, pulled out of the Miami Masters in March because of illness and is playing this week in only his second tournament since the end of January.\n\u201cI was expecting to lose in straight sets today,\u201d Federer admitted after his victory over Zverev. \u201cThat was the mindset going in, so to win in straights is actually a really big surprise to me. I played cautiously. I only decided after the warm-up that I was actually going to play, so for me it was a big match on many levels.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThis was something I feel like I needed to do to get a sense of where I\u2019m at. It would have been easy not to play and then just be unsure how I was going to feel in Paris.\u201d\nFederer, who said he did not know whether he would be fit enough to play in the third round against Dominic Thiem, is in danger of going into the French Open seriously short of matches. In his only other clay-court tournament this year he lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter-finals of last month\u2019s Monte Carlo Masters.\nIn the circumstances it was surprising that Federer enjoyed such a comfortable victory over Zverev, a 19-year-old German regarded as one of the best of an emerging group of younger players. \u00a0Federer quickly took command with an early break of serve and although the world No 44 retrieved an early break at the start of the second set he was broken again as the Swiss closed out victory after 87 minutes.\nFederer replaced Murray at No 2 in the rankings on Monday, but the Scot will be favourite to reclaim the position in time for the French Open, which begins in 11 days' time. \u00a0Murray would be certain to return to No 2 if he reached the final here, but there are plenty of other scenarios in which he would do so. If Federer lost in the final, for example, Murray would need only to win one more match this week to overtake him.\nBeing No 2 will earn more than prestige. It would also mean going to Roland Garros knowing that it would be impossible to face Novak Djokovic, the world No 1, before the final. Djokovic, who won the Madrid title on Sunday, began his defence of the title here with a 7-5, 7-5 victory over France\u2019s Stephane Robert.\nAlthough the sun did not shine as fiercely as it had earlier in the week, it was still warm and bright when Murray and Kukushkin entered the Grandstand stadium, which is the most recent addition to the ever-changing landscape here.\nThe magnificent sunken Pietrangeli court, with its marbled seating and surrounding neo-classical statues, was the main stadium when Mussolini had the Foro Italico constructed in 1932, but these days it stands at No 3 in the pecking order. The new main stadium on the site is a splendid example of modern Italian architecture, but functionality is the key to the Grandstand arena.\nMurray, who was playing his first match since announcing the split with his coach Amelie Mauresmo, had won all three of his previous meetings with Kukushkin. The 28-year-old from Kazakhstan is a stylish ball-striker but lacks the weapons to trouble the very best.\nThe only break of serve in the first set came in the eighth game. A superb lob which hit the baseline helped Murray go to break point and he followed up with a winning forehand pass.\nMurray, who had a first-round bye, broke again in the third game of the second set. The only time the Scot got into any difficulty on his serve was at 3-2. He went 15-40 down but dug himself out of trouble with some excellent serving.\nWhen Kukushkin served at 3-5 Murray stepped into his returns to put his opponent under intense pressure. A beautifully cushioned volley took the Scot to match point and he converted it when Kukushkin netted a backhand.\nMurray, who next plays France\u2019s Jeremy Chardy, was pleased with his performance given the change in conditions from Madrid, where he lost to Djokovic in the final on a cold and damp evening.\n\u201cI did some things well today, but I will need to play better,\u201d he said afterwards when asked if he thought he could win this tournament. \u201cIt was a good win against a guy who has probably been here a week, played three matches in these conditions and beaten some good players.\u201d\nNick Kyrgios extended his fine run of form by beating Milos Raonic. The Australian, who is at a career-high No 20 in the world rankings, won 7-6, 6-3 to earn a third-round meeting with Rafael Nadal or Philipp Kohlschreiber.\nMurray\u2019s brother, Jamie, who could reclaim the No 1 position in the world doubles ranking this week, won his first match alongside Bruno Soares. The Scot and the Brazilian beat Thiem and Zverev 6-1, 7-6.", "Heather Watson still has work to do if she is to achieve her main goal of 2016.

She has points to defend in Paris, having reached the second round there last year.\nWatson said that one of the reasons she will play next week is the chance to earn more ranking points, though it will also be an opportunity to get more clay-court matches under her belt. \u201cThe more matches the better,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that I always play better with more matches.\u201d\nAfter the glorious sunshine of previous days the skies were overcast following overnight rain.\u00a0 Watson had won her previous meeting with Strycova, in the first round of the French Open two years ago, but the world No 36 is a feisty competitor.\nStrycova, aged 30, achieved her highest world ranking position of No 20 last year. She is one of the most consistent performers on the women\u2019s tour, having finished the season in the world\u2019s top 100 for the last eight years in succession.\nEverything seemed straightforward for Watson when she dropped only three points in the first three games. The Briton raced into a 4-0 lead, but Strycova quickly fought back. The Czech soon levelled at 4-4 and then saved two game points in the following game before breaking Watson for the third time in a row. After 53 minutes she served out for the set.\nWatson, who saved only two of the eight break points she defended in the match, was soon 4-1 down in the second set. A break back to 4-2 briefly raised hopes of a revival, but Strycova quickly regained control to close out victory after an hour and 29 minutes, having won 12 of the last 14 games.\n\u201cI felt pretty flawless at the beginning, and then I remember being 40-15 up at 4-0 and she changed her game, started hitting a few loopy balls, which was smart,\u201d Watson said afterwards. \u201cI thought after that my level dropped a bit, but I also thought she improved a lot from there.\n\u201cI still had my chances to close to 4-4, but I thought that from then on she just played very well. Her balls were very deep and every time I'd set myself up in a point she'd just put the ball in a really awkward position for me.\u201d\nWatson added: \u201cThe good thing is I have had a lot of matches and I'm feeling very comfortable on the clay now. I would have loved to have gone further here, because I felt like I was playing great, but I'll take the positives and hopefully I can have another good week before the French.\u201d\nVictoria Azarenka, who has been the form player of the women\u2019s tour this year, lost her opening match, going down 6-3, 6-2 to Romania\u2019s Irina-Camelia Begu, the world No 35. Azarenka had established herself as one of the favourites for the French Open after winning titles in Brisbane, Indian Wells and Miami, but she has had a poor start to the clay-court season, which has often been her most challenging part of the year.\nHaving pulled out of last week\u2019s Madrid tournament before her third-round match because of a lower back injury, the world No 6 never got going here and again appeared to be struggling physically.\n\u201cI thought I was OK and was ready to play and come back, so I\u2019m just disappointed,\u201d Azarenka said afterwards.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that I can\u2019t play my best tennis.\u201d\nAsked if she felt she was ready for the French Open, the former world No 1 said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. I\u2019m not going to think about the future.\u201d\nGarbine Muguruza, last year\u2019s Wimbledon runner-up, wasted no time winning her opening match. The Spaniard dropped only four points on her serve in in beating Russia\u2019s Ekaterina Makarova 6-1, 6-0 in just 47 minutes.", "The court and the result could hardly have been more different to the scene 24 hours earlier as Johanna Konta\u2019s tournament ended here in disappointing fashion. One day after recording one of the best wins of her career when she brushed aside Robert Vinci in the main stadium at the Foro Italico, Konta was beaten 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 by Misaki Doi, a 25-year-old Japanese ranked 22 places lower than the Briton at No 45 in the world, on one of the outside courts.\nCourt One is as far away from the magnificent centre court arena as you can get. It sits almost in the shadow of the adjoining Olympic stadium, at the far end of the site. There is space for just a few hundred spectators, who sit on terracing around the sunken court. A low fence separates it from Court Two, which inevitably leads to some rallies being halted as stray balls interrupt play.\nAfter overnight rain the weather was cooler than on previous days, but it was still very bright, with the trees around the court providing dappled shade. There was also a gusting wind that occasionally whipped up clouds of clay from the adjoining court.\nKonta had won all three of her previous meetings with Doi. At just 5ft 3in tall and weighing less than 9 stone the left-handed Japanese does not pack a huge punch, though she is an impressive shot-maker and a fine athlete.\nFor three games, nevertheless, it seemed that Konta would carry on where she had left off against Vinci 24 hours earlier. Within 13 minutes the Briton was 3-0 up, but Doi quickly fought her way back into contention and retrieved one break before losing the first set 6-4.\nKonta broke again in the opening game of the second set, only for Doi to take the next four games in succession. Doi was unable to serve out for the set at 5-3 and failed to take three set points in the following game. However, when Konta served at 5-6 the Japanese finally converted her sixth set point to level the match.\nDoi continued to set the pace in the decider and made a crucial break of serve to go 4-2 up. Two games later she broke Konta for the seventh time to secure a hard-fought victory after two hours and 21 minutes.\n\u201cShe played very, very well today,\u201d Konta said afterwards. \u201cShe moved the ball around the way she wanted to and I didn't do a good enough job of getting her out of her comfort zone.\n\u201cI definitely fought my hardest. I don't think I could have done more today. I think I played with the cards I had, but I have a lot to take from it, to improve on and just try to get better. I'm most disappointed obviously that I'm not being able to give myself a chance to play tomorrow just to keep improving.\u201d\nHaving made a slow start to her clay-court campaign, Konta will head for the French Open, which starts in 10 days\u2019 time, with just five matches on clay under her belt. Did she feel that was enough going into Roland Garros? \u201cI'm going to take the most out of these five matches that I have played,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm grateful for every single one of them.\n\u201cObviously I always strive to give myself more opportunities, but I'm very happy with the level I was playing here this week in general. I think there are a lot of good things to take from it.\u201d\nSerena Williams, who is playing her first tournament of the clay-court season, was pushed hard in the opening set by her fellow American, Christina McHale, before winning 7-6, 6-1. She now faces a heavyweight quarter-final showdown with Svetlana Kuznetsova, who beat Daria Gavrilova 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.", "Roger Federer\u2019s participation in the forthcoming French Open is in the balance as the 34-year-old Swiss continues to recover from his latest injury in a season that has been dogged by physical issues.\nFederer was beaten 7-6, 6-4 by Dominic Thiem here in the third round of the Rome Masters and now faces a race against time to be fit for Roland Garros. He has appeared in a record 65 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments dating back to the 2000 Australian Open.\n\u201cI feel like now obviously time starts ticking more towards Paris,\u201d Federer said after his 78-minute defeat. \u201cThe next 10 or 12 days are really going to be important for me to recover and then make a plan.\u201d\nThe result means that Andy Murray will reclaim the world No 2 position from Federer next week and will be the No 2 seed at the French Open, which begins on Sunday week.\nIt has been a difficult year for Federer, who had knee surgery in February, pulled out of the Miami Masters in March because of illness and withdrew from last week\u2019s Madrid Masters because of his back problem. Since the end of January he has played in only two tournaments, having belatedly made his comeback at last month\u2019s Monte Carlo Masters, where he lost in the quarter-finals.\nFederer did not want to go into detail about his latest problem, saying only that it was \u201csomething to do with the back\u201d. He added: \u201cI just feel the body is not ready.\u201d\nHe said that he would not start the French Open if he felt as he had before his first match here, when he had expected to lose in straight sets to Alexander Zverev. However, the 17-times Grand Slam champion was happy that he had played two matches this week and said the defeat to Thiem was irrelevant in the bigger picture.\nAlthough he did not move with his usual fluency, Federer made the first break of serve in the opening set, only for Thiem to break back and force the tie-break, which he won 7-2. The Austrian made the crucial break in the second set at 2-2 when he chased down a Federer volley to hit a winning forehand cross-court pass.\n\u201cIt was important that I didn't have any setbacks and I was able to step on the tennis court and that I tried what I could with what I had,\u201d Federer said.\n\u201cI'm so happy that I didn't get hurt again this week, that it was worth it that I played on the court. OK it was compromised, but that I don't care about. I'm just happy I'm through the tournament now and I can look ahead. Now I can pace myself. In a match you cannot really pace yourself.\u201d\nFederer described this week\u2019s Rome Masters as \u201can information tournament for me, never a result tournament\u201d. He explained: \u201cI knew I wasn't good enough for any result here, so that's why I hope you don't read into it so much and I don't.\n\u201cFor me, I need to see this completely in isolation. I cannot carry any luggage from here other than the positive information out of Rome. It just needs to stay here, the results, what I couldn't do and how limited I was. I was far off. I need to see it completely in isolation.\n\u201cIf I see it that way, actually things are pretty good. If you look at the results and how I played things are not great, but those things can change very quickly, as we know. If I can play 100 per cent again and move again correctly, my mind's in a good place and my game is there.\u201d\nAsked if he thought he might be running out of time to make the French Open, Federer said: \u201cI'm confident and hopeful at the same time. I have only played five matches in the last, what is it, four months now, so clearly I don't want to get too overly excited about what's ahead.\n\u201cBut at the same time I'm a positive thinker and I believe that I'm going to recover well from Madrid and here now, that hopefully the next 10 days are going to be easier and I can practise really well starting next week.\u201d\nFederer never considered missing the whole of the clay-court season in order to focus on grass. He said that his enforced withdrawal from the Miami tournament had actually given him the chance to work more on clay this year. He practised at the Monte Carlo Masters for 10 days before the start of the tournament.\n\u201cI guess I never had better clay-court preparation,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cI have a lot of hours on the clay already this year - maybe not on match courts, but on practice courts. I actually thought I could really do a good result in Paris.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more difficult in the last couple of weeks. I see my chances as not great to have the most unbelievable run [at the French Open]. But if maybe in three or four days I can practise 100 per cent for next week, then I believe that something is possible again. But as of now, clearly the way I'm playing right now is never going to be enough for any good run in Paris.\u201d", "Rarely can the first game of a match have been as misleading. David Goffin came out with all guns blazing in his Rome Masters quarter-final here against Andy Murray and broke the Scot to love in the opening game after a stunning sequence of bold returns and attacking ground strokes.\nJust an hour and a half later, however, the 25-year-old Belgian was heading back to the locker room after losing the match 6-1, 7-5. Although Goffin made a fight of it during a topsy-turvy second set which featured seven breaks of serve, Murray was a deserving winner. The Scot made just 13 unforced errors in the match and in testing conditions looked sharp throughout.\nMurray, who will return to No 2 in the world rankings on Monday, has now reached the semi-finals of all three of this year\u2019s Masters Series clay-court tournaments. Tomorrow he should fancy his chances of reaching a second successive final and his first here at the Foro Italico.\u00a0 In the semi-finals he will play the world No 52, France\u2019s Lucas Pouille, who went through after Juan Monaco pulled out with an injury. With the start of the French Open only nine days away, Murray could hardly be happier with his form.\n\u201cI think I'm getting rewarded now for the work that I put in over the years on this surface,\u201d Murray said afterwards. \u201cObviously it took me time to feel comfortable on it. But I didn't just give up on clay and say: \u2018You know what? This isn't my surface. I'm not going to prepare for it properly or train hard.\u2019\n\u201cI have had good results at Roland Garros in the past but in the Masters Series obviously I\u2019ve not played as well. But I have also had chances to do very well in these tournaments before.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI didn't necessarily expect to be doing as well as I have been the last couple of years, but I deserve it because I have worked hard for it.\u201d\nAlthough Murray had won all three of his previous matches against Goffin, the most recent of which had secured Britain\u2019s Davis Cup final victory at the end of last year, the Belgian is enjoying an excellent season.\u00a0 The world No 13 reached the semi-finals of the Masters Series tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami and would have been in the top 10 if he had matched that performance here.\nMurray had played his third-round match in the adjoining Pietrangeli stadium, a sunken court with marble terracing for spectators overlooked by neo-classical statues of soldiers and sportsmen. The quarter-final was played in the very different environment of the main stadium, which is a shining example of modern Italian architecture. With its steep sides and comparatively small court area, it can generate a superb atmosphere.\nOnce again there had been overnight rain, but the weather had brightened up by mid-afternoon. However, the wind that swirled around the stadium made the conditions difficult for both men. On a number of occasions the players had to wait for the wind to die down after clay dust blew in their faces.\nFor Murray it was a case of waiting for Hurricane David to subside. Goffin started as he had left off the previous evening, when he recorded the first 6-0, 6-0 victory of his professional career to beat Tomas Berdych in just 48 minutes in the third round.\nMurray did not have to wait long, though it had more to do with his own brilliance than any failings on Goffin\u2019s part. From 30-30 in the second game Murray hit a thunderous backhand cross-court winner and then an equally potent backhand return to complete the break back.\nThe Scot had hit one poor drop shot in the opening game but quickly rediscovered the touch he had shown against Jeremy Chardy the previous evening. Goffin is quicker than the Frenchman but repeatedly struggled to pick up Murray\u2019s well disguised and beautifully executed drop shots. Murray took the opening set in just 27 minutes, by which time he had made only two unforced errors.\nNevertheless, it was Goffin who made the first break of the second set to go 3-1 up. With both players going for their shots and hitting big returns, there was only one hold of serve in a remarkable sequence of eight games.\nAt 5-5 Murray made the last and definitive breakthrough as Goffin, looking increasingly tired under Murray\u2019s relentless pressure, missed three backhands in a row. In the following game Murray converted his first match point when Goffin hit a backhand return long.\n\u201cThe conditions were very, very difficult, very windy,\u201d Murray said.\u00a0 \u201cIt was changing direction all the time. There was obviously a lot of the clay getting blown off the court as well. It's not always that easy to move when it's like that because it's changing every point. Sometimes, because you put clay on it, the end changes, so it's a little bit more normal and then two points later there's no clay on the court at all and it's like a hard court.\u201d\nMurray said it would mean a lot to him to reach the final of such an historic tournament as this. \u201cI haven't been in this position in these tournaments very often,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in Monte-Carlo I think I had only been to the semis once before this year. They are great tournaments with a lot of history.\u201d\nPouille, Murray\u2019s next opponent, had never reached a Masters Series quarter-final before this week. The 22-year-old Frenchman is regarded as a player with great potential, though fortune has been on his side here. He lost in the final round of qualifying but got into the main draw as a \u201clucky loser\u201d after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga pulled out through injury.\nMurray said: \u201cThis week he's been a bit fortunate as the lucky loser and maybe the withdrawal today, but he's very good. By the end of this year he'll be up close to the top 20 in the world, potentially higher.\u201d\nJamie Murray and Bruno Soares were beaten 6-3, 6-4 by Bob and Mike Bryan in the quarter-finals of the doubles. Victory for Murray would have seen the Scot return to the world No 1 position but instead he will go up one place to No 3 next week. Nevertheless he is only 55 points off the No 1 position and has only 180 points to defend at the French Open.", "Serena Williams will head for the French Open next week with only one clay-court tournament under her belt, but on current evidence that could be enough for the world No 1 as she attempts to retain her title at Roland Garros. While her closest rivals struggle for any consistency, Williams has reached the final here in her first tournament appearance for two months.\nWilliams, who will meet Madison Keys on Sunday in an all-American final, last competed in Miami, where she was beaten by Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round. She pulled out of last week\u2019s tournament in Madrid with flu but has looked in good shape here, with Romania\u2019s Irina-Camelia Begu her latest victim.\u00a0\nThe world No 1 won their semi-final 6-4, 6-1, while Keys beat Spain\u2019s Garbine Muguruza, last year\u2019s Wimbledon runner-up, 7-6, 6-4. Both matches were interrupted by rain on a largely damp and drab day in the Italian capital.\nHaving won three titles at the Foro Italico (in 2002, 2013 and 2014) and reached the semi-final or better on eight occasions, Williams has a fine record here. She has won 42 matches at the tournament, which was more than double the total of wins enjoyed here by the three other semi-finalists.\nNevertheless, Williams\u2019 form has been a concern ever since last year\u2019s US Open, where she was beaten by Roberta Vinci when only two wins away from completing a pure Grand Slam. This is the first time since 1998 that she has contested this tournament without already having a won a title in the season to date.\nBegu, who was playing here for only the second time, has been enjoying a good clay-court season and started confidently enough. However, the world No 35 was made to regret not taking her chances when Williams held serve at 1-1 from 0-40 down.\nThere were brief interruptions for rain, but once Williams had got in front she rarely looked like being caught. The American completed her victory after an hour and 26 minutes with a winning volley.\nKeys, who had failed to progress beyond the second round on both her previous appearances here, is through to her first final for more than a year. The 21-year-old American has a game better suited to quicker surfaces and lost to lower-ranked opponents in both her previous clay-court tournaments this year, but has played well this week.\nThe first set, which featured just one break of serve apiece, ended in a tie-break which Keys won 7-5. The world No 24 made the only break of the second set at 3-3 and was within two points of victory at 5-4 and 30-15 when rain started to fall again.\nThe match was halted for six minutes, but when they resumed Keys won two of the next three points with service winners to complete victory after an hour and 42 minutes. Eight double faults had not helped Muguruza\u2019s cause.", "The hearing into Maria Sharapova\u2019s positive drugs test is expected to be heard next week.\nReports from reliable American sources, including \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d, said that the International Tennis Federation would hold the hearing in London.\nIt is expected to take place on Wednesday and Thursday next week, though the findings are unlikely to be released before next month.\nSharapova revealed two months ago that she had failed a test for Meldonium, a drug which was put on the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s banned list at the start of this year.\nThe Russian, who failed the test at the Australian Open in January, said that she had been unaware of the change.\nAlthough Sharapova could be banned for up to four years, the likelihood is that she will be given a significantly shorter suspension.\nThe former world No 1 said when revealing the failed test that she had been prescribed the drug by her doctor 10 years ago because of health issues, including a family history of diabetes.", "Come rain or shine, there is no stopping Andy Murray. On a frustrating day when rain showers and sunny periods took it in turns to prevail, Murray reached the final of the Rome Masters here for the first time when he beat France\u2019s Lucas Pouille 6-2, 6-1.\nWith the French Open just\u00a0a week away the world No 3 demonstrated again that he can be a major contender at Roland Garros. Since winning his first title on clay just 13 months ago Murray has repeatedly proved that he need no longer have any inferiority complex on a surface which used to be so challenging for him.\nThe Scot\u2019s clay-court performances in the last month have been outstanding. In three Masters Series tournaments on the surface he has reached the semi-finals in Monte Carlo, where he lost to Rafael Nadal, and the final in Madrid, where he was beaten by Novak Djokovic. In Sunday's final he will face either Djokovic or Kei Nishikori, who met\u00a0in the second semi-final.\nMurray, who will return to No 2 in the world rankings on Monday, never looked in danger against Pouille, who was meeting the Scot for the first time. Striking the ball sweetly and dominating the vast majority of the rallies, Murray did not face any break points and needed only 59 minutes to complete a decisive victory. The match was over so quickly that afterwards Murray went back out on to the practice court for 20 minutes.\nPouille had never reached the quarter-finals of a Masters Series event before this week. The 22-year-old Frenchman lost in the final round of qualifying here\u00a0but was handed a place in the main draw \u2013 and a first-round bye \u2013 when he replaced the injured Jo-Wilfried Tsonga as a \u201clucky loser\u201d.\nWith Juan Monaco also withdrawing from his scheduled quarter-final against Pouille because of injury, the Frenchman needed to win only two matches \u2013 against Ernests Gulbis and David Ferrer \u2013 to reach the last four. He was only the second lucky loser\u00a0ever to reach the last four of a Masters Series tournament following Thomas Johansson, who lost to Roger Federer in the Toronto semi-finals in 2004.\nPouille, nevertheless, is regarded as a player of great promise. Already at a career-high No 52 in the world rankings, he is expected to climb another 20 places next week. Beating Ferrer on clay for the loss of just five games in the third round here was no mean achievement, while David Goffin was among his three victims in Madrid last week.\nGarbine Muguruza and Madison Keys had been due to open proceedings in the main stadium, but with the start of play delayed by three and a half hours by almost constant rain their semi-final was moved to another court. Instead it was Murray and Pouille who took the stage just before 3.30pm in a stadium that was barely half full.\n\u201cThat was maybe the first time in my career \u2013 and I've played over 700 matches - where I have actually gone on the court without actually getting to hit a ball before the match started,\u201d Murray said later. \u201cWe were having lunch, walked back over [to the stadium] and were told the schedule was going to be moved and that we would be the first match on. I had 45 minutes to get ready, though I\u2019m obviously glad we got on and got the match done.\u201d\nMurray wasted no time stamping his authority on the match, breaking serve in the fourth game with a forehand pass down the line. The Scot was serving at 4-2 and 40-0 when rain forced the players off court for 13 minutes, but the break did nothing to halt his momentum.\nPouille saved two set points when he served at 2-5 but gifted Murray a third when putting a smash directly into the Scot's\u00a0hitting zone and was beaten by a forehand cross-court pass. A missed forehand on the next point gave Murray the set.\nAt 1-1 in the second set rain started to fall again, but the players stayed on court. Some of the crowd huddled under umbrellas, but Murray clearly had no desire to go off for another break. He did not lose another game and completed the most emphatic of victories with an ace.\n\u201cAndy is a great player,\u201d Pouille said afterwards. \u201cHe returns all your serves, so if you don't have a great first serve percentage then it's very tough. He's very offensive and puts pressure on your serves.\u201d\nMurray will celebrate his 29th birthday on Sunday. \u201cI haven't won many matches on my birthday before, to be honest,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHopefully tomorrow that will change.\u201d"], "life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news": ["The launch of Apple Music has actually helped out Spotify, it has claimed.\nMany had worried that Apple\u2019s relative clout \u2013 as well as the fact that it can do things like pre-install its music app on all iPhones \u2013 would mean that Spotify could face trouble from Apple\u2019s competitor. But since Apple Music was launched in June last year the company\u2019s growth has actually sped up.\nSpotify has said that the launch of Apple Music has simply served to raise the profile of streaming music services and helped the other companies that are in the market.\n\"It's great that Apple is in the game. They are definitely raising the profile of streaming. It is hard to build an industry on your own,\" Jonathan Forster, a vice president and one of its first employees, told Reuters.\n\"Since Apple Music started we've been growing quicker and adding more users than before.\n\"It would be terrible if we were just taking each other's users or to learn there was just a ceiling of 100 million users - I don't think that is the case.\u201d\nBut Mr Forster said that it couldn\u2019t be the case that there was a large number of streaming companies in the coming years. As well as Spotify and Apple Music, other smaller companies like Tidal and SoundCloud have launched their own streaming services.\n\"My Internet history would tell me that there's probably not going to be that many significant players, and then maybe smaller niche cases ... maybe there could be a classical music streaming service,\" he told Reuters. \"It's a hard business.\"\nSpotify has 30 million users, making it far bigger than any of its competitors. But Apple Music has been growing quickly, and it recently announced that it has 13 million users \u2013 all of which are paying subscribers, since it doesn\u2019t offer a free option as Spotify does.\nMr Forster also said that Spotify is looking to branch out into other businesses like merchandising, and video \u2013 an area that Apple Music has already pushed into, with exclusive rights to a Taylor Swift concert film and rumours that it is working on other original content.\nSpotify has had a complicated relationship with Apple Music since it came out. Shortly after the service was launched, he tweeted \u201cOh ok.\u201d \u2013 a message that was later deleted and went unexplained.\nApple came relatively late to music streaming, after trying other approaches like cloud-based music libraries and a focus on buying music through iTunes. But it came to the market with a \u2013 as well as an existing framework through its own iTunes and the purchase of Beats, it pushed Apple Music through heavy advertising spends and pre-installing the app on all iOS and Mac OS devices.\nSince it was launched, Apple Music has faced some criticism because of what some people have said is a confusing and difficult interface. It is said to be re-designing that app ready for its big developer conference in June, where it will get a simplified design and have some of its less-used features scaled back.", "Amazon is launching a new video service that will let people upload their own films \u2013 and then make money from them.\nIn what appears to be an attempt to take on YouTube and its \u201cPartners\u201d service, which lets people share the advertising proceeds from their videos, the company is launching Amazon Video Direct. Users of the service will have their videos features in the main Amazon Video app.\nCreators of videos will receive a share of the money made from Amazon Prime subscribers, who must pay to be a member of the video service.

I mention this because ebook readers are \nBut real books, though less portable in huge numbers, have a lot to offer, too. And do you really need 1,000 books with you on holiday? I mean, how long are you going for?\nOf course, that\u2019s not really the point \u2013 you don\u2019t need 1,000 albums in your iPod but it\u2019s great to have the choice. Not to mention that ebooks download wirelessly in under a minute, so if you finish the first volume of \nSo here I am, testing how the Oasis compares to other ebook readers and to real books. After all, Amazon says it\u2019s aiming to make its readers as good as books.\u00a0\nIn many ways there\u2019s still no comparison to the feel of rich paper under your fingers, the ultimate sharpness of ink compared to electronics, or the way the weight of each half of the book telling you how far you are through it, even if your eyes are shut. Navigation is still better in a paper book \u2013 flick to a note at the back and you can easily find your way back to the page you were on. You can have several pages open at the same time as you amble off to browse the photos in the middle of the book before flipping back to where you were. \nAnd a pile of books on your table tells a visitor much more about who you are than electronics ever can (\u201cOoh, look, he\u2019s got an iPad Mini\u201d).\nBut convenience is still keen with an ebook reader. The weight of my one real holiday book, the brilliant \nAfter a day at the beach, a paper book can look a bit dog-eared. The Oasis comes with a clever leather book cover which connects magnetically and includes a big battery to extend reading life considerably. And the leather on that has got pretty scuffed in a matter of days. This weathered, lived-in look will appeal to some. But it\u2019s a surprise, a change compared to the pristine look every previous Kindle has maintained throughout its life.\nThe Oasis, especially when the leather cover is removed, is astonishingly light. It\u2019s also very thin, apart from the edge where the page-turn buttons sit. This thicker edge makes it easier to hold and you can turn it upside down if you prefer the buttons on the other side \u2013 the onscreen words turn with it. Even so, there\u2019s a knack to holding it: if the buttons are leaning too hard on your fingers, they can turn when you don\u2019t mean them to, and if you rest your thumb off the buttons, you must take care not to engage the touchscreen. There\u2019s no lip between frame and screen as there is on cheaper Kindles. This looks much classier, but it makes inadvertent page turns too easy. These are not big problems and you can easily acclimatise.\nPurchasing content is still not quite as fluent as I\u2019d like. I enjoy the possibility of seeing a sample first but why can\u2019t I save notes? One of the best features of a Kindle is the way you can highlight text without making the book dog-eared as you would with highlighter pen and paper. I can\u2019t do this in a sample. I imagine it\u2019s to encourage me to buy the book but actually it puts me off. And what\u2019s the problem with me highlighting in a sample? After all, the notes could be set to vanish if I don\u2019t buy the book.\nSay I do buy it, and it\u2019s duly and instantly downloaded \u2013 why do I have to start again with the full version, instead of the sample becoming the full version, saving my place and my notes?\nThese are minor niggles. The screen is sharp and pristine, page turns are fast and smooth, and the flush screen makes the reader feel slick and modern. Amazon\u2019s new system fonts and screen layout work well. The buttons to turn the pages are a little clicky, so if you\u2019re reading in bed, as you can with the adjustable light on the Oasis, you may prefer to use the touchscreen for page turns, rather than risk waking your significant other.\nThe lightness and size of the Oasis are really brilliant, breaking new ground for comfort and efficiency that other makers will have to try to match.\nThe battery in the reader edges down during the day, but attach it to the cover and it bumps right back up again, and quickly.\u00a0\nAll that said, the next model down in the line-up, the ", "Google has banned all payday lenders from advertising on its service, because it argues that they harm its users.\nFrom July, loan providers that make customers pay exceptionally high interest or have repayment schedules that are unusually fast will be banned from Google\u2019s ad systems.\nThe company said that it had made the change \u201cto protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products\u201d.

It has replaced the realistic polaroid camera that made up Instagram\u2019s old logo, and which had gone mostly unchanged since the app was launched in 2010.\u00a0\nAs well as its new logo, the app showed off a completely re-design of the app. While it keeps its traditional arrangement of a long feed of pictures with writing underneath, it has stripped away the traditional blue and replaced it with an almost completely black-and-white design.\nThe new look caused a combination of joy and terror on social media. Because of auto-updates, many people found that their phones had updated before they woke up \u2013 when they found the new, gradient-based app icon on their home screen.\nInstagram\u2019s old logo was always relatively non-flat when compared with most of the other popular social apps. Facebook and Twitter, for instance, are both white logos depicted on blue backgrounds.\nThat re-design had been long rumoured and comes as just one of a range of rumoured flatter, black and white re-designs that also includes the updated Apple Music scheduled for release this summer. That could partly be an effort to get ready for the \u201cdark mode\u201d that is expected to come to iOS and allow the phones colours to be turned black at night time.\nAs well as helping the app fit in with the look of other products, the new design helps people see more of their pictures, according to the company. \u201cThe simpler design puts more focus on your photos and videos without changing how you navigate the app,\u201d Instagram said in a blog post.\nIt said that it had made the design in response to the way that people were using the site.

It is meant as an easy way of sharing photos, using recognition technology to pick out photos that include the same people and grouping them together.\nBut since people were automatically opted into that feature, and so had their faces and identities analysed by people who were using the app, privacy watchdogs in the EU and Canada stopped it coming from the UK.\nNow Facebook has created a new version of the app that just links together photos of people who look similar. It still requires the person using Moments to say who each person is, and those labels will be kept private to each user.\nThat technique is known as \u201cfacial clustering\u201d.

Both are intended as a way of grouping up photos and then sharing them with the people involved \u2013 a process that is largely helped by recognising the people in photos.\nAnd like Google Photos, it is intended to let people share in private \u2013 taking on messaging apps like WhatsApp more than it is public Facebook posts.", "WhatsApp has finally fixed perhaps its most glaring problem and released an official app for desktop.\nThe company has at last brought its messaging platform to the PC.

That means that it will still require the handset to be turned on and have an internet connection.\nWhatsApp is thought to keep that requirement because it helps with the app\u2019s security. It means that all messages are sent to one specific device, making it easier to know if somebody\u2019s account has been hacked, and also makes it easy to stop people using an account if it has been hacked.\nBut WhatsApp has also always focused on a mobile-first strategy. It requires that people sign up using their phone number, for instance, and doesn\u2019t allow people to run the app\u00a0on tablets or other platforms.\nThe desktop app is available for Windows 8 and later, and Mac OS 10.9 and later.

But a bold new proposal hopes to make the little characters more diverse.\nGoogle employees have proposed a new set of 13 emoji that would show women doing a range of different professional roles, removing the apparently rigid gender stereotypes that have existed until now. The new images would show men and women doing jobs like farming or working in health care.\nIf the proposals are adopted by the Unicode Consortium \u2013 which rules over which emoji are let onto the keyboard, though each of them must be integrated and designed by each platform maker \u2013 then the team of four Googlers hope that the keyboard can be more inspiring to young women.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it time that emoji also reflect the reality that women play a key role in every walk of life and in every profession?\u201d a proposal sent by the four Google employees says. Young women are the heaviest users of emoji, but there are few representations of them at all.\nThe Unicode Consortium has responded to criticisms about diversity in the past. Most notably it added five different skin tones to each emoji that depicted a person\u2019s face, meaning that people can hopefully see their own skin tone reflected alongside the default yellow.\nBut that same issue showed how winning around the non-profit Unicode Consortium isn\u2019t the only problem with diversifying emoji. Some companies have been slow to adopt the skin tone modifiers \u2013 though most now have the new emoji as part of their platforms.\nOther companies have previously claimed to have created feminist emoji, including a firm last year that made pictures of women including Beyonce and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The feature allows cameras to take much deeper, more detailed photos by taking two photos next to each other, rather than one.\nBut new detail from reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo restates that prediction and says that the new camera will be limited to the bigger phone but there won\u2019t be a single-camera version. The phone will also have its RAM upgrade to 3GB to help the phone deal with extra work required to do to process such photos.\nThe news is good for the many customers that now use their iPhone as their primary camera. Some integrations of such a set-up can allow the phones to take SLR-level pictures, with much more depth and clarity than those taken with a single camera.\nBut it also means that the camera bulge that sticks out of the back of the iPhone 6 is set to continue onto the new phone, if leaked photos of the case are to be believed. And because the phone has to put the two lenses next to each other, that bulge might be even larger \u2013 wide enough to incorporate two cameras on the back of the phone rather than just one.\nThat camera bulge has proved controversial with many users, who say that it is ugly. It also means that the phone can\u2019t sit straight on a flat surface, since the extra part of the phone leads it to wobble.\nApple doesn\u2019t seem concerned about those complaints, releasing the iPad Pro in March with its own little camera bulge sticking out of the back. That doesn\u2019t cause the device to wobble but still sticks out \u2013 a fact that Apple didn\u2019t shy away from showing in its introductory videos.\nA range of other rumours have emerged about the iPhone 7, including reports that have suggested it will include the Smart Connector from the iPad Pro and that it will remove the headphone jack.", "The old iPod gathering dust in your attic could be worth tens of thousands of dollars.\nSome models sold for just a couple of hundred pounds could be worth a fortune.\nThe value of iPods rocketed in the wake of Apple\u2019s confirmation, in 2014, that it was dropping the iPod Classic from its range. That device \u2013 which was originally known as just the iPod and is perhaps Apple\u2019s most iconic product in history \u2013 prompted a run on iPods by people who wanted the huge amount of storage space and battery life that they offered.\nNow, that desire has led to prices in the tens of thousands of dollars for iPods.\nEven plain, relatively new iPods still send for upwards of \u00a3500 on eBay, today. But the real money is made in the much older models \u2013 those that are still in their boxes and are relatively rare.\u00a0\nIn 2014, Terapeak \u2013 which tracks eBay sales \u2013 said that it had seen sales of one factory-sealed U2 iPod for $90,000.

Currently a set of the three different storage options that the first generation of iPods came in is for sale for $50,000 online.\nThe same effect has been seen for early Apple computers and other devices.

Facebook denied the reports and said there was no evidence that such behaviour was happening \u2013 but some people\u2019s most terrifying worry had already come true, whether or not it was actually false.\nBut perhaps the bigger misconception was ever believing that there was an unmediated version of Facebook that doesn\u2019t have any biases. Some people appeared to believe that humans intervening would inevitably bring bias, and that those decisions should instead be made by uninterested humans \u2013 but algorithms can be just as biased, largely because they are made by people.\nFacebook\u2019s algorithms are a huge and somewhat mysterious machine that rule our entire lives. The news this week should be a reminder that they are shaping the way we see the world in never before seen ways.\nBut it still isn\u2019t really clear how to actually get seen on the service \u2013 if it were too clear, Facebook would probably change the algorithm so it wasn\u2019t. The site\u2019s algorithm does seem, or has seemed in the past, to give priority to personal events over news of any kind. In 2014, for instance, BuzzFeed reported that one user had decided to pretend that they had got married \u2013 and then used that that to push up posts about the Ferguson protests. Since marriages are prioritised by Facebook\u2019s algorithm, that post was reported to have gone to the top of the feed and then stayed there.\n\u201cI noticed that while my posts usually get a billion likes and comments on education stuff, for some reason, my feed is relatively silent about Ferguson Missouri,\u201d the post read. \u201cI have a suspicion that Facebook is hiding these posts from feeds, pretty much in line with how Facebook operates.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no reason to think that those posts were actually being actively or knowingly hidden by Facebook or people working for it. Instead, they are a consequence of the inevitable bias of an algorithm. Promoting personal life events might seem a good thing, in itself, since they are most likely to be of interest to a person\u2019s friends; but accidentally doing that too much might lead to the news feed leaving out important events in the world.\nFacebook\u2019s algorithms nowadays also promote the kinds of posts that it wants to see on its network. So at the moment many organisations are running Facebook Lives \u2013 streaming broadcasts of videos that represent an area that Facebook wants to break into, and not by coincidence tend to appear at the top of people\u2019s news feeds.\nAny quirk with Facebook\u2019s algorithms \u2013 even the tiniest one \u2013 will become huge. The site is now the biggest distributor of media in history, and what people see there has a unique effect on the way the world works.\nThe really important decisions that Facebook makes are the smallest tweaks. It regularly alters its algorithms to privilege certain things \u2013 looking out for links that people tend not to spend any time on once they\u2019ve clicked, for instance. That change \u2013 which was intended to privilege quality \u2013 at the same time cut off an entire industry of sites that lured people in with headlines that didn\u2019t actually match what they saw.\nIn one sense, Facebook\u2019s problems with breaking and important news are an inevitable part of having an algorithm based on engagement. (Twitter, for its troubles, is usually held up as the example of a good social network for breaking news \u2013 it has an algorithmic timeline but it can be turned off.) Algorithms like those used by Facebook watch in part for posts that are getting particular traction among their users. That is measured in part by things like how many people are liking, sharing and reading an article.\nBut that process will always be slow. It requires a certain amount of people to start giving an article a push \u2013 at which point it might start being spread around, but only after some time. But Facebook is aware of this \u2013 it is continually testing new things, in secret or in the open, for getting itself to become more of a platform for breaking news and everything else in the world. Trending Topics, which set off this week\u2019s controversy, was an attempt to do that: gathering news stories before they took off and highlighting posts about them.\nUltimately, Facebook\u2019s likely aims are simple: ensure that people keep using and engaging with the site. It makes money from gathering data about people and then showing them ads based on that data. None of that means that the huge amounts of scepticism that regularly meet its changes and announcements aren't justified. It just means they might be much smaller, and less secret, than we'd realised.", "It might be the most controversial tiny square of the year. \nThe company has launched a re-design of its app alongside a new, sunset-themed logo. Many found the new design when they opened up their phone and saw the new image sitting there, delivered to them through automatic software updates.\nStraight away, users erupted in anger. One of the ways that it was announced was in a post by Kevin System, the CEO and founder of Instagram, who shared a video showing the old logo changing into the new one \u2013 that post was greeted by more than a thousand comments, almost all of which were outraged.\n\u201cThe new logo looks really bad, and I hate the white in app,\u201d wrote one user. The post was flooded with comments using the hashtags #changeitback and #old insta, which also became popular across the entire site.\nBut there are parts of a post by Ian Spalter, Instagram\u2019s head of design, that hints at why exactly people are so mad about the change. Writing about the decisions that went into changing the app icon away from the a \u201crendered camera\u201d and into an image that could be more flexible and blown up at size, Mr Spalter said that the company \u201chad to figure out how to give the new mark more character while also removing what was unnecessary\u201d.\nHe continued: \u201cThe question then became, how far do we go? If you abstract too much, the glyph doesn\u2019t feel tied to the history and soul of Instagram. If you make it too literal, it\u2019s hard to justify changing from what we currently have.\n\u201cAfter a lot of refinement, we landed on a glyph that still suggests a camera, but also sets the groundwork for years to come.\u201d\nIt seems to be that tension \u2013 and the loss of connection to the \u201chistory and soul of Instagram\u201d \u2013 that has made people so angry. Many people love the old Instagram logo, so much that people bake cakes shaped like it and use it for important parts of their own design, and the new logo doesn\u2019t appear to keep enough of a connection to that previous one.\nCritics around the web agreed.\n\u201cIn short, it looks and feels like an altogether new brand for Instagram, not an update or refresh of their old brand \u2014 and I\u2019m not convinced that was the right move,\u201d wrote John Gruber, a technology journalist who regularly writes on design choices. Gruber noted that the company had stuck with the realistic picture of a camera long after most people had embraced \"flat\" design, which meant that any change was probably going to cause big problems.\nMr Gruber pointed to other pieces including an Adweek posted titled \u201cInstagram\u2019s new logo is a travesty. Can we change it back? Please?\u201d and a tweet by design critic Eli Schiff who said it was an \u201cabomination\u201d.\nMany pointed out that the initial shock of a new logo doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\u201cRemember that with logos there is: 1) how you first feel about it, 2) How it settles in, and 3) How it ages,\u201d wrote Twitter\u2019s vice president for design in a post on the service. \u201cAnd the first is the least important if you are talking about a redesign,\u201d he wrote, while pointing out that doing well on all three points would be the aim.\nAnd the company was apparently entirely ready for the kind of vitriol that have met the new logo. Fast Company interviewed Instagram\u2019s head of design, Ian Spalter, who said that he had been preparing for that anger.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a vacation,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cIn a bunker.\u201d", "Much of the information stored and shared on the site could be used maliciously, and so it is important to ensure that you\u2019re careful about all of the data that\u2019s on there.\nAs such, it\u2019s worth at least being aware of all of the data that you have given over.

So it\u2019s best to keep it quiet.\nThe site forces you to hand this information over, so that it can make sure that you\u2019re old enough to use it. And putting in the wrong date is possible but it will mean that people will wish you a happy birthday on whichever date you choose \u2013 after which you\u2019ll be forced to explain.\nInstead it\u2019s best just to hide the information, making sure that nobody can see the information on your birthday or on your profile.\u00a0\nYou probably wouldn\u2019t give out your home address to a stranger. But you might be doing that accidentally while you use the site.\nPeople often list their address while planning events, or even on their own page.

But it can also be a terrifying way of those people catching up with you.\nKeeping full details of all of your employment on your profile makes it easier for people to find you since you\u2019ll more easily show up in search results and in groups. If you want to keep the information on there but would rather not show up there, you could change the name slightly, so that it will be obvious to anyone who visits but people will less easily be able to find you.\nThis isn\u2019t so much a security or privacy concern \u2013 though it might be \u2013 as it is about conserving your pride. Because Facebook is now so old, it has changed a lot \u2013 and, probably, so have you.\nThat could mean that there\u2019s embarrassing information ", "The DVLA could be about to get rid of plastic driving licences.\nOliver Morley, the CEO of the British driving authority, has teased on Twitter a \u201cprototype\u201d of a feature that would let people store their licence in their phone.\nThe feature is not yet released and was teased as \u201csomething we\u2019re working on\u201d. But if released it could represent a major change in the way that driving licences are used and issued.\nThe picture shows a driving licence inside Apple\u2019s Wallet app. That\u2019s where cards are stored for the Apple Pay payment system, as well as other passes like tickets and loyalty cards.\nThe company has always presented the app as a way of getting rid of people\u2019s traditional wallets, and it has become more useful with the rollout of Apple Pay, meaning that iPhones can be used instead of a payment card. But if the feature shown off in Mr Morley\u2019s tweet is true then the agency could get rid of the last reason that some people keep their wallet around.\nListed on the licence in the image are the driver\u2019s birth date, the date of issue for the licence and its expiry. It also includes the driver\u2019s name and picture.\nThe teaser comes just a year after \nIt isn\u2019t clear how a digital version of the driving licence would replace the real one. For one, such an image is easy to fake \u2013 since all that would be needed is an image on the screen, it would presumably be very possible to create a false version that included a fake name or birth date.\nBut the pass could just as easily be connected to a database or other feature that would verify any press that was presented. Already many venues connect to a database of IDs that allow them to check whether a person should be let in \u2013 and the driving licence tool could presumably run on a similar service.\nThat would allow it to simply be checked in the same quick way that tickets are \u2013 representing more of a link to the information on a verified service, rather than a way of showing that information itself.", "Samsung's upcoming \nThe rumour was started by Evan Blass, prolific mobile industry leaker, who tweeted: \"Samsung Galaxy Note 6 US release scheduled for week of August 15.\"\nBlass's tweet only referred to the US, but the Note 6 could see its worldwide debut on the same date.

They were intended partly as a way of answering calls for a \u201cDislike\u201d button \u2013 allowing people to share their feelings about posts without appearing to endorse what had been said.\nBut the Belgian police now says that the site is using them as a way of collecting information about people and deciding how best to advertise to them. As such, it has warned people that they should avoid using the buttons if they want to preserve their privacy.\n\u201cThe icons help not only express your feelings, they also help Facebook assess the effectiveness of the ads on your profile,\u201d a post on Belgian\u2019s official police website reads.\nThe site is able to use the tool to tell when people are likely to be in a good mood and then use that to decide when is the best time to show them ads, the Belgian police has claimed.\n\u201cBy limiting the number of icons to six, Facebook is counting on you to express your thoughts more easily so that the algorithms that run in the background are more effective,\u201d the post continues. \u201cBy mouse clicks you can let them know what makes you happy.\n\u201cSo that will help Facebook find the perfect location, on your profile, allowing it to display content that will arouse your curiosity but also to choose the time you present it.

Though the site said as it was launched that it was a way of allowing people to react in more complex ways, it also provides valuable data to Facebook about how things make people feel, as well as encouraging them to interact with posts amid worries that people are becoming less and less personal on the site.\nSoon after the feature was released, ", "Google has revealed the most powerful computer for understanding the English language in the world \u2013 and called it Parsey McParseFace.\nThe technology, which is built on the more sensibly named TensorFlow and SyntaxNet frameworks, is a powerful tool that uses new artificial intelligence technology to be able to analyse the linguistic structure of language, and understand what each part of a sentence does to its meaning. Google is making the tool open source, so that anybody can use it for free.\nBut it will probably go down in history because of its silly name. Google said that the name \u2013 a \nBut beyond the name, Google\u2019s new technology could change the way that artificial intelligence understands language forever.\nMr McParseface is the English language implementation of SyntaxNet, a technology that has also been put into the public domain. Both are meant as ways of better understanding the function of language, and by doing so enable computers to better be able to speak to people.\nThe development of the technology is key to making computers able to understand what people say to them. Since language can be so illogical, computers can have a tough time actually working out what people are telling them, but Google\u2019s new tools attempt to overcome that.\n\u201cOne of the main problems that makes parsing so challenging is that human languages show remarkable levels of ambiguity,\u201d Google said as it launched the new tools. \u201cIt is not uncommon for moderate length sentences \u2013 say 20 or 30 words in length \u2013 to have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible syntactic structures.\n\u201cA natural language parser must somehow search through all of these alternatives, and find the most plausible structure given the context.\u201d\nAt the moment, SyntaxNet and Parsey McParseface have a relatively limited understanding of how sentences work, far from any comparison with a human adult. But because they are built using machine learning, the algorithms will be able to train themselves and so get better at understanding as they are used.", "Facebook has responded to \nThe company has come under fire over the last week for allegedly encouraging the humans involved in the trending module to avoid stories from conservative outlets and promote progressive ones like Black Lives Matter. It has repeatedly denied that it has manipulated that algorithm and has now laid out precisely how it works, in an attempt to stop further outrage.\nIt has also said that it has protections in place to ensure that it shows off \u201cthe most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum\u201d. It said that its team aren\u2019t allowed to suppress particular political perspectives or to prioritise one ideological viewpoint.\nIn order to try and shut down the criticism, Facebook laid out the steps that a story goes through when it is on its way to the Trending Topics bar.\nThe company starts by using a special algorithm that identifies topics that have spiked in popularity on Facebook, it said. That looks out for things that people are talking about a lot, and a lot more, and then shows them to its team.\nThe same algorithm also scans a huge list of websites for stories that are breaking, so that the site can watch out for news. Doing so presumably means that it doesn\u2019t have to wait until people start talking about a topic, but can identify it before they do.\nThings that the algorithm picks out are shown to members of Facebook\u2019s \u201cTrending team\u201d, it said.\nThey are required to perform a series of checks, which includes ensuring that the topic is a news event, rather than just a lot of people saying they are about to eat lunch, and that it has been corroborated by reporting from a list of news outlets. They also categorise news to say what sort of topic it is about and how important it is.\nThat is then fed back into another algorithm that personalises news for each person.

At the moment it is owned entirely by the Saudi Arabian government, but next year, if all goes to plan, anyone in the rest of the world will be able to buy a share in it.\u00a0\nThe numbers are huge. Aramco pumps 12 per cent of the world\u2019s oil supplies, five times as much as the largest non-state owned oil company, ExxonMobil. It sits on the world\u2019s largest oil reserves. Potentially it will become the world\u2019s most valuable company, with some people suggesting that it will be worth five times that of Apple. Even if only 5 per cent of the company is floated initially, as is the plan, that will still make the offer the largest that the world has ever seen. It will be the world\u2019s largest privatisation by far. And so on.\nAnything of this size is going to change, if not the world, at least the country, the region and the energy industry. So what might it mean?\nThere are at least three stories here. One is Saudi Arabia\u2019s need to reduce dependence on oil, and to use its oil wealth to finance diversification. A second is the impact of this on global finance. And a third, going beyond economics, is the effect on the Middle East more generally.\nThe Saudi problem is a familiar one, where dependence on a single industry crowds out other activities. It has been dubbed the Dutch Disease, because when North Sea gas was first developed by the Netherlands, it pushed up wages and other costs and made the rest of the economy uncompetitive. The Netherlands coped because it had a strong civic society and, in any case, the energy industry never dominated to the extent that it does in Saudi Arabia or indeed Russia. To counter this the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince, Muhammed bin Salman, announced the Vision 2030 plan, which involves raising money by selling part of Aramco to fund other industries and to build up what it aims to become the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund. Thus, part of the money is reinvested in the country and part invested abroad.\u00a0\nThe intention is admirable, and if the recent plunge in the oil price says anything it is that it is too dangerous to rely on a single industry. Critics have noted that this is very much a government-driven top-down project rather than a market-driven bottom-up one, but it is hard to see quite how the country can do anything other than this to get the economy to diversify. Prince Salman, who is 30 and a leader of the next generation of the ruling royal family, suggests investment in tourism, health care, manufacturing, and education. One aim is to increase the private sector\u2019s share of the economy from 40 per cent to 65 per cent. If this happens, Saudi Arabia will become more \u201cnormal\u201d, more like the diversified economies of, for example, Oman. That will inevitably change the character of the nation too.\u00a0\nThe second issue, the impact on global finance, falls into two parts: the sale itself, and the build up of the sovereign wealth fund. As far as the sale is concerned this will be a test as to how much investors want to put into a mature industry. There is of course a huge debate as to the speed at which the world economy can get away from fossil fuels. But oil and gas are less threatened than coal \u2013 they are somewhat cleaner for a start. So we will see to what extent investors will put money into this industry, given the additional factor of political risk on top of environmental risk.\u00a0\nAs for the sovereign wealth fund, well, it exists already, and this clutch of investors has already shaken up world markets. Sovereign funds can take a long-term view that most investment vehicles can\u2019t. They can also take moral stands: Norway is divesting of its holdings in the coal industry on environmental grounds. Saudi Arabia has already considerable power as an investor. If all goes to plan that power will become much greater. We have become used in Britain to have much of our investment, particularly in property, to be financed by foreigners. That balance will shift even further.\nFinally there is the impact on the region. If the Saudi economy becomes more broadly-based, more \u201cnormal\u201d, then that will affect its neighbours. At a practical level, if this proves an effective way to raise funds, expect other governments controlling national oil companies to sell off some of those shares too. This will mean greater scrutiny of their activities, because if you sell shares to global investors you have to comply with international accounting and legal standards. What happens at Aramco will become a modernising force for the region. Is the unequivocally positive? Well, probably, yes.\nThere is a final twist to this tale. The world\u2019s largest privatisation will cap what must be Britain\u2019s largest intellectual export over the past 50 years, the big idea developed in the UK that has been imitated around the world. The first big share sale was that of British Petroleum, begun in 1976 by Denis Healey, the Labour Chancellor. The precursor of BP was the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, based in Iran just across the Gulf from the precursor of Aramco, an offshoot of Standard Oil group, now ExxonMobil. So the first major privatisation was of an oil company that struck oil on one side of the Gulf, and the biggest one will be of an oil company that stuck oil on the other."], "voices": ["I read with interest earlier about my former force Greater Manchester Police today apologising\u00a0for making a fake suicide bomber shout the words \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (\u201cGod is great\u201d) during a counter-terrorism training exercise last night at a major shopping mall.\nI then read comments from white people asking why the force had to apologise since, after all, it was a realistic exercise and Islamic terrorism is a genuine threat. However, it seems to me that that is dramatically missing the point.\nThose who have condemned the language used have been right. It's about the racial stereotyping of a particular group, and the insidiousness of low level prejudice we learn through language. However, I don\u2019t expect everyone to understand this. Ask yourself a question, though: did the fake bomber shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d actually add anything to the training event? Of course not.\nAll that happened was that a minority group society now routinely sees as the enemy was put under the spotlight again. The outraged comments accruing online that argue GMP shouldn\u2019t have apologised are filled with Islamophobic hate. This, if anything, is proof of just how high community tensions are running between different racial groups.\nIn an environment like this, it\u2019s important for the police to keep an open dialogue with Muslims, and not to be seen to stand in opposition to them. Use of a common Islamic phrase during a mock terrorist attack undermines efforts that have been made to engage with the ethnic minorities they\u2019ve struggled to connect with for a long time.\nApologising after the horse has bolted is all very well. But as a former counter-terrorism officer in London and detective with Manchester, I know this exercise would have taken months of planning. Greater Manchester Police itself has confirmed that plans for the exercise were in the works since last December. It\u2019s really astonishing that nobody questioned the impact that the words might have on relations between community groups at any point during this period.\nThe force\u2019s own police and crime commissioner Tony Lloyd has said, \u201cIt is frustrating the operation has been marred by the ill-judged, unnecessary and unacceptable decision by organisers to have those playing the parts of terrorists to shout 'Allahu Akbar' before setting off their fake bombs.\u201d\nIn its defence, GMP\u2019s assistant chief constable Garry Shewan said, \u201cIt is a necessity for agencies including the police to train and prepare using exercises such as this, so that we would be in the best possible position to respond in the event that the unthinkable happened and an attack took place.\u201d But the unthinkable isn\u2019t something only committed by Muslims.\nApart from pushing away minority communities, there\u2019s something equally dangerous at stake here. When we focus on the risk posed by one group of people, we take our eye off other challenges that we might face. I know from serving in the two forces that threats to the UK come from all walks of life. Our current obsession with Islam is pointlessly reductive.\nWe only have to look at the Islamophobia surrounding Sadiq Khan during his campaign for London Mayor, and the wording used by his fellow politicians to describe him, to see the ridiculous lengths we are willing to go to in defending Islamophobic sentiment. Of course it is crucial the police and security services protect us from those who might want to cause harm and destruction. But are we really ready to say that any threat posed now only comes from one group of people? That isn\u2019t just prejudiced \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly na\u00efve.", "I hate to be a sandcastle-kicking killjoy, but isn\u2019t there something just slightly excessive about Tamara Ecclestone\u2019s daughter\u2019s \u00a310,000 playhouse?\nMaybe it\u2019s the fact that it looks about the same size as my rented London flat.

Did I show any interest in Polly Pocket, a set of My Little Ponies or a lovingly compiled dressing-up box? Did I hell. Hemp the dead stoat was my favourite toy, and I was going to take him to nursery wrapped in an old yellow rag whether it was social suicide for my mother or not.\nI refuse to believe that Sophia, darling offspring of Tamara Ecclestone, is a squeaky clean two-year-old who only shows an interest in designer sunglasses, adorable mini furniture and eye-wateringly expensive playhouses.

On reflection, the mortal post-Brexit enemy he has in mind is almost certainly Luxembourg. Truth be told, most are shamefully ignorant about that tiny lowland nation.

Translated, this means: \u201cDon\u2019t for one second think the US will lift a finger to help if you become an (even more) irrelevant little island runt.\u201d\nThe timing of this, so close on the heels of Cameron\u2019s warning, is uncanny. So uncanny that, noting the spelling of globalised with an \u00a0\u2018s\u2019 rather than a \u2018z\u2019, one might\u00a0wonder whether the letter was in fact composed by an English hand.\u00a0Possibly in Downing Street?\nBut time is short, and I must leave you now for the garden spade, because there\u2019s an Anderson bomb shelter to be dug in the back garden.\u00a0\nAs this phoney war drags on, the mighty forces of Luxembourg are massing across the Channel. And which of us would trust either the appeaser Cameron or Private IDS Godfrey of the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard to keep us safe from those?", "Emma Watson, eh? Who would have thought it? All that moralising on the world stage, standing up for the rights of women, speaking out about the devastating economic and social effects of gender inequality. And it turns out that she\u2019s been part of the global elite all along, a one percenter happily squirrelling away her millions in an offshore tax haven in the British Virgin Isles.\u00a0\nOf course, her people explain that the arrangements are purely to protect her privacy. But\u00a0blow me down with a feather. What \nThe answer to that should be: absolutely nothing. The fact that a woman has a public position on one matter \u2013 gender equality \nWhen the news that Watson, reportedly worth $70m, had used a company registered offshore to purchase a home, out came the angry rants. \u201cI thought you're the most honest actress in the world! Wrong,\u201d posted one fan \nThen came the snarky puns: Harry Potter and the Deathly Havens; Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Taxaban; Harry Potter and the Half-blood Principal Investor. There\u2019s a lot more where that came from.\nThe aforementioned\u00a0spokesperson for Watson claimed that the actor had not used an offshore haven to avoid tax or any of her other financial responsibilities as a British citizen, but instead to protect her privacy, given her celebrity status. Reassuring for her disappointed fans perhaps, but it makes no material difference whatsoever.\nEven if the young film star had deliberately hidden her assets away in an attempt to legally avoid tax, she is no hypocrite and she does not deserve to be treated like one. You may morally object to tax havens, but there\u2019s no reason to be any more angered by Watson\u2019s financial\u00a0affairs than those of the Cameron family, Sarah Ferguson, Michel Platini, Simon Cowell or Heather Mills.\nWhat is driving the disproportionate reaction to Watson\u2019s British Virgin Islands connection\u00a0is a bizarre sense that our public figures represent whatever we think they ought to, rather than what they want to, and what they actually do. Because she is outspoken on one social issue, we expect Watson to be a model activist in every other political arena, a whiter-than-white every woman who stands up for us us all. That\u2019s a standard that\u2019s impossible for anyone to live up to.\nIt\u2019s a sentiment we see echoed when gay and ethnic minority figures, or even bohemians such as the artist Tracy Emin, express their support for the Conservatives. Surely they should be on the political left, where they \u2018ought\u2019 to belong?\nThe Black Lives Matter movement in the US has prompted similarly\u00a0pointless soul-searching. Why have rap stars such as Drake and Jay Z \u2013 leading black figures in US popular culture \u2013 remained so quiet on the matter in their music? Writing in \nWhat we struggle to cope with is the idea of pop stars, actors or other national figures behaving in ways other than what we might expect from their PR-designed public persona. It\u2019s a position that doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. Each and every one of us has friends or relatives who are passionate about one social issue but ambivalent about another. The environmental activist who is aiming to produce zero waste may have no view whatsoever on the closure of domestic violence services for women; the Hillsborough campaigner who spent 27\u00a0years fighting for justice for the 96 may have never thought twice about cuts to disability benefit for those unable to work. So what?\u00a0The latter does not take away from the significance of their efforts on the former.\nEmma Watson is a wealthy young actor who has used her not inconsiderable global influence to start an important conversation about the position of women in the world. For that, she is rightly celebrated. She is not, and has never been, a tax justice campaigner.\u00a0\nI don\u2019t like the idea of any wealthy individual finding ways around paying their due ", "If I were a Jeremy Corbyn supporter I'd be furious. I would think that David Cameron is a monster who is destroying this country and I'd see \nSo I would have been disappointed with the Labour leader today, because I would have had an inkling that Cameron did not come across quite as badly as I think he should have done.\u00a0\nCorbyn started with a populist touch by wishing David Attenborough a happy 90th birthday and then paused to glare at Conservative MPs heckling him to say, \u201cI haven\u2019t asked a question yet.\u201d He hadn\u2019t, and he never really did.\u00a0\nHis first non-question was about the EU Posting of Workers Directive. The European Commission wants to close loopholes in it, to \u201cstop employers exploiting foreign workers and undercutting national rates of pay\u201d. There was a question-mark at the end of the \nIf Cameron was puzzled, he managed to hide it. He was all for workers\u2019 rights, he said. After all, his Government had brought in the National Living Wage.\u00a0\nThis prompted Corbyn to go off the script that had been written for him and to defend Labour\u2019s record: \u201cThe national minimum wage was introduced by Labour. The National Living Wage proposed by the Prime Minister\u2019s friend the Chancellor is, frankly, a corruption of the very idea. It is not, in reality, a proper living wage.\u201d\nEveryone knows what Corbyn meant. The Government\u2019s Living Wage is higher than Labour\u2019s minimum wage, but it is not as high as the living wage advocated by the Living Wage Campaign. But what was the point of bringing that up? To draw attention to the Conservatives\u2019 theft of a core Labour policy?\u00a0\nCorbyn realised he had blundered and tried to clarify \u2013 \u201cI support a wage rise, obviously\u201d \u2013 before asking his third non-question, a ramble about tax havens. By the time he got to his fifth question, he put his head down and just read out his script: whether Conservative Members of the European Parliament would be voting for \u201ccountry-by-country tax transparency reporting\u201d.\u00a0\nCameron said he supported the proposals, although I suspect he was the only other person in the Chamber who knew what Corbyn was talking about, although he failed to say whether Tory MEPs supported them too.\u00a0\nBut if that is the weakest point in the Prime Minister\u2019s defences today, Corbyn was not going to be carried shoulder high back to his office for identifying it.\u00a0\nIf I were a particularly partisan Corbyn supporter, I would have noticed that Cameron did not satisfactorily answer many of the questions asked of him, by the Labour leader and \u2013 rather more obviously \u2013 by other Labour MPs such as Jess Phillips and Keir Starmer. And I might have gone on Facebook or Twitter to condemn the mainstream media for failing to report that the Prime Minister didn\u2019t answer about tax havens, child refugees, women\u2019s refuges and the London housing market.\u00a0\nBut I would secretly have wished that Corbyn was better at asking short questions that Cameron didn\u2019t want to be asked, better at thinking on his feet, and better at using the theatrical props of humour, variety and rhetoric to embarrass the Prime Minister. I would not admit it to anyone, but I would know media bias against him is not enough of an excuse.", "What is that humming sound coming from somewhere above your head? According to a report from the consulting firm PwC, it is a drone, coming to take your job. Not all of them will look like the four-rotor gadgets people use in their local park twice and then put away in the attic because they are a bit pointless. The report forecasts that intelligent robots will replace up to $127bn (\u00a388bn)\u00a0worth of human labour over the next four years worldwide.\u00a0\nThe most important sector is infrastructure (which makes sense given the cost of putting up scaffolding), followed by agriculture. It may be a while before driverless cars are let loose on the roads, but a driverless tractor could plough a field without putting anyone at risk.\u00a0\nEven so, transport is the third category. Those of us who may have been alarmed by\u00a0Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s announcement in the Budget this year that the Government was going to allow trials of \u201ctruck platooning\u201d on Britain\u2019s motorways will have to start getting used to the idea.\u00a0\nIn fourth place comes security, which is surely a welcome chance to reduce the numbers working in the most boring job after supermarket till assistant:\u00a0security guard.\u00a0\nWe are a little concerned, however, that \u201cmedia and entertainment\u201d is fifth on the list, with $8.8bn (\u00a36bn)\u00a0of robotised work. Do they mean us?\u00a0\nBut we also note one omission. The sector \u201cconsultancy and forecasting\u201d is missing from the the list. We suspect that, from a firm with a name like PwC, the report has been produced by a highly intelligent machine.", "In 1860 the British army looted and then burned down the Chinese emperor\u2019s great Summer Palace, north of Beijing.\n\u201cThe great, the essential aim of our policy was to make all China realise that we were immeasurably the stronger, the more powerful nation\u201d said Field Marshal Wolseley. That was pretty rude behaviour.\nIn the grand sweep of Sino-British relations the Queen\u2019s comments this week are, frankly, as significant as a single rotten grain in a warehouse of rice. Does the Chinese leadership really care that Her Majesty was caught on camera remarking on the \u201crude\u201d behaviour of the Chinese delegation during Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit last year?\nUp to a (very minor) point. They probably care to the extent that other people care. They will care if it looks like they have lost \u201cface\u201d over the incident. But the affair will probably not be keeping the Communist leadership in Beijing up at night.\nThe military crisis in the South China Sea, the on-going stand-off with Japan over the Diaoyu islands and, of course, a domestic debt burden exploding towards 300 per cent of GDP will matter rather more to the Standing Committee of the Politburo than a bit of tut-tutting at a Buckingham Palace Garden Party.\nYes, a BBC report of the Queen\u2019s words was censored in China. But this is nothing unusual. Anyone who has tried to watch Western news output in mainland China will be very familiar with the sudden and unexplained hiatus. Often the most innocuous of items are blocked. No Chinese censor was ever fired for being over-zealous.\nThe rudeness of Chinese officials needs to be put in bit of context too. Try launching a protest in Tiananmen Square, or circulating an online petition calling for democratic reform on the mainland. Then you\u2019ll see what heavy-handed behaviour really looks like. It\u2019s somewhat bizarre that people expect courtly manners from representatives of a repressive autocracy.\nAs far as Western relations go, what really does anger Beijing is when senior British politicians meet with the Dalai Lama, or when China is publicly pressed over its human rights record. These are seen as matters directly related to Chinese domestic security \u2013 the Communist regime\u2019s overriding pre-occupation. Those who try it can expect a very rude response indeed from Beijing.", "The richer a country is, the less likely it is to be corrupt. And the reverse, sadly, is true too. At the top of Transparency International\u2019s index of countries having the lowest levels of corruption come Denmark, Finland and Sweden. At the bottom are Afghanistan, Somalia and North Korea.\nCorrelation is not causation, but anyone looking at the data would find it hard not to conclude that reducing corruption is likely to increase both a country\u2019s wealth and the welfare of its people. If\u00a0the London conference this week does result in reductions in corruption around the world, then it deserves a great deal of credit. And Transparency International deserves credit too for focusing attention on the issue. It is worth noting, by the way, that though it is based in Berlin, its largest single funder as far as I can see from its accounts is the British taxpayer.\nIt\u2019s true that conferences and statistics do not change behaviour. They can nudge, maybe, but they can\u2019t shift. However, the detail of the corruption index does give clues towards a way forward, as well as warnings about the difficulties ahead.\nFor a start, it is all about perceived corruption in the public sector. It is not about tax policy or tax competition. It is not about adherence to the rule of law. It is not even about personal corruption, either of individuals or corporations. People who bundle a whole host of other social or economic objectives into a general anti-corruption pot are doing a disservice. You will achieve much more if you focus. Fix the public sector and other things will follow.\nNext, you have to be honest about the societal context within which corruption can thrive. One of the fascinating features of the corruption index is the way in which some countries feature higher than you would expect, given their location, wealth, and social backdrop. For example, Singapore is right up near the top of the league at number eight, higher than the UK at equal tenth. Hong Kong is ranked 18, equal to the US and Ireland. Yet mainland China is right down at 86, a little below India and Zambia.\nBy and large, European countries are at the top and African ones at the bottom. But within Europe, Italy is down at 61, just below Ghana. Indeed, Ghana fares vastly better that its near neighbour, Nigeria, and is a success story that is not told often enough. Within Africa, Namibia and Lesotho score even better.\u00a0And then in Europe there are strange anomalies. Estonia does well, the same as France at 23rd. But the other two Baltic states, Lithuania and Latvia, are toward the bottom of the European league. Countries can learn a lot from their neighbours.\nThere is a further dimension. It is the association between freedom from corruption and economic freedom more generally. The Heritage Foundation in Washington does an index of economic freedom, which puts Hong Kong and Singapore at the top. Five of the top 10 in the Transparency index are also in the top 10 of the Heritage one. One sad country, North Korea, is at the bottom of both. This connection makes sense because economic repression tends to create opportunities and incentives for corruption: to get round onerous regulations, people bribe the officials whose job it is to impose them.\nThere are of course differences between the two league tables, for they are measuring different things. Cuba scores badly on economic freedom but not too badly on corruption. Scandinavia does better on corruption than on freedom. But it is intriguing, is it not, that a broadly centre-left NGO based in Europe produces a league table that is not dissimilar from a broadly centre-right one based in the US? The reason is that they are both trying to measure the quality of governance, albeit with somewhat different metrics.\nThat surely points to a way forward. There are all sorts of things wrong with the world and there always will be. But if a country can lift its general level of governance, then the chances are that it will also improve the overall condition of its citizens, their welfare as well as their wealth. Curbing corruption in the public sector is a very good place to start. That applies even to countries that think of themselves as having a relatively incorrupt public sector. As Transparency International observes: \u201cNot one single country, anywhere in the world, is corruption-free.\u201d", "When Kenya\u2019s Foreign Affairs secretary Karanja Kibicho announced plans to close the country\u2019s refugee camps on security grounds this week, he threw down a challenge to world leaders. Acknowledging that the decision \u201cwill have adverse effects on the lives of refugees\u201d he said the international community \u201cmust collectively take responsibility [for] humanitarian needs that will arise out of this action.\"\nHis frustration with the abject failure of the international community to deal with the global refugee crisis was plain, but he won\u2019t be the only one to feel it. His is one of just seven countries \u2013 the others are Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, Iran, Jordan and Ethiopia - hosting half of the world\u2019s refugee population of 15 million. If you include Palestinian refugees, that number leaps to over 20 million.\nOver 600,000 people live in refugee camps in Kenya - mostly in Kakuma and Dadaab, the latter being the biggest in the world and home to more than 50,000 children under the age of four. The majority are of Somali origin \u2013 a country ravaged by conflict for over 20 years.\nSadly, it\u2019s not just Kenya where the authorities are promoting this security narrative when it comes to refugees, and it is one that can have fatal consequences. Across Europe fences have gone up at borders to stop refugees moving through, and to \u201cprotect national security\u201d. Turkey recently sealed its border, effectively trapping\nAnd this security rhetoric is hardly accidental. Ratcheting up the fear factor hardens public attitudes against refugees and potentially stokes hostility towards people fleeing often the same violence and terror governments are seeking to combat. Painting them as \u2018the other\u2019 and as a threat to \u2018our\u2019 security is a convenient way for governments to push public opinion from sympathy to antipathy.\nThe UK government has stated its intention to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for immigrants. When Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond referred to \u201cmarauding\u201d migrants last year, and the Prime Minister called those risking their lives to cross the Med as a \u201cswarm\u201d, dismissing those stuck in the miserable refugee camp in Calais as a \u201cbunch of migrants\u201d, they were attempting to do just that.\nIn September the UN will announce a plan for the resettlement of 10 per cent of the world\u2019s refugees and other measures to deal with the crisis. World leaders must support and implement this plan. If they don\u2019t, the crisis will simply deepen as ever more people are forced to journey further searching for safety.", "Britain's Eurosceptics have spent years frightening people with the idea of an 'EU army' and the subject is once again rearing its head in the referendum campaign.\nConspiracy-minded Brexiteers insist that, were the UK to stay in the European Union, British troops might soon be faced with conscription into a Brussels-controlled army.\nMore sober Eurosceptics warn that \"\nIt\u2019s true that a few lofty proposals have been aired in the last 50 years by various member states and by the most federalist minded among EU elites. Last March, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker advocated a common European army as a means to increase the EU\u2019s standing on the world stage, not least in the eyes of Russia. And it has recently been reported that the forthcoming German defence white paper may also propose an EU army in the context of a \u201cdefence union\u201d.\nBut the reality of European defence co-operation does not match the rhetoric. The EU carries out humanitarian and rescue tasks, crisis management and peace-keeping under a common security and defence policy. This does not extend to collective defence of EU territory \u2013 nor does any EU government seriously envisage it ever doing so. Nato already plays that role.\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has urged Europeans to avoid duplicating the organisation as money invested in an EU army would be money lost for the alliance. In recent years, Central and Eastern European states that see US capabilities as a vital hedge against an aggressive Russia have also expressed their strong preference for Nato. They are unlikely to give up this resistance anytime soon.\nIn fact, EU member states do not want to cede sovereignty on defence policy at all.\u00a0 Decisions on defence and foreign policy require unanimity in the Council of Ministers.\u00a0That means every single EU country has a veto \u2013 and that is why David Cameron has rightly referred to the suggestion of an EU army as \u201cfanciful\u201d.\nIn practical terms, the lack of a shared vision of how to use EU forces would also be an enormous problem in a crisis.\nAn EU army could only work with a common budget, common institutions, and a supranational defence authority that could over-rule decisions by national parliaments. That is unimaginable to even the staunchest supporter of EU integration.\nSome countries enjoy strong collaboration on defence, but integration is only possible because of long-standing ties, shared equipment and similar defence cultures. Without these similarities, integration becomes much more difficult. Such models of cooperation could not be scaled up to a European level.\nThe political will is simply not there. Paris would rather get the rest of Europe to support French operations in Mali and the Sahel. Ireland secured a protocol to the Lisbon Treaty stating explicitly that the treaty did not provide for the creation of an EU army.\nAnd, importantly, there is also less to Germany's alleged commitment to creating an EU Army than may appear at first sight. It is considered good form for a \u201cgood European\u201d in Germany to reaffirm the commitment to a European army \u2013 but no one in Berlin is drawing up implementation plans.\nIt is disingenuous for Eurosceptics to present something that only ultra-federalists dream about in very vague terms as something plausible, let alone imminent and inevitable.\nThe British people need to decide whether they are better off in or out of the EU as it actually \nInvoking the EU army ahead of the referendum is scaremongering at its worst and adds nothing to the real debate we need to have.", "Earlier this week, it was revealed that a man who targeted five female victims, including a 15-year-old girl, with \u2018revenge porn\u2019 \nData suggests that this sad case represents a widespread problem in which police fail to prosecute for \u2018revenge porn\u2019. In 61 per cent of cases reported to the police, \nA possible reason for this could be how revenge porn encapsulates many archaic rape myths, distilled into new and technologically advanced forms. Since time immemorial, societies have done their best to insist that sexual abuse doesn\u2019t really hurt its victims beyond short-term physical damage. Misguided tropes fail to understand that sexual violence is not always about physical harm and more often about psychological trauma, personal autonomy and human dignity.\nIn the 1970s, when child sexual abuse was finally acknowledged by doctors and legislators, public opinion was split over whether it mattered. It was argued that because many children were not physically wounded by the rapes that happened to them in the family, it was somehow less significant or damaging than stereotypical, violent \u201cstranger jumping out of the alleyway\u201d rapes.\nFeminists successfully argued that it was not solely blood or bruising which represented the harm of rape, but the psychological impact as well. Thankfully, this is now accepted by most people and is reflected in most legislation around the world.\nWith revenge porn, feminists face a similar barrier. There may be complacency in the criminal justice system and wider society because many assume that sexual offences carried out with a computer by someone thousands of miles away are somehow not truly \u2018real\u2019 because a victim has not been physically hurt. But the harm incurred goes much further than this.\nOur criminal justice system and wider society already struggle far too often to see victims of sexual offences as \u2018real people\u2019 or to acknowledge their pain and trauma as valid. Technology assisted sexual offenders can exploit this tension to commit crimes such as revenge porn, knowing they may not be held to account in the same way as perpetrators of other crimes due to their seemingly abstract nature.\nIt\u2019s a bleak but crucial reminder that the fight against sexual violence is nowhere near being declared won. Rather, where old loopholes have been identified and closed, new ones evolve and emerge. The next battle appears to be insisting on human compassion in an increasingly abstract and digital age; these crimes still harm their victims, whether or not it\u2019s from behind a screen.", "Only Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s operation could bury good news. It does it regularly. In contrast, Downing Street cynically copies an episode of TV\u2019s \nIt was no coincidence that the Government dropped plans to force all schools to become academies on a Friday \u2013 the best day to bury embarrassing news because newspapers have early deadlines. George Osborne\u2019s retreats over pension reforms and disability benefit cuts also happened on a Friday.\nCorbyn somehow managed to announce Labour\u2019s inquiry into anti-Semitism at 8.07pm on a Friday.\u00a0As a result, most of the next day\u2019s papers had negative headlines on the issue. They would have been neutralised if journalists been briefed a\u00a0few hours earlier. \u00a0\nLast autumn, I complained when a Saturday speech by Corbyn was released far too late on a Friday to secure much space in the next day\u2019s Independent. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Corbyn\u2019s office assured me. Seven days on, another Saturday speech arrived \u2013 an hour later than the previous one.\u00a0I know this sounds like trivial gossip from the Westminster village\u00a0but on each occasion, incompetence prevented Corbyn from getting positive media coverage.\nIt happens daily.\nI understand why Team Corbyn do not exactly love the media. Most newspapers are hostile and his early coverage as leader \u2013 fictitious \u201csnubs\u201d to the Queen, untrue policy stories (\u201cCorbyn to abolish the Army\u201d) \u2013 reinforced a bunker mentality. Corbyn had won an incredible victory in the Labour leadership election on a wave of support through social media, so it was natural to treat the mainstream media with a long spoon. He also recoiled from the media spin to which New Labour was addicted.\nBut it is now clear that Labour under Corbyn is cutting off its nose to spite its face. Under him, Labour\u2019s relations with the media are as bad as I have seen for any party in 34 years as a Westminster journalist. Treating virtually all the media as the enemy-- including broadcasters who have a duty to be impartial \u2013 is counterproductive. Last week, broadcasters held peace talks with Corbyn aides but left the meeting frustrated and with little hope of improved co-operation. Corbyn is tetchy when he is door-stepped at his Islington home, sometimes putting his hand over a TV camera. It looks awful to viewers. For his own and his party\u2019s sake, he has got to learn to smile when he doesn\u2019t feel like it. That\u2019s leadership.\nCorbyn allies claim a hostile \u201cmedia narrative\u201d against their man sets him up to fail and gives him no credit when he does not. They argue that the \u201cright-wing media\u201d is in denial about the shifting centre of gravity in British politics shown by Corbyn\u2019s election, portraying him as an insurgent rather than the leader of a new politics.\nThey have a point. And yet the Corbynistas\u2019 tactics appear very old politics. They launched an online petition calling for Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC\u2019s Political Editor, to be sacked for her coverage of last week\u2019s election results. It was taken down by the campaign group 38 Degrees after abusive misogynist comments were added, some calling her a \u201cwhore\u201d and a \u201cbitch.\u201d For me, her election reports were accurate and balanced, as they always are.\nThe council results in England showed that Labour is not appealing to the voters it must win round, including Conservative voters at last year\u2019s general election. To his credit, Corbyn acknowledged the results were \u201cmixed\u201d when he addressed Labour MPs on Monday, and that his party it would need to attract voters from all other parties to win the 2020 election.\nBut Corbyn could learn a lot from Sadiq Khan, who marked his election as Mayor of London with a call for Labour to be a \u201cbig tent that appeals to everyone \u2013\u00a0not just its activists\u201d, a dig at Corbynistas keener to win power in the party than the country. Khan ran a professional election operation and has made a very good start at City Hall. He was sworn in at a multi-faith ceremony at Southwark Cathedral and his first engagement as mayor was to attend a Holocaust Remembrance event \u2013 a symbolic statement that he will rebuild bridges with the Jewish community, who once regarded Labour as their natural home. Where was Corbyn?\nKhan kept remarkably cool under fire during a nasty campaign by the Tories and their newspaper allies which accused him of giving cover to Islamic extremists. Khan won the media\u2019s respect as a result: Corbyn should take note.\nThere is another reason why the Labour leader should sharpen up his act. True, he is never going to win round the Labour MPs determined to oust him before the 2020 election. But to see off the inevitable attempted coup, he must retain his support among Labour members and supporters. To do that, Corbyn needs to run a more professional and competent operation. Labour members will not turn against him because of his policies, but they might do if they think he is not capable of winning power.", "Corruption can take root whenever self-interest and opportunity meet, but it requires secrecy in order to flourish.\nAs the publication of the Panama papers showed, there\u00a0are currently too many hiding places around the world where money derived from illegal activities can be placed beyond the gaze of the governments and institutions whose job it is to stamp out corruption.\nIf dirty cash can\u2019t be seen it cannot be tracked and its origins are easy to obscure. That is why we need urgent action on tax havens. If they can\u2019t be closed, then they must show the same commitment to transparency that other financial centres have been forced to adopt (albeit, in some cases, reluctantly).\nThat is the message David\u00a0Cameron needs to deliver to world leaders when he hosts the anti-corruption summit in London on Thursday. There are three steps the Prime Minister can take this week that will make a genuine and lasting difference in the fight against corruption.\nFirst, he needs to acknowledge that\u00a0tax havens based in British territories cannot end\u00a0their dependency on the\u00a0financial services industry overnight.\u00a0In many cases, banking and finance are a legacy of our presence in countries that were once part of the British Empire. Cameron should acknowledge they may\u00a0need financial assistance to diversify economically and\u00a0enable alternative industries to take hold.\nTurning a blind eye to the damage corruption causes in the developing world inflicts further\u00a0misery on\u00a0some of the most deprived populations on the planet, by\u00a0allowing money that would otherwise be spent on vital\u00a0infrastructure and public services to line the pockets of a few.\u00a0\nBaroness Patricia Scotland, the Commonwealth General Secretary, has said overseas aid should be conditional on member countries meeting strict anti-corruption standards. But far more needs to be done. In our own country, the tax authorities have been starved of money and personnel. In poorer countries the situation is infinitely worse.\u00a0\nThe Prime Minister needs to work towards an agreement from world leaders on\u00a0Thursday to fund\u00a0a\u00a0team of global auditors and tax collectors.\u00a0\nThe Prime Minister must also acknowledge that tax avoidance is not a problem for the developing world alone. In the UK we must stamp out corruption by committing to a public register of beneficial ownership of all properties in the UK and have a system that allows us all to see who owns the companies that operate here.\nThis week, the Government confirmed once again that it has no plans to force crown dependencies to reveal details of beneficial ownership through a public register. That is regrettable.\u00a0\nBeneficial ownership allows corrupt regimes, criminals and unscrupulous businesses to hide what they own from tax authorities and from the public. Almost every NGO believes a public register would lift the veil of secrecy which allows them to behave with impunity and without fear of being caught.\nIf David Cameron won\u2019t support a public register, he must negotiate a global agreement on Thursday that requires offshore territories to exchange information on beneficial ownership with each other and with tax authorities in other countries whenever they request it.\u00a0\nWe also\u00a0need legislation to make companies criminally liable for the actions of their employees that facilitate corruption, tax evasion, money laundering and fraud. And we also need new legal powers to strengthen the UK\u2019s assets recovery regime.\nThe joint\u00a0Ministerial Council, whose\u00a0members include\u00a0UK ministers and the\u00a0leaders of overseas\u00a0territories, need to find the political\u00a0will to act.\u00a0\nThe UK overseas territories fall under our jurisdiction and sovereignty; we provide defense and stand behind them fiscally. If something goes wrong in those territories, it is the\u00a0UK taxpayer that may end up bailing them out.\nWe must be clear: if our territories want to rely on UK armed forces and UK taxpayers, they need\u00a0to adhere\u00a0to British standards of transparency.\u00a0\nWe must send a clear message to the rest of the world that corruption on an industrial scale\u00a0will not be tolerated. David Cameron has admitted that \u2018corruption is one of the greatest enemies of progress in our time\u2019. History will not be kind to him if he fails to\u00a0make\u00a0progress on Thursday.", "According to figures released by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, since the introduction of the National Living Wage recruitment for permanent jobs has slowed down. Meanwhile, temporary and contract positions have increased, with recruitment agents seeing their contract billings increase since April. Does this mean the National Living Wage is bad for employment?\nThere could be a multitude of reasons behind this \u2013 not just the introduction of the Living Wage \u2013 \u00a0but recruitment on the permanent front has been slowing down for quite some time, and this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing for job seekers. Stay with me.\nIf you\u2019re someone who\u2019s only ever been in the jobs market during the recession era, or you were finishing off your education during the recession, it can be difficult to accept that a change like this could actually work in your favour. The default position is that any scary-sounding change in the market will cause you to become jobless, homeless and desolate within weeks \u2013 but this is no longer the case.\nFirst off,\u00a0now we\u2019re out of recession and onto more stable economic ground, there are more jobs than people to fill them. During the recession era, there were a lot of candidates scrambling for every position advertised, whereas now it is the total opposite \u2013 many jobs go unfilled. With this excess of jobs, people can afford to be choosier about where they work.\nBecause of this, job seekers are more likely to demand more money for their services now \u2013 and because quite a few sectors are facing a lack of skilled workers, people are changing companies more often and increasing their salaries as they go. The power is truly with the people in this respect, but some companies are not comfortable with coming to terms with this shift of power. It\u2019s now commonplace for positions to be left unfilled as candidates refuse to accept measly salaries for the sake of job security.\nAnd here comes the allure of contracting. People working on temporary contracts can make a lot more money on day rates, and if companies are unwilling to pay more on the permanent front, they have no choice but to bring in contract staff to fill the gaps (as we see often in the NHS). The fact that the NHS has to carry out recruitment drives abroad to tempt staff over to the UK to fill permanent positions says it all.\u00a0\nThe rise of the contractor and downfall of the permanent candidate does have something to do with the National Living Wage \u2013 it is about awareness, and we have been made aware through this legislation that we deserve to be able to live normal, acceptable lifestyles with our salaries.\nNo jobs advertised at X company for the past 3 months? It may look as though they\u2019re on a hiring freeze, but I would bet money that said company has hired multiple contract or agency staff over that time. Line managers are able to sign contractor day rates off through a number of streams \u2013 project budget and department budget \u2013 I knew one Creative Director who had been signing off his contract creative staff as stationery for years!\nSo the truth is they\u2019re actually hiring all the time \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t look like they are.\nTemp workers on contracts often see the same benefits as a permanent member of staff \u2013 discretionary sick pay, holiday pay, and increased take home pay due to the tax arrangements utilised by umbrella and LTD companies (all above board, of course).\nIn reality, then, the National Living Wage has empowered the workforce to make more economically beneficial decisions for employees, as opposed to employers, for once. It is something for companies to ponder: if they want staff that can do the job, they need to respond to this increase in hourly pay by increasing permanent salaries across the board, and coming out of this arrogant viewpoint that people should work on their terms, as opposed to their own.\nThis is an arrogance that needs to be quashed in the private sector particularly \u2013 I\u2019ve seen many an employer confused when his or her star candidate rejects an offer of employment due to the fact that they are offering way below the current market rate, and they cannot fathom it. \u201cBut I\u2019m offering them a good job! They\u2019re so ungrateful - they\u2019ve wasted my time!\u201d they lament - it is a total turning of the tables that many are refusing to accept as the new norm.\u00a0This is what national financial recovery looks like.\nThe employment market is in the hands of the employees now, and it\u2019s time that we took the opportunity to exploit this fully. As someone who recently lived in London on \u00a320,000 per annum, I know it\u2019s normal for many to have to choose between food and transport for a section of the month.\nThe new normal \u2013 where we, the workers, are able to dictate the terms, is coming. So don\u2019t let anyone tell you the National Living Wage is destroying the jobs market.", "Privatising the probation services is privatisation gone mad. That is the only conclusion you can draw from a progress report by the National Audit Office on the Government\u2019s plans, though it received little attention when recently published.\u00a0\u00a0\nYes, you read that correctly: probation services \u2013 whose main task is to rehabilitate convicted criminals so that that they do not re-offend \u2013 are being made subject to the rigours of the market.\nThink what the work of probation entails. Its essence is the establishment of a relationship between a probation officer and an offender. A good description was given by an outgoing Chief Inspector of Probation, Andrew Bridges, in 2011. I quote what he said at some length:\n\u201cThe heart of probation practice, and youth offending practice for that matter, is about using one\u2019s influencing skills in a one-to-one relationship. You are trying to use a relationship to achieve a purpose: the relationship isn\u2019t the end in itself.\n\u201cYou are trying to get individuals to want to change and to make changes to themselves. You are often doing it with offenders whose probability of change is very low, with the really difficult ones. Anybody who had been a practitioner 40 years ago would still recognise that now, I would say\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIndeed, you can go right back to the origins of probation in 1876, when a charity first appointed police court \u2018missionaries\u2019 to help offenders find work and employment, to see that the task and the method has always been the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 1907, the Probation of Offenders Act put the charitable activity onto a statutory basis. Courts could release offenders on probation. Probation officers were to \u201cadvise, assist and befriend\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nActivities based on relationships are expensive to run because they are time consuming. For example, the personal relationship that bank customers used to have with their managers has largely disappeared as digital technology has been introduced in order to reduce costs. These days, an application for a loan is more likely to be \u2018scored\u2019 by a computer than to be discussed with a member of bank staff. And since relationship banking has been replaced by transaction banking, a lack of respect for customers has become pervasive. This led to banks miss-selling financial products on an enormous scale.\nWith this example in mind \u2013 and noting also that the Government intends to pay the providers of probation services by results \u2013 I fear that the personal relationship that lies at the heart of good probation work will be first distorted and then lost.\nThe idea that probation work should become a commercial activity began to surface in the early 2000s. By then, the emphasis of the Conservative or neoliberal revolution launched in the early 1980s by Margaret Thatcher (together with Ronald Reagan in the US) had switched to public services.\nIn 2004, Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government accepted a report that recommended what was called \u201cgreater contestability\u201d using \u201cproviders of\u2026 probation from across the public, private or voluntary sectors\u201d. In 2007, probation boards began to be transformed into probation trusts, in preparation for privatisation.\nThe Coalition government quickly went a step further: providers of probation services would be paid to reduce reoffending and the savings that would accrue to the criminal justice system would pay for this. Here, however, comes a further problem.\nHow can the Government be sure that a particular probation service has been solely responsible for a reduction in re-offending in the cases it has handled? The crucial factor, for instance, could have been the remedial work done by the prison from which the offender had recently emerged.\u00a0\u00a0\nMoreover the level of crime across the country is declining and this must reflect some general trend rather than individual actions. The Crime Survey for England and Wales showed that in 2015, there was a 7 per cent decrease from the previous year.\nBrushing this problem aside, the Government has made it clear that, over time, the majority of probation trusts\u2019 current business will be opened up to competition, apart from advice to court and the management of higher risk offenders. Unfortunately the National Audit Office (NAO) report lists numerous difficulties with making such a dramatic change.\nTo start with, the computer systems on which the exercise depends are lamentably poor with no hope of early improvement. Their failings cause what the NAO calls \u201csevere inefficiencies\u201d. New tools used for assessing and allocating offenders are \u201ccumbersome and require repeated data re-entry.\u201d\nLinked to this, the performance of the new bodies cannot be reliably measured. Crucial data that would allow the success or the failure of the new policy to be judged is often simply not available.\nWorse still, there is what the NAO describes as \u201climited visibility\u201d of contract commitments. The National Probation Service itself \u201conly has copies of around 30 per cent of its contracts and does not know exactly what it spends on goods and services.\u201d\nEven more chilling, the NAO report observes that many of the successful bidders for contracts were \u201cnew to probation\u201d. Unsurprisingly, these firms did not fancy having much of their revenue tied to the results of an activity of which they knew little. So the original purpose of the entire exercise has largely been lost.\nBack in 2011, the Government said that it would \u201cpioneer a world first \u2013 a system where we only pay for results, delivered by a diverse range of providers from all sectors. This principle will underpin all our work on reoffending. This is a radical shift.\u201d A radical shift indeed, except that now it isn\u2019t going to happen.\nIndeed, one is entitled to question the merits of privatisation. What has happened in this case is that Conservative ministers and Ministry of Justice officials \u2013 few of whom have any direct experience of the business world \u2013 have been attempting to introduce market disciplines, that they do not understand, into a valuable social service of which, again, they seem to have little comprehension.\nDoctrine has replaced thought. Which is where revolutions end.", "No-one who has ever seen China\u2019s security apparatus in full flow can be in any doubt that the Queen is right: they are horrible to deal with.\nI had a small experience of this a few years back when I travelled with David Cameron on a trade mission to China designed to rebuild ties with the country\u2019s leadership after a period in the diplomatic deep freeze.\nWe had spent the day in Beijing and in the evening flew in the Prime Minister\u2019s charted Virgin plane on to Shanghai.\nAs we prepared to leave the Chinese capital we were joined on the flight by about half a dozen well built, badly suited men \u2013 who you could tell were security officials by the discreet microphones in their button holes.\nThey were scattered throughout the plane. They didn\u2019t smile. They didn\u2019t make eye contact. They didn\u2019t sit down when the plane started moving. And at the end of the flight they were up from their seats before the plane had left the runway. The rules did not apply to them.\nNow such arrivals by heads of state tend to have well laid down protocols. The Prime Minister is always the first person off the plane \u2013 but only disembarks once the welcoming party of city dignitaries and embassy staff are in place and the obligatory red carpet has been laid out to the front steps of the plane.\nThose of us at the back in steerage have to wait. And it can be a while.\nBut that is not how the Chinese security minder in our cabin saw things panning out.\nAs soon as the steps had been brought up to the back door he gesticulated to the rather effete steward that he should open it and let him off.\nThe steward demurred and very politely told him in slow English that this was not possible: he couldn\u2019t open the door until he had been given permission to do so by the cockpit.\nThe steward smiled a lot. The security agent scowled. He bent his head to look through the window and gesticulated again that the door should be opened.\nThe steward \u2013 only two thirds his size \u2013\u00a0in turn tried to gesticulate that this was not possible. And then it got nasty.\nHaving not got his way the agent began angrily screaming at the steward waving his arms around.\nHis diatribe \u2013 that none of us including the steward could understand \u2013 went on for about 30 seconds.\nAnd then something rather marvelous happened: the steward waited till he had finished and then shouted back at him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are,\u201d he screamed. \u201cI\u2019m not opening the door and you\u2019re going to have to wait.\u201d\nHe then positioned himself directly in front of the handle \u2013 blocking the exit and explicitly challenged\u00a0the man to push him out of the way.\nAnd you know what? He won. The goon shut up. And waited. For a good five minutes until Cameron was off the plane.\nAnd then when the door finally was opened and the man rushed off, the steward thanked his rapidly descending profile for flying Virgin.\nHe should get a job in the diplomatic protection service.\n\u00a0", "In the wake of the Panama papers scandal, this week\u2019s Global Anti-Corruption Summit \u2013 held in London and chaired by David Cameron \u2013 is being pitched as a chance to clean up the offshore financial services industry, much of which is located in British controlled overseas territories.\nBut as foreign diplomats arrived in the capital, the Prime Minister had already succeeded in offending\u00a0two guest nations, labelling Nigeria and Afghanistan \nCameron\u2019s un-statesmanlike comments betray an entrenched post-colonial attitude to corruption and bribery.

The Corporation and its unquestioning supporters treated the White Paper, published yesterday, as tantamount to victory - as well they might. Given the speed of transformation in the overall media landscape, however, any rejoicing is likely to be premature.\u00a0\nThe Government can be forgiven for not wanting to pick a new fight with a powerful and media-savvy constituency, when it already has quarrels with hospital doctors and teachers (plus their local authorities) on its hands. The threat of a revolt in party ranks, at a time when MPs are already riven by the EU debate, may also have been a consideration. My view, for what it is worth, is that John Whittingdale was anyway far less hostile towards the Corporation than he was portrayed. The solidity of his statement and the conviction with which he delivered it would seem to bear that out.\u00a0\nAnd I would add - just to infuriate still further those now described as the BBC\u2019s \u201cluvvies\u201d - that we have an elected government; it is a Conservative government, and it has a mandate to negotiate a new Charter. The impression has been created by numbers of highly articulate and passionate people that, as with the NHS, a Conservative government is hell-bent on destroying a prized national institution and that any move to enact change or reform is somehow illegitimate. This is sectional arrogance that reaches its logical conclusion in extra-parliamentary action.\u00a0\nThe BBC may \u201cbelong\u201d to its licence-payers, but licence-payers take different views of what it does with the money and whether, as an organisation, it should shrink, expand, or maintain the status quo. Anyone who believes that the 82 per cent of those who took part in the consultation and wrote in enthusiastic support of the status quo - reflected a similar proportion of licence-payers would do well to look at the criticisms of the White Paper (for being too generous) that appeared on the BBC website as the details came out.\u00a0\nI am not anti-BBC; far from it. I spent seven years of my early working life at the World Service, and have never dissented from the BBC\u2019s ethos and purpose. I do, however, question the extent of its ambition, and the ratio of quantity to quality. In this respect, the institutional changes announced yesterday seemed to get things pretty much right. The role of the BBC Trust was always ambiguous. A board, with a minority - repeat, minority - appointed by the Government is sensible, as is the decision to retain the current chair of the Trust, Rona Fairhead, to head the board until the end of her contract in 2018. That is not so far away, and there is virtue in some stability during the transition. The BBC will not like being subject for its regulation to Ofcom, and there were arguments that its sheer size would make it a cuckoo in Ofcom\u2019s nest. But that, too, seems a common sense solution. \u00a0\nSo do some of the details and the decisions not taken. Setting the disclosure level for executive salaries at \u00a3150k sets it at what has become the standard gauge: what the prime minister earns. Setting the disclosure level for \u201ctalent\u201d so much higher fends off a potential clash. If there was ever a plan to interfere with BBC schedules -which I doubt - there should not have been.\u00a0\nIn many other respects, however, an opportunity - or rather a whole series of opportunities - has been missed: an opportunity to streamline the BBC behind its - undoubted - public service remit; an opportunity to consider how much of the BBC\u2019s expansion, especially in the digital sphere can be justified; an opportunity to reconfigure spending in the light of the UK\u2019s increasing federalism, and the imperative to prepare for a world in which paying an annual licence fee to a broadcaster, even a public service broadcaster with the stature of the BBC, could seem as antiquated as a \u201cwindow tax\u201d.\u00a0\nAll this has been made worse by the proposal to end the freeze on the licence fee. By all means, include access to the iPlayer within the licence fee (why was it not?) and make the fee harder to evade. But the BBC now has no real need to reconsider the costs of what it is doing.\u00a0\nLess, or at least no more, money would compel what the BBC (and its \u201cluvvies\u201d) would call hard choices. But they really should not be that hard. The BBC is a public service; it is also a national - and nationally-binding - force. The Government\u2019s emphasis on serving many different communities and maintaining local radio runs against this.\nCommercial local radio stations have proved viable - they would be even more viable without competition from the BBC. The BBC should concentrate on being a national service, with federal arms (and appropriate shares of the budget) delegated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for them to administer.\u00a0\nThe BBC should not run nearly as many extra digital stations as it does, and it could use the downtime on, say, BBC4, to carry English lessons for the UK\u2019s many newcomers. The division of responsibilities of the BBC\u2019s national radio stations is much-loved, but obsolete. A dedicated radio news channel (like France-Info), which leaves Radio 5 to sport, is long overdue.\nThe website should stick to news, background, and previously broadcast material via the iPlayer. Recipes, the \u201cmagazine\u201d should go the way of the BBC\u2019s ill-judged excursion into travel publishing. This is work for others to do. The plan for the BBC somehow make it up to print journalism by helping subsidise local newspapers is patronising and misguided. If the Government is worried about the survival of the local press, it should subsidise it directly, as some other EU countries talk of doing, not through the BBC. \u00a0\nIn some ways, this highlights the bigger problem with the Corporation. Courtesy of the licence fee, it has something no other branch of the media enjoys at a time when so much in the sector is in flux. This is the huge privilege of security. And the licence fee depends not just on the government that negotiates the Charter, but on public consent. Given the speed of change, it is not impossible that this public consent could run out before the Charter does, which is why something more radical than this White Paper has not been cancelled, just postponed.\u00a0", "As the political parties calm down after last week\u2019s elections, all sensible people, included\u00a0most newspapers and many Labour MPs, have\u00a0agreed\u00a0the outcome was that Labour lost in some places,\u00a0which is a disaster for Corbyn,\u00a0and won in other places,\u00a0which is a disaster for Corbyn.\nThe Queen could be caught on camera saying, \"That Putin is a right w*****r.

Without them ever being called a friend of terrorists,\u00a0every day for a month in leaflets, they haven\u2019t been held to proper scrutiny. For\u00a0we know,\u00a0they\u2019re going backwards and forwards to Syria every weekend.\nFallon also said the Tory campaign was simply the \u201crough and tumble of politics.\u201d\u00a0This seems a reasonable way to describe 'making stuff up'. At the next election, Labour should distribute leaflets declaring that\u00a0Fallon tortures llamas\u00a0by stringing them upside down in his bedroom,\u00a0forcing them to smoke Capstan full-strength cigarettes all day.\u00a0Then he can be part of the fun of the 'rough and tumble of politics' as well.\nThe Conservatives were so much on the defensive after the London result, they announced that Zac\u00a0Goldsmith\u2019s mum had said her son was \"the\u00a0least racist person I know.\u201d\u00a0That pretty much clears it up then. The Tories are keen on scrutiny, and there\u2019s no more watertight method for holding someone up to scrutiny than asking someone\u2019s mum if their son is guilty. The problem is it\u2019s possible the only other people Zac\u2019s mum knows are Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and a biker gang from Alabama.\nAnother way of looking at the current situation is that Labour is\u00a0winning already. Every time the government announces a new policy as being vital and marvellous and exciting, a few days later they have to cancel it. The cuts in tax credits and disability benefits, and the attempt to\u00a0force all\u00a0schools to become academies, have all faced such opposition they\u2019ve been withdrawn.\nBut all sensible people agree the most effective way to support Labour is to be like one of these angry football supporters who scream their manager should be sacked if\u00a0they lose one game. Except they'll\u00a0go even further and yell:\u00a0'How dare we win the election, you're useless, sack him.'", "At least until the recent scandals in football and athletics, most people would I suspect judge that the worst corruption in the world is a problem of bad governments in developing countries. Indeed, Transparency International\u2019s (TI) \u201cCorruption Perception Index\u201d finds countries of the south consistently at the bottom levels of the Index; though TI explicitly recognises that the north is partly responsible for the corruption of the south as a bribe payer.\nThere is no doubt that there are problems of corruption in some governments in developing countries. The question is what should be done about it? Some want to wag fingers and deny any aid to some of the poorest people in the world; wiser heads understand that lots of the corruption originates in OECD countries and that it is when systems are weak \u2013 anywhere in the world \u00a0\u2013 that some people will engage in corrupt behaviour. If we want to reduce corruption then we need to strengthen preventative systems in both OECD and developing countries.\nIt is important to remember that it was not until 1996, that the OECD \u2013 the club of rich countries based in Paris \u2013 recommended that bribes paid to public officials abroad should cease to be tax deductible. And it was not until 2002 that the UK implemented this recommendation. In fact the OECD treatyrequiring countries to legislate to make corrupt payments to a public official abroad, a criminal offence, was not agreed until 1997 \u2013 less than 20 years ago. The history of how this came about is very interesting.\nAt Watergate in 1972, burglars were caught breaking into the Democrat committee headquarters and it was then discovered that this was authorised by president Nixon in order to bug the headquarters of his electoral opponents. Congress therefore set up enquiries, and during the hearings, it became clear that large amounts of cash were provided by CEOs to fund the Committee for the Re-election of the President. One thoughtful congressman asked where in the company accounts such funds were provided for. It was then discovered that 400 publicly traded major corporations had slush funds which existed to pay bribes to public officials abroad, in order to obtain contracts.\nIn the wake of the national shock revealed by the dirty dealings over Watergate, the US Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977. This made the US the first country to outlaw bribing foreign public officials abroad. After a little time, US businesses started to complain that it was unfair that others could compete through bribery and they could not. This led to a massive US effort to achieve agreement through the OECD, that countries should pass legislation to make it a criminal offence to bribe public officials abroad. The Treaty was agreed in 1997 and took effect in 1999, just over 15 years ago.\nImportantly, the OECD put in place monitoring machinery to expose countries that failed to implement the treaty requirements. The UK does not come well out of the monitoring. In 2008 the OECD Working Group said that it was \u201cdisappointed and seriously concerned\u201d about the UK's continued failure to address deficiencies in its laws on bribery of foreign public officials and on corporate liability for foreign bribery, which it said had hindered investigations. This led to a new Bribery Act being passed into law as recently as 2010. The new Act was welcomed by the OECD Working Group, but the government was being intensively lobbied by business interests over the details of implementation.\nIn February 2011 the chair of the OECD Working Group expressed his disappointment over the delay in the promised entry into force of the Act, originally promised for April 2011. At last in March 2012 the Working Group found that the UK had significantly boosted its foreign bribery enforcement efforts but needed to be more transparent when resolving cases. It also asked for a roadmap to extend the Convention to UK Overseas Territories.\nBy October 2014 Transparency International found that of the 41 countries, accounting for two thirds of world exports, that had signed the OECD Anti Bribery Convention, only four countries were \"actively investigating and prosecuting companies that cheat taxpayers when they bribe foreign officials to get or inflate contracts or obtain licenses and concessions\". Happily the UK had by then arrived at a state of grace and was found to be engaged in active enforcement alongside the US, Germany and Switzerland. The countries with little or no enforcement included Japan, The Netherlands, South Korea, Russia, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, Israel and 12 others.\nMy own experience in government included an effort in 2000/01 to halt the sale by BAE Systems of an obsolete military air traffic control system to Tanzania. This was such a bad project that it was obvious that it could only have been agreed through corruption. Tanzania had recently been granted debt relief and one of the conditions was that it should obtain no loans unless they were concessional. The air traffic control deal was funded by a loan from Barclays which obviously broke this condition.\nEventually, as part of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, it wasexposed that BAE Systems had paid \u00a38.5 million ($12.4) -- one third of the contract\u2019s value -- to a middleman in Tanzania called Shailesh Vithlani. In 2010, the company agreed to pay \u00a330 million reparations to Tanzania and was given a further fine at the Crown Court in Southwark for concealing payments \u201cfrom the auditors and ultimately the public\u201d. BAE Systems and the Serious Fraud Office argued that Vithlani had been paid to lobby for the contract. The judge said he was \u201castonished\u201d at claims BAE Systems had not acted corruptly, court records show.\n\u201cI accept...that it is not now possible to establish precisely what Mr Vithlani did with the money that was paid to him,\u201d Mr Justice Bean said. \u201cBut on the basis of the documents shown to me it seems na\u00efve in the extreme to think that Mr Vithlani was simply a well-paid lobbyist.\u201d He added that BAE Systems made payments with the intention that Vithlani would have \u201cfree rein to make such payments to such people as he thought fit\u201d adding that they \u201cdid not want to know the details\u201d.\u00a0\nThe UK had been a major player in negotiating the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on arms exports which said, in addition to normal provisions limiting arms sales, that all EU countries would block arms exports that would seriously hamper the sustainable development of countries. Despite this I couldn't get support from Number 10, the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence or Departments of Trade and Industry to use the government licensing system to block the contract. I said at the time if BAE Systems and all those government departments would go to such lengths to support such an indefensible but relatively small defence export, it made one fearful of what they would do for bigger things.\nSadly, arms sales to Saudi Arabia are an example of bigger things. There is a long history of corrupt behaviour sanctioned by successive governments. As recently as 2006, the UK terminated a major foreign bribery investigationconcerning the Al-Yamamah arms deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia, for which BAE Systems was the main contractor.\nAt the time, the Serious Fraud Office was investigating an alleged \u00a320 million slush fund designed to bribe Saudi officials. In autumn 2006, the SFO planned to look at certain bank accounts in Switzerland -- with the cooperation of the Swiss authorities -- to find out whether payments had been made to a Saudi agent or public official, according to a 2008 House of Lords judgement. This provoked an \u201cexplicit threat\u201d by the Saudi authorities, the judgement noted, that if the investigation continued \u201cSaudi Arabia would withdraw from the existing bilateral counter-terrorism co-operation arrangements with the UK, withdraw cooperation from the UK in relation to its strategic objectives in the Middle East and end the negotiations then in train for the procurement of Typhoon aircraft.\u201d\nAfter consultations with then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Attorney General, the director of the Serious Fraud Office Robert Wardle halted the investigation. He said that continuing would risk \u201cserious harm\u201d to the UK\u2019s national and international security. The SFO announced the end of the investigation in a press release, quoted in the judgement: \u201cIt has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider public interest. No weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest.\u201d Tony Blair said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the decision.\nIn 2010, to settle allegations of bribery made about the Al Yamamah deal, the arms giant pleaded guilty to charges of false accounting in a U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia. BAE Systems was sentenced to pay $400 million (\u00a3277 million) in what then-Attorney General Gary Grindler called \u201cone of the largest criminal fines ever levied in the United States against a company for business related violations.\u201d\nThe story of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia is so murky, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of just how bad it was, and that it continued from the late \u201860s until 2006, implicating every successive government.\nAccording to a briefing by The Guardian newspaper on BAE in Saudi Arabia \u2013 part of a lengthy, groundbreaking investigation \u2013 the US warned at the outset, \u201cSaudi requests for arms were not based on considerations of national security as much as private pressure by those most likely to profit from arms sales\u2026\u201d. But successive governments took no notice.\nThe first deal was made in 1967 under Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government. It was, according to the Guardian report, for 42 Lightning fighters plus a radar contract. The value was \u00a3104 million (today\u2019s value, \u00a31.7 billion). The commission paid by BAE was at least \u00a37.8 million (\u00a3128 million in today\u2019s values). These payments were authorised by government officials and were declared to three UK agencies. The Inland Revenue, in documents obtained by the Guardian, minuted privately that the \u201chard fact is that bribery is essential\u201d.\nThe UK government became more involved with the next deal in 1973. Worth \u00a3253 million (modern equivalent \u00a32.8 billion), according to Guardian research, it was for Strikemaster fighter jets, training and maintenance for the Saudi\u2019s existing Lightnings. \u00a0Made under Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government, the commission payment was over \u00a330 million (\u00a3327 million today). This was the first time the UK government became directly involved in payments after the Saudis demanded a \u2018government to government\u2019 deal.\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence signed a contract with Saudi Arabia, and took the money from Riyadh. It then employed BAE as lead supplier with an officially controlled profit margin. But in fact the official \u2018profit margin\u2019 was a fiction,\u201d theGuardian briefing said. \u201cThe prices were inflated and millions of pounds in \u2019commission\u2019 were channeled by BAE into anonymous Swiss bank accounts\u2026The government auditor concluded that the government was up to its neck in bribery.\u201d\nIn taking the trouble to remind my readers of this sad history, I am not suggesting that the UK behaved any worse than other OECD countries. There are similar scandals in many comparable countries. What is important is that we face up to the fact that a massive responsibility for very large-scale bribery and corruption originates in countries like our own. We must also recognise that action to challenge such behaviour has been taken only very recently and is not properly enforced in most countries.\nIn December 2014 the OECD published an analysis of the cost of foreign bribery and corruption. The report analysed more than 400 cases worldwide involving companies or individuals from the 41 signatory countries to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, which were involved in bribing foreign public officials. The cases took place between February 1999, when the Convention came into force, and June 2014. Almost two thirds of cases occurred in just four sectors: extraction (19%); construction (15%); transportation and storage and information and communications (10%). Bribes were promised, offered or given most frequently to employees of state-owned enterprises (27%) followed by customs officials (11%), health officials (7%) and defence officials (6%). Heads of state and ministers were bribed in 5% of cases but received 11% of total bribes. In most cases bribes were paid to obtain public procurement contracts (57%), followed by clearance of customs procedures (12%). 6% of bribes were given to gain preferential tax treatment. In 41% of cases management-level employees paid or authorised the bribe.\nIf I may, I will digress for a moment. I would like to recall the advice I was given in 1977 when I left the Home Office and went to work as the director of a community organisation based in Handsworth in Birmingham. When I met with our auditor to discuss the financial systems and bookkeeping, I suggested we might keep a few pounds in a tin as petty cash to pay for milk and tea and other small items. He emphasised strongly something I have never forgotten, that I owed it to everyone who worked in the organisation to set up a system that could not be fiddled. It was impossible to know what pressures and temptations individuals might be subjected to. If systems were tight, no one could be tempted and it would be better for everyone. TI make this point clearly on its website: \u201cpeople are as corrupt as the system allows them to be\u201d.\nWhen it comes to developing countries it is often the case that governments have over the years offered jobs in the public sector to more people than they can really afford. Over time, wages tend to decline to such a level that people cannot live on the income that they take home. We find that in such cases policemen start taking small payments from members of the public and minor officials make similar charges. The question each of us should ask ourselves is, if we were unable to feed our children with the salary we were paid, and such practices were widespread, should we be joining in? Such examples show\u00a0\nthat petty corruption is usually a result of bad systems rather than morally defective people. The challenge for development is to help countries out of such a trap. There have been various programmes for public-sector reform in order to offer redundancy to older workers, slim down the size of the public service and provide better wages for those that remain. They tend not to be favoured by the commentariat.\nThus we must be clear that working for development, anti-corruption and good governance is not a question of hectoring from the moral high ground or denunciation and threats of the withdrawal of aid, but of helping to build systems that prevent such corruption. This is an important purpose of budgetary aid, so disliked by so many, where development funds are put into government budgets on condition of joint work to build well-organised public financial management and procurement systems. The prize from such work is that people in poor countries with weak institutions see aid well spent, help provided to build up the capacity of government systems, and their own tax revenues better protected and better spent.\nIn recent years, we have also engaged in Security Sector Reform, helping countries to organise their military, police and intelligence agencies effectively to deal with the real challenges they face, and to try to clean up defence procurement, which, as we have seen, has been a murky area for very many years.\nThe poorest and most fragile countries are often engaged in conflict or newly emerged from conflict, and they pose a real challenge for development.\nThe laudable aim of the government to work more in fragile states will impose greater risks that aid money may go astray. The task here is to help countries to build reliable government systems and this takes years of effort. Our experience in Afghanistan, and the terrible corruption that there is after more than 10 years of massive international aid, shows that we have many lessons to learn to get this right.\nThe 2014 OECD study of prosecutions for breaches of the Anti Bribery Convention found that Extractives was the biggest bribery sector. For the past five years (until February 2016) I have chaired the international Board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) which was established over 10 years ago to try to use transparency to improve accountability in this traditionally highly opaque and corrupt sector. A short description of this work helps to exemplify the challenge in working to reduce corruption in a major problematic sector.\nAgain, in this field, it is only in the last 10 years that concern has been expressed about resource wealth feeding corruption and conflict, and the failure of vast oil and mineral resources to lead to sustainable development and the reduction of poverty. In the Cold War years, western governments\u2019 major concern was security of supply, and companies shared that concern together with an anxiety to secure their profits and avoid nationalisation. The World Bank, and other banks and investment institutions, cared only about the return on investment and not about the wider governance and social consequences of their investments in this sector.\nResearch evidence has been available since the founding of OPEC in the 1970s that, paradoxically, the discovery of oil and other natural resources, tended to undermine and not improve poverty reduction and economic development. For a long time explanation focused on currency appreciation and fluctuations in revenues. But as early as 1975 the Venezuelan oil minister, who was a co-founder of OPEC said, \u201cI call petroleum the Devil\u2019s excrement, it brings trouble... waste, corruption.... public services falling apart. And debt, debt we shall have for many years\u201d. It was, again, only from the mid \u201890s onwards that the perverse outcome of oil extraction in developing countries came into the spotlight. This was because research identified bad governance as driver behind very dismal development in resource rich countries. The\u00a0\nresearch suggested that oil and mineral-rich states in the developing world were more likely to suffer from lack of provision of basic public goods, corruption, and civil war than comparable non-resource-rich countries, and also more likely to be poorer. These findings were generally referred to as \u201cthe resource curse\u201d and this is a widespread reality. But countries like Norway and the UK in the case of oil, and Canada and Australia in mining, are not so cursed. It is clear that the problem is governance, not the nature of the resources themselves, although it is true that fluctuating prices, resource-depletion and the likelihood of currency appreciation do pose particular difficulties.\nIt is clear also that poor development outcomes were caused by the link between international and domestic factors, i.e. the interaction between multinational companies and their shareholders and investors, host governments and greedy elites. The work of TI and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery were important influences on public debate as were Global Witness reports on egregious corruption in Angola. Global opinion turned against major companies, particularly oil companies, and denounced their behaviour. The old slogan that \u201cthe business of business is business\u201d was no longer acceptable.\nThe Publish What You Pay coalition was formed initially from NGOs in the UK which has since spread to a worldwide movement. The idea behind the EITI is clear and simple: build a coalition of companies, governments and civil society at the international and national level, and require companies to report what they paid to governments and governments what they receive, and publish the figures so that the public can hold governments to account. It took a little time to recruit a board with representatives of each sector, to establish a secretariat, to draw up rules and procedures and a multi-donor trust fund in the World Bank to provide technical support. From 2006 on, the organisation grew quickly. There are now 51 countries implementing the EITI. Half are in Africa but it now includes a wide range of countries ranging from Peru, Mongolia, Iraq, Trinidad and Tobago and Norway, the US and UK.\nThere is no doubt that the EITI got off to a good start. The number of countries that volunteered to sign up to the reporting requirements grew steadily, as did the supporting companies and members of the NGO network. It is interesting to reflect on why all these different entities decided to join. They came together but each sector had slightly different motivation. The countries tended to want a reputation as a reformer so they could attract inward investment, the companies to prove that they did make payments to governments and the NGOs to try to ensure that the money was spent to help the poor. There have been declarations of support from the G8, the G20 and the United Nations General Assembly amongst others.\nHowever a 2011 evaluation suggested that the simple pass/fail benchmark was inadequate as though reform was a simple matter of complying with basic EITI reporting rules and producing an EITI report. In addition academic commentators pointed out that a simple report of the amount of money paid by companies, and a reconciliation with government receipts, does not ensure that the original contract was fair, what was due to be paid was paid, that the money was properly spent, let alone that there are sensible plans to deal with price fluctuations and the economic consequences of exhaustion of resources.\nThis is the reason for the clause in the Dodd Franks legislation in the US, which plans to require listed companies to report their payments for oil, gas and mineral resources to governments in the developing world, country by country, project by project. The EU has introduced a similar Transparency Directive which is in the process of being implemented. We must conclude that a vague commitment to transparency is not enough to ensure good governance, and we cannot assume that multi-stakeholder groups on their own will have the capacity to build adequate systems of political accountability.\nThis is the reason also why EITI introduced more testing reporting requirements supported by all parts of the coalition at its conference in 2013 in Sydney. The new reporting standard requires transparency across the value chain including licensing system, state-owned enterprises and production levels. It also encourages openness on contracts and as full as possible reporting on beneficial ownership. There is a new requirement to provide an account of the overall context so that any concerned citizen could read the report and understand the importance of the sector and challenge of managing it to the benefit of future of their country. In addition, there is a new stress on making government systems more transparent and robust, rather than requiring more and more elaborate EITI reports. The aim of the EITI must surely be to encourage member countries to put in place transparent and robust government systems and to develop a more informed public debate in each country. Progress is being made but building strong and robust government systems and informed public debate takes time.\nMulti-stakeholder governance is not for the fainthearted. Bringing together governments, companies and civil society in countries where they have rarely sat down together, can in very important ways help to build trust, dispel myths and focus on the real reforms needed to improve governance in the extractives sector. But on the International Board which has the same composition, campaigning northern NGOs tend to believe that the EITI should be used to discipline countries with imperfect systems, whereas those with development experience understand that reform takes place when local reformers want it and see the potential benefits.\nThis argument reflects that between those who see development assistance as a means to help countries build better systems and those want to withdraw aid to punish bad governance. No doubt these arguments will continue for a considerable time.\nIn addition to the challenges posed by the OECD Convention on Bribery, and initiatives such as EITI that work to help countries with very weak institutions build governance systems that prevent corruption, the issue of Illicit Financial Flows has recently pushed itself to the forefront of the international agenda.\nThis has been triggered partly by an increased focus on the prevention of money-laundering to fund terrorist organisations and also by public anger over tax evasion. In recent years the G8 and the G20 have urged countries to strengthen their anti-money laundering regimes, enforce greater transparency on company ownership and to exchange information in order to tackle tax evasion. It remains the case that every year, huge sums of money are transferred out of developing countries illegally. While such practices occur in all countries \u2013 and are damaging everywhere \u2013 they are probably larger in scale in developing countries because the institutions are weaker. And the impact in poor countries is worse because there are less resources available for investment and to fund public services. Estimates of the scale of this problem vary greatly but the OECD concludes that \"there is a general consensus that illicit financial flows likely exceed aid flows and investment in volume\u201d.\nAccording to the 2014 OECD report \"Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: Measuring OECD Responses\u201d, illicit flows involve money laundering, bribery by international companies, tax evasion and trade mispricing. In practice such flows range from private individuals transferring funds into private funds abroad without paying taxes, to highly complex schemes involving criminal networks. Most of the public attention has focused on the behaviour of kleptocrats such as president Abacha of Nigeria, or president Marcos of the Philippines. They and others like them looted their countries and after death were found to have large fortunes invested overseas in a wide variety of assets. Deeply guilty as these rulers were, part of the guilt lies with western institutions; the problem would not reach such massive proportions if it were not possible to move such ill-gotten gains out of the originating country.\nIn 2011 at an important meeting in Busan aimed at improving Aid Effectiveness, agreement was reached to \"accelerate\u2026 efforts to combat illicit financial flows by strengthening anti money-laundering measures, addressing tax evasion and strengthening national and international policies, legal frameworks and institutional arrangements for the tracing, freezing and recovery of illegal assets\". The G20 and G8 have taken forward this agenda. The most recent summit of the G8 hosted by the UK government at Lough Erne stressed the need to improve the exchange of tax information and knowledge of the real persons owning companies. To achieve these aims will involve a massive effort to help countries strengthen their tax systems in the countries in which the wealth is earned. This agenda also requires a cleanup of tax havens which is a particular responsibility for the UK with its large number of tax havens in its overseas territories.\nAnother example of how recently the international system has moved to tackle corruption is the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) which was adopted by the General Assembly in 2003 and has been adopted by 174 member states.\nIt is the first global legally binding international anti-corruption instrument. It is extremely ambitious. In its 71 Articles divided into 8 Chapters, UNCAC requires that countries implement anticorruption measures aimed at preventing corruption, including domestic and foreign bribery, embezzlement, trading in influence and money laundering. The Treaty is also intended to strengthen international law enforcement and judicial cooperation, provide effective legal mechanisms for asset recovery, technical assistance and information exchange, and mechanisms for implementation. TI, which has played a\u00a0\nsignificant part in the negotiation of the Convention, said in its 2013 Progress Report on the reviews provided for under the Implementation Mechanism,\n\u201cIt is important to recognise that the Implementation Review Mechanism must deal with daunting challenges that are orders of magnitudes greater than those of other anti-corruption treaties. These result from the UNCAC\u2019s extremely comprehensive scope and its worldwide membership of countries with large differences in political and legal systems. What has been accomplished in three years is impressive, but the process is still evolving\u201d.\nThe international efforts to reduce corruption that have developed over the past 20 years constitute a massive agenda which is being worked through in multilateral institutions, individual countries, companies and civil society campaigns. It will take years of reform to fulfil the commitments that have been made. But the prize is enormous.\nIf all these commitments are fully implemented,16 of the poorest countries in the world would retain their own wealth: their losses are estimated by the sober OECD as being worth as much as the total of international aid and inward investment to these countries. The result would be that institutions and government systems across the world would be cleaned up and we would have a safe, more equally developed world with more people having a fair chance in life. Corruption everywhere would be reduced because there would be fewer opportunities and great difficulties for the corrupt to move their money to safe hiding places. Tax evasion by companies and individuals would be massively reduced, so the public services will be more fairly funded across the world. This would surely be a morally preferable and safer world for all of us.", "I am a nurse. I care.\nI protect, advocate, listen, empathise, teach, lead and inspire. I save lives. I help others.

Donald Trump\u2019s crucial meetings with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill \u2013 most importantly the House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 were variously hailed by the participants as \u201cvery encouraging,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d and \u201cplanting the seeds of unity.\u201d What political party goes into an election openly acknowledging disunity?\nBut it was no less clear \nAnd, if words have meaning, he still isn\u2019t quite there.

He also wants to preserve his party\u2019s majority in the House \u2013 which might end up its sole bulwark in Washington if Mr Trump is defeated and costs the Republicans control of the Senate.\nAs for Mr Trump, it may the year of the outsider, of a voters\u2019 backlash against a discredited Washington establishment. \u201cI have a mandate,\u201d he correctly proclaims.\u00a0\nBut even someone who\u2019s brought millions of new voters into the Republican fold during the primaries can\u2019t lightly forego the support of the man who ex officio is still scheduled to wield the gavel at the Cleveland convention.\nA formal split in the Republican party \u2013 that would seal its fate in November \u00a0- is unlikely. But if it happens it will be because conservative purists break away. Mr Ryan is a certified conservative, and his explicit support will help \u00a0persuade ideological Republicans to hold their noses and back a candidate who they believe has hardly a conservative bone in his body.\nBut rapprochement won't happen overnight, or \u201cin 45 minutes\u201d as Mr Ryan put it later. Rather, it\u2019s a process that will continue at further meetings over the next few weeks, that get down into policy specifics. The outcome, though, is hardly in doubt. The Republicans will have their \u201cunity.\u201d Sometimes even a figleaf will do.", "There are four big names in the EU referendum campaign, two on each side, which as any KS2 mathematician could tell you means six possible different head-to-head combinations, four of which pit an Inner against an Outer.\u00a0\nSo far, the only pairing that has been confirmed is David Cameron versus Nigel Farage on ITV on 7 June, and that is not actually a face-to-face confrontation: Cameron will go first, followed by Farage.* Several other events, including the BBC\u2019s at Wembley Arena on 21 June, two days before the referendum, have yet to confirm speakers.\u00a0\nHere is what might happen in the four possible two-way debates.\n*David Cameron and Michael Gove are booked to appear on Sky on consecutive days, 2 June and 3 June. Gove vies with Farage for second place on the Leave side, but Cameron is reluctant to debate fellow Conservatives.", "How do you write about living with an illness for almost 30 years without sounding like you\u2019re whining? It\u2019s a tricky job, and despite three decades of experience with it I\u2019m still not confident in speaking of my medical condition. I much prefer to bat away the issue of my health and use smoke and mirrors to mask my reality.\nIn the late 1980s, when I was aged just eight, I was given the diagnosis of ME \u2013 Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. After years of (literally) painstaking tests, the doctors informed my mother with the comment, \u201cThere, happy now?\u201d \u00a0\nA simple diagnosis was considered a victory, but even at such a young age I knew I was lumbered with one of the \u2018rubbish diseases\u2019.\nIn 30 years, during which I have completed my education and launched a career, there\u2019s been little in the way of change in my treatment for this severe condition \u2013 even less in the manner in which we talk about ME.\nBecause we have little to no valuable information on the illness, primarily due to a lack of funding for research, sufferers like me are stiff treated as malingerers. It\u2019s positively Victorian in its stigmatisation.\nNone of us like to be reminded of what can go wrong with the human body, and few are willing to give credence to the notion that a devastating illness like ME can happy to any one of us \u2013 it\u2019s always someone else that tires themselves out.\nThat\u2019s misconception number one: the blue ribbon belief that ME is simply being \u2018a bit tired\u2019. I\u2019d describe it rather differently, as having your entire life-force sucked from your soul. It\u2019s as if a joyrider has taken over your body for a spin, only to burn it out and leave you on the side of the road. And the pain that comes with it is pretty much indescribable.\nThink I\u2019m getting a little whiney? There are some positives too.\nLiving with a severe illness, you develop a keen sense of perspective. When you become a spectator on the world, you begin to realise what\u2019s important and what is not. You simply can\u2019t afford to sweat the small stuff when you have a confined existence. When you\u2019re locked in a prison of your body\u2019s devising, fighting a perpetual battle beneath the skin, you soon let the insignificant pass on by.\nThere\u2019s a theory proposed by suffers of chronic conditions called Spoon Theory, which explains what it\u2019s like to have limited energy reservoirs to spend on living your everyday life. Each morning you start the day with a certain number of spoons in your hand (the number depends on how well you are that day). Every time you complete a task, a spoon is discarded \u2013 and when the spoons run out, that\u2019s the end of your day.\nPersonally, I prefer to use the term \u2018mudget\u2019 \u2013 my ME budget. We\u2019re all familiar with handling budgets, so it doesn\u2019t take much to grasp how one has to plan, save, distribute, and generally keep a close eye on precious resources.\nWant to invite me to your function? Well, I shall have to check my mudget and see if there\u2019s anything in the bank. Only please don\u2019t stop inviting me even though I may have to let you down at the last minute.\nI\u2019m often reminded of a Star Wars quote in times of social crisis: \u201cI\u2019m endangering the mission, I shouldn\u2019t have come\u201d. When you don\u2019t fit the common image of disability you often hear the comment, people often tell you \u201cyou look so well\u201d. It\u2019s a lovely sentiment but, if you want to use it, lose the note of accusation in your tone.\nAfter such a long time of dealing with a near house-bound condition, I\u2019ve learned not to look at the world with envy but instead with gratitude for the things I am able to achieve, and with a joy for those that are able to do as they wish.\nI believe we all have a responsibility to take hold of our lives and do with it as we choose. If you have your health \u2013 or some semblance of it \u2013 then you have more control over that choice. But even if, like me, your circumstances are conducive to full control of your own destiny (and, frankly, who can boast that?), then do all you can to milk life for everything it\u2019s worth.\nDon\u2019t dwell on insignificance, and say yes to everything you possibly can. Just remember to rest well while you\u2019re at it.", "As a bastion of gender equality, a champion of free expression and a monumental force for good in using his platform to celebrate women\u2019s achievements, I was surprised to see the results of Piers Morgan\u2019s latest project,\nI cannot deny that the tale is chilling. A softly spoken, articulate 16-year-old girl with the looks of an angel and a sweet singing voice plots to kill her entire family. Her boyfriend and his best friend, aided by her encouragement, storm into her Texas home in 2008 wielding guns and swords, brutally murdering her mother and two brothers, while she waits outside in the car with an accomplice\u2019s girlfriend. Her father survives and the two rebuild their relationship while she spends the next decade behind bars.\nA juicy story with plenty of meat for a former tabloid editor \u2013 but hopefully also an opportunity to challenge the audience on the meaning of bad and good, a chance to study the human psyche, to find out more than we could already read in the \nBut after an hour-long interview with 24-year-old Erin Caffey and conversations with her family, neighbours and psychologists, what did we get?\n\u201cShe is the most evil woman I have ever met,\u201d says Piers.\nOh. Does that mean we can forget watching\nA shame, really, that such a fascinating and frightening story was hijacked by a man who appears to see the world in black\u00a0and\u00a0white and takes every opportunity to further his career by creating controversy.\nOf course Piers Morgan focuses on the sex Erin Caffey had with her boyfriend in his trailer after the murders, and of course he pushed her as to whether she felt guilty for what she had \"made\"\u00a0another family's son do, instead of focusing on the role the knife-wielding son played himself.\u00a0It\u2019s the wicked, beautiful witch syndrome:\u00a0the face of an angel, wearing lipstick and\u00a0eye shadow, dressed all in white, singing \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 behind bars.\nAfter his constant stream of negative and simplistic commentary on cultural affairs \u2013\u00a0 disparaging Susan Sarandon\u2019s clothes, disregarding journalist Michelle Fields\u2019 right to accuse Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager (who denies it)\u00a0of battery, criticising Beyonc\u00e9 for using her new album as a platform to fight racism \u2013 it would be truly refreshing if Mr Morgan deigned to say something,\u00a0anything,\u00a0positive about women.\nYes, women do bad things. Awful things. Crazy things. Evil things. They should face punishment;\u00a0the same punishment as men.\u00a0But women, especially when talking about such disturbing and high profile crimes, will inevitably soak up more of the blame and the media attention as it is rarer for a woman to be involved in the first place.\nAnother predictable point: there was little mention of the two teenage boys who actually murdered the family. Let\u2019s not forget that whatever despicable things Erin Caffey did, it was not her who took turns to stab eight-year-old Tyler Caffey as he hid in the closet, or almost behead mother Penny Caffey with a samurai sword.\nSo:\u00a0Erin is evil. Is that it?\nGive us a break, Piers. It won\u2019t say \u201c5m Twitter followers\u201d on your tombstone. For someone who is so opinionated and shouts so much, you say surprisingly little of value. It\u2019s high time to put your massive public platform to better use.", "Dear Mr Smith,\nYou don\u2019t know me, but I feel as though we are really close.\u00a0 For the past 20 days I have worn your shirt.\u00a0At least, the shirt that was yours while you served in the American army.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the thing: I am sitting in an Israeli military prison.\u00a0And our uniforms, here in the military prison, were donated to my country by your country.\u00a0 Yes, it is really US Army uniforms that we are wearing, the tiger-skinned uniforms, the uniforms of the Marines, and some of them still have the family names of the soldiers sewn on the right and left sides of the shirts.\u00a0 And this time, I received your shirt with your nametag still sewn on the right side of the shirt.\nI want to tell you why I am in prison.\u00a0 I am sitting in prison because I refused to enlist in the Israeli army, because I am against the continuation of the policies of occupation in the occupied territories.\u00a0 I requested to do alternative community service, but they are not letting me do that.\u00a0 This time, when the prison uniform had a name on it, I thought of you.\u00a0 I wondered what you would think, how you would feel about me wearing your uniform.\nI wonder who you are.\u00a0 As one might expect, at the beginning I imagined you as a typical American, maybe chubby, a football fan, and maybe you have no idea what is happening here.\u00a0 You are, perhaps, not aware that there is a very complex and sad conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\u00a0 That actually, since the foundation of this country there have been horrible wars.\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s important for me to tell you, because I am wearing your shirt.\u00a0 We have been in this situation for many years now.\u00a0 A terrible situation where wars that keep on replaying themselves, over and over.\u00a0 Thousands of people on each side have been killed as a result of this war.\u00a0 The Palestinians live under Israeli occupation.\u00a0 The significance of this is that they are refused the basic rights of life, liberty, security and dignity.\u00a0\nThe Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip live under a heavy Israeli military presence, and about twice a year, the Israeli army also goes in and destroys the place.\u00a0 And of course the Israelis are suffering from this situation as well.\u00a0 We have a cycle of mourning that grows from year to year.\u00a0 For years now, entire communities in Israel, near the city of Shderot next to Gaza, have lived with the reality of constantly running to the bomb shelters to avoid incoming missiles - not just during war times, but daily.\u00a0 Huge populations of both soldiers and civilians live with trauma and anxiety.\nIf I can summarise, it is not safe here.\u00a0 For anyone.\u00a0 And the reason that this is connected to you is that your government is very involved.\u00a0 The taxes you pay support these wars, meaning we receive a \u201csecurity\u201d budget, and in Israel, the meaning of \u201csecurity\u201d is really \u201coccupation\u201d, a siege and closure of the Palestinian population.\u00a0For the security of Israelis, of course.\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t get your shirt randomly; your country is a little more involved in the situation than simply donating old uniforms. So now that you know the situation, are you bothered by the fact that your clothes and your money are actually playing a part in occupying the Palestinian people? Do you sleep well at night knowing this?\nActually, I imagine you a bit differently.\u00a0 I want to believe that you are a person who is active in your society, simply because it would be nice if the person whose shirt I wore was a significant person in his society. And that you are very aware of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u00a0You even are sometimes critical of Israel.\u00a0And you also know that you are not anti-Semitic just because you are against the occupation and support non-violent action against it, because Israel is committing crimes and it is important for you as a world citizen not to lend your hand to this. You are concerned about how your money is being used, and that\u2019s fantastic.\nBut I wonder if you make the connection, on a higher level, between what is happening in your city or state and what is happening across the sea where we live.\u00a0 Because we too, here in the Middle East, are hugely influenced by the policies there in the US.\u00a0\nI\u2019ll explain.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important to blame Israel for this whole problem.\u00a0 But that\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 You see, the atmosphere in Israel lately has become more and more violent, racist, and extremist, and our government is responsible for this; but your government continues to caress my government\u2019s head.\u00a0\nYes, I know that sometimes there is tension and I know that sometimes Bibi does stupid things in his relationship with you, but at the end of the day, you are giving the atrocities here protection:\u00a0 unofficial permission, but still very significant.\u00a0 So please, enough.\u00a0 Enough to the cooperation, enough to channeling money to support the occupation, enough to sending war equipment, enough to the hypocritical involvement that maintains the status quo.\nI am asking you, as the one who is wearing your old shirt, that you apply a little pressure there in the US and don\u2019t just give your government the legitimisation to support the crimes that are happening here.\nIt\u2019s suddenly hit me that it\u2019s possible you have actually died.\u00a0 I mean, you are also a soldier, you also served in a violent campaign, and maybe the power struggles killed you too. Maybe you lost your life as well.\u00a0 Maybe you had a family and children who became orphans because of some pig that wanted money. He didn\u2019t think at all about your mother, who lost her child, while he bought a new car.\u00a0He didn\u2019t think about your sister who lost her big brother while he bought off the decision-makers so he could continue to get richer.\u00a0I am sure he also didn\u2019t think about your best friend; he probably just went quietly off to sleep.\nI\u2019m sorry, Smith, I didn\u2019t think about that - and now I feel a little bad.\u00a0 You are just like the many Palestinians, the many Israelis: a victim.\u00a0 A victim of governments supporting wars and perpetuating injustice.\nSo Smith, I am sitting here in prison for you as well, because I am not willing to take part in the injustice that killed you and is killing many others.\u00a0Thankyou for accompanying me on this struggle for a better world that I believe is possible \u2013 it\u2019s possible for your children, and it\u2019s possible for mine.\nTair Kaminer", "Both The Republicans and Labour are in the throes of identity crises. Here\u2019s what Labour can learn from the failures of the American right.\nAfter eight years of a Democratic presidency in the US, The Republican Party should be benefitting from electorate weariness with the incumbent, Barack Obama. Instead, Obama\u2019s approval ratings have been improving, \nLabour faces a similar problem. The Tories are in the midst of a very public internal feud over the EU, and they have faced a series embarrassing U-turns \u2013 on tax credits, disability benefits, the Trade Union Bill, child refugee policy and others \u2013 demonstrating a clear misperception of majority public opinion, not to mention David Cameron\u2019s involvement in the Panama Papers scandal. Yet Labour has struggled to make meaningful ground, \nOn both sides of the Atlantic, there is an ongoing struggle to define the identity of each party. Both have faced insurgencies from their puritanical extremes, in the form of the likes of Ted Cruz and the Tea Party for The Republicans, and to a less extreme extent with the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader for Labour. These insurgencies have sought to depose party establishments that were seen as unprincipled and treacherous. In both instances, the diagnosis of their parties\u2019 electoral failures has been that they have been too compromising.\nHowever, for those in Labour that take this view, they should ask themselves whether the reason that The Republicans have been out of office for so long is because they have not been right wing enough \u2013 the diagnosis of the Cruz caucus. I suspect the answer would be an obvious no. This should put into sharp relief Labour\u2019s internal delusions about its own failures.\nThe Conservatives, as is plainly evident in the EU referendum campaign, have just as wide a range of views and just as many internal disagreements as Labour. The difference is that the Conservatives accept disagreement, but choose to emphasise their common ground first and foremost. This is not the only lesson to be learned.\nLabour should not be picky about where it finds its solutions. \nBut Labour must remember that no political party is built on a pure consensus; they are coalitions of only broad agreement. To win elections and serve the people that the party most wants to help requires more allies than adversaries, and seeking a more or less absolute concurrence of ideas, ideals and beliefs is a mistaken fantasy.\nSadiq Khan\u2019s call following his election as Mayor of London for Labour to speak to everyone, Conservative voters included, shows the practicality that is needed. The same is evident in France, with the socialist economy minister Emmanuel Macron\u2019s new political movement, \u201cEn Marche!\u201d (Forward!), which calls for a coalition beyond current party political distinctions.\nEvidently over the past few months no amount of Conservative self-destruction will automatically get Labour elected. Labour should rethink its alliances, and stop making traitors of political friends. That goes for both Corbynistas and Blairites.\nAnother of Barbour\u2019s maxims rings true: \u201cPurity is the enemy of victory\u201d. Does it matter that a right-winger said it? It shouldn\u2019t.", "It\u2019s been a very long time since the celebration of a Labour victory has brought with it such a sense of hope and encouragement for the future. Sadiq Khan was sworn in as Mayor of London in Southwark Cathedral surrounded by people of all faiths and of none. It was a joy to behold.\nThe absence of Jeremy Corbyn was telling. Sadiq has rightly said he doesn\u2019t want City Hall to become an alternative power base within the Labour Party. But the Khan campaign showed how Labour can win when it unites behind a clear vision, practical policies, and inclusive politics.\nThree crucial things the national leadership has demonstrably failed to deliver. \u00a0\u00a0\nNobody can accuse Sadiq Khan of being a closet Tory. His victory was all the sweeter because it helped expose and defeat the ugly side of modern Conservatism. The Zac Goldsmith campaign attempted shamelessly to divide communities from one another, play politics with the security of the capital and plant in people\u2019s minds the ridiculous notion that being a Muslim equates with being an \u2018extremist\u2019. David Siesage, who worked for Zac, exposed these deliberate tactics brilliantly in The Independent.\nYes, Sadiq Khan is Muslim. He is devout and he\u2019s proud of that fact. He never hid it. Just as I am Hindu and I, too, am very proud of my faith, my culture and my community. Sadiq, like me and millions of children of immigrants, loves the UK and the great world city that is London.\u00a0\nI am proud to call Sadiq Khan a friend. And yet while working to support him I saw a side of the Labour Party, too, that is the exact opposite of the kind of politics he represents.\nUnfortunately the Conservatives are not the only party to have given the impression of wanting to divide us into communities and favour one group over the other. \u00a0Somewhat belatedly, Jeremy Corbyn has admitted Labour isn\u2019t doing enough to win the next General Election. One essential first step is to recognise that the party has been inflicting huge damage on itself by alienating large parts of not just the Jewish community but Hindus and Sikhs as well.\u00a0\nLike Sadiq, I was brought up in an inner city council house, in my case in Birmingham. I\u2019ve been Labour all my life, despite huge pressure from many within the British Indian community to follow them in abandoning my party and embracing the Tories instead.\nAt the last general election, for the first time in history, more Indians voted Conservative than Labour. Ten years ago we had a lead of around 30%.\u00a0\nThere are more young people of Indian descent coming up through the ranks of the Tory Party, as office holders and councilors. Younger generation Indians are feeling more and more alienated and sidelined by our party. At its most stark, the perception has become embedded that Labour is for the Pakistanis and Muslims while the Tories are for Indians and Hindus.\nHere is the hard and uncomfortable truth. Too many people in the Labour Party stereotype us in exactly the same way the Tories do. It saddens me to remember how many times I have heard Labour people say, \u201cwell Indians are getting richer so of course they will vote Tory\u201d.\u00a0\nWhat a shallow, defeatist mentality.\nVery few Indians live in two million pound mansions. I certainly don\u2019t. It may be true that we don\u2019t regard the pursuit of wealth as something evil, and nor do we treat those who have become successful with animosity. But is Labour really saying we don\u2019t want to represent those with high hopes and aspirations for themselves and their families? If the answer is \u2018yes\u2019 then we may as well kiss goodbye to the next general election now.\u00a0\nWe can and must fight these false perceptions. I know they don\u2019t truly reflect the party I have worked so hard for all my political life.\u00a0\nSadiq Kahn is already showing us the way. One of his last campaign visits was to a Hindu Temple in north London. Pictures of him taking part in its rituals went viral on the internet. His grandparents were Indian and he\u2019s proud of the fact. He says he looks forward to engaging directly with the government in New Delhi and leading a trade delegation to India as soon as possible. Contrast that with the failure of Jeremy Corbyn even to show up when Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to members of both houses in Westminster at the end of last year.\nI was honoured when Sadiq asked me to join his campaign for the party\u2019s mayoral nomination as a senior advisor. What happened next was deeply troubling. Supporters of Mr Corbyn took to social media to warn that my appointment would upset Muslims (the language used was much coarser) and might damage Sadiq. My \u2018crime\u2019, in the eyes of some of them, was to have worked hard to make Mr Modi\u2019s visit to the UK a success. \u00a0\u00a0\nHere was a fantastic opportunity for the party to demonstrate unity of purpose between different communities. And yet members of the radical left tried to use my involvement to do exactly the opposite and, in the process, to warn Sadiq off fighting a more centrist campaign.\nSuch divisive, hate-filled politics will destroy our party if we don\u2019t exclude it completely and utterly from our ranks. That is what we mean when we say Jeremy Corbyn hasn\u2019t acted quickly or decisively enough. The Zac Goldsmith campaign in London was rightly condemned, even by decent Tories, for its racial stereotyping and a conscious attempt to spread division and mistrust for political ends. There is an element within our own party that is intent on doing exactly the same thing.\nSo this is not special pleading on behalf of Indians, Hindus or anybody else. Labour can and will succeed when it can show that at all levels it respects and values our diversity as a nation. Most Labour people do. Only a small minority are letting the rest of us down.\u00a0\nLabour must root out the genuine extremists and condemn their allies among the left. That alone will not be enough. At all levels the party must stop thinking it has to put communities on a see-saw \u2013 constantly seeking to balance one group\u2019s interests against the other. As Sadiq Khan said, \u201cwe will never be trusted to govern unless we reach out and engage with all voters \u2013 regardless of their background, where they live or where they work.\u201d\u00a0\nThose are wise words from a man who stood up bravely against the Corbynistas and showed that inclusive politics is not only good politics \u2013 it is winning politics.", "What shall we write on the gravestone of this passing era of social democracy? \u2018Here was a society in which housing was a social good. Here was a society in which healthcare was the fundamental right of every citizen. Here was a society in which being unemployed did not mean having to be destitute.\u2019 We call these things social housing, the NHS and benefits.\nI grew up in the 1980s, at the fag end of this beautiful ideal. But I was still able to use libraries \u2013 a building housing the knowledge of humanity available to everyone, and a beautiful idea. Here was a society which wanted to nurture its citizens.\u00a0Now the concept of a library is going the way of the penny farthing. Hundreds have closed since 2010. It is nothing less than the destruction of the municipal, of a civic ethos of disinterested public service.\nWe have a government\u00a0which wants to close children's centres, dismantle the NHS and destroy the welfare state. In other words, much that is great about post-war British social democracy.\u00a0\nCan we really have sunk so far that we are prepared to abandon all this without a fight? I don\u2019t think so. So here are the five tactics the government are using. Now you can spot them, and challenge them where you find it.\nNeoliberalism, the orthodoxy of unregulated free markets, often relies on the use of a shock to implement otherwise unpalatable policies.\nThe flawed austerity agenda has turned a private sector banking crisis into a public spending crisis. The banks, bailed out by the taxpayer, have since made record profits and dished out eye-watering bonuses. Meanwhile, the rest of society has been forced to pick up the tab in the form of the largest post-war public spending cuts.\nThis is straight out of the Donald Trump playbook, the classic recipe of the elite when confronted with capitalism in crisis: find a scapegoat.\nThe average Briton thinks that 27 per cent of the welfare budget is lost to benefit fraud. The real figure is just 0.7 per cent, according to government statistics. Though various studies show that migrants pay in more to the welfare states than they take out in benefits \u2013 that\u2019s not the message that we\u2019re hearing through the popular press.\nAs a result, we are now seeing the rise of the far right and a resurgence of nationalism in the US and across Europe. History tells us that this does not tend to end well.\nThe majority of welfare recipients (excluding pensioners) are actually in work.\u00a0Conservatives politicians bang on about making work pay, but the shocking reality is that more people below the poverty line are in work than unemployed or unable to work.\nUnemployment benefits account for less than 3 per cent of the benefits bill, and large chunks of what is spent elsewhere \u2013 on tax credits or housing benefit, for example \u2013 effectively subsidise employers and private landlords.\nAdd to this corporate welfare in the form of various tax breaks and reliefs, subsidies and grants, and it becomes clear that the richest also rely on a massive helping hand from the state.\nIt is worth remembering that the welfare state and the NHS were created after world war two, when Britain had much greater debts on its books.\nAt present, the UK is the fifth wealthiest country in the world. Chancellor George Osborne famously said that \u201cwe're all in this together\u201d, yet there is plenty of public money for the banks \u2013 up to $1.2trn, according to calculations by the New Economics Foundation.\nIn other words, austerity is not actually a necessity. It is driven by the doctrine that every sector of industry and society should be opened up to market forces, for profit.\nIf you really wanted to bring down the benefits bill then, you might want to legislate for a genuine living wage (not the lower rate the Government has introduced) in order to reduce tax credits. You might also want to build more social housing to reduce housing benefit payments.

The political blunderbuss that is Boris Johnson, with his Trumpian ability to make people pay attention to him no matter how loose his argument, would be an even greater risk.\nWe do not know the details of the conversations that were held between ITV, Downing Street, and the rival campaigns, nor how the current arrangement was reached.\nBut Downing Street demonstrated its ability to get its way by avoiding a one-on-one with Miliband last year \u2013 and went on to win the election. Did Vote Leave really think they would play a different game this time, when Mr Cameron is facing probably the biggest political fight of his career?\nIt\u00a0doesn\u2019t make it right, but it does make the Leave campaign\u2019s sudden burst of anger appear na\u00efve.\nThe response also risks becoming a story about civil war within the Leave campaign itself.\nNigel Farage, a man who for many years has been the most prominent voice for Britain to leave the EU and \u2013 whatever one thinks of him \u2013 has worked tire tirelessly to achieve his goal, will be feeling justifiably furious that the people in Vote Leave who should be his allies are willing to so publicly indicate that they think he\u2019s not up to the job of taking on David Cameron.\nThe row yet again exposes the key fault-line in the Brexit camp \u2013 between the \u2018soft\u2019 Leave campaign, that wants to argue about sovereignty and present a positive vision of a grand future for Britain looking beyond Europe to India, China and America for its trade partnerships; and the \u2018hard\u2019 Leave campaign, that wants to talk about immigration and dangers of the refugee crisis for Europe\u2019s security.\nBoris Johnson, Michael Gove et all need to accept that in backing Brexit they made an informal alliance with UKIP and the harder elements of the Leave campaign.

But regardless of the exact details, she is undoubtedly going through a terrible time. Her father, Colin, is gravely ill with cancer and lives four hours away, and she tweeted that she is simply \u201cnot strong enough\u201d to do the show. She has described her role in the musical as an \u201cemotional rollercoaster\u201d, claiming that it feels like \u201cdoing a marathon every night\u201d. She has also spoken of her struggles in the past; in an interview with the \nPublic reaction, especially on Twitter, has been incredibly obnoxious, with people calling her a \u201cloose cannon nutcase\u201d who should \u201cjust get over it\u201d because she\u2019s not \u201cstarving, homeless or disabled\u201d. The lack of sympathy for her situation is deeply saddening. The insulting, ableist language used to lambast her, along with the constant reiteration of the idea that Smith should have to be physically suffering in some way in order to be truly unable to cope, reflects damaging attitudes, especially concerning the people we idolise. We have always demanded a huge level of self-sacrifice from our performers, and we are quick to forget that the mask of whichever character they might be playing - or as it is known in the trade, \u201cDr Theatre\u201d - does not provide an automatic distraction from their own physical or mental suffering.\u00a0\nSmith\u2019s reaction to the online abuse was to retaliate against these \u201cvultures\u201d, tweeting: \u201cCome say your s*** to my face and see what happens\u201d. Another tweet read: \u201cI apologise profusely! Sorry, sorry, I\u2019m not strong enough\u201d. It\u2019s deeply upsetting to read that she feels the need to apologise, and that she\u2019s been forced to acknowledge her current emotional state as evidence of a personal fault, of an inherent weakness. But when both the media and her fans are constantly using this same language to shame her for her decision to temporarily take a step back in the name of self-preservation, it\u2019s hardly surprising.\u00a0\nThe reaction from the Savoy Theatre also reflects a disappointing lack of empathy. They tweeted on Tuesday that Smith would be replaced by Natasha J Barnes due to \u201cthe indisposition of Sheridan Smith.\u201d It was unsympathetic wording to say the least.\nSmith is undoubtedly a brilliant performer, having won a Bafta, two Oliviers and even an OBE at just 34 years of age, but in our obsession with idolising celebrity figures, we often forget that performers are people too. In a world where people aren\u2019t allowed to take time out because they can\u2019t cope (with whatever might be going on in their lives), how can we expect to see enlightened attitudes?

I spent ages choosing which company I would have my wedding list with and wasted hours poring over expensive products, getting a thrill of excitement every time I received an email telling me an item had been bought by one of my guests.\nBut when I heard about the gobsmacked Mumsnet user who had been told by an ungrateful couple that her \u00a3100 cash gift wasn\u2019t good enough, I was as shocked and indignant as anyone else. But more than that, I was also filled with a sense of guilt, sadness and regret.\nWhen my husband and I were thinking about where to have our wedding list, I didn\u2019t want to be restricted to just one high street retailer. This is why I created my list with WrapIt, an upmarket firm which let you create an online list from a whole plethora of luxury brands.\nAt the time, I had a weakness for designer homeware (my three children dictate that most things I choose now have to fulfil the criteria of being wipe-clean and unbreakable), and the idea of ending up with cupboards full of beautiful items to treasure was just too tempting to resist.\nWe created our list in a minimalist store in Birmingham where a saleswoman wowed me with glossy brochures and crockery samples. I wasn\u2019t too bothered how much my guests spent on us but I have to confess that I was seduced by the idea of getting mountains of stuff.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t to be. When we returned from our honeymoon, it quickly became apparent that the gifts I had coveted were never going to arrive.\nYou see, I never ended up getting my wedding gifts. Not because my guests weren\u2019t generous or because I was selfless and didn\u2019t ask for any but because the company I created my list with went into administration at the start of the credit crunch.\nThe kind and generous presents selected by our friends and family had disappeared into a black hole of debt, along with their money. Now when I think about wedding lists, I feel a tinge of sadness and I wish I\u2019d gone for something far simpler instead.\nLooking back now, I wonder if it was a sort of karma. I\u2019d let greed get in the way of the big day and focused too much on material possessions instead of the things that really mattered.\nIn the end, asking for the moon on a stick brought me nothing but pain. I wish now I had left it up to our guests to decide whether they gave us a gift instead of trying to micromanage the present-buying process.\nSince I married, I\u2019ve been to weddings where the bride and groom have asked their guests for thoughtful gestures instead of toasters or envelopes stuffed full of cash and I think they may be onto something. One friend asked guests for their favourite recipe to add to a scrapbook while another asked people to contribute a pearl of wisdom.\nBy not asking for extravagant presents, those couples have ended up with something far more precious and long-lasting than anything my gift list could ever have brought me. I imagine that book of recipes will be looked at and treasured long after the last plate of my designer dinner service would have become chipped and broken.\nIf I could have my time again, I\u2019d focus on the things that really matter about a wedding \u2013 spending time with friends and family and starting a new chapter with someone you love.

Really let it sink in.\nThat is the view of the candidate for Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee saying, in no uncertain terms, that winning a general election and forming a government, the reason political parties exist, should not be a priority.\nThis comes at a time when millions (and it really is millions) of people are being assaulted by a government that believes it can get away with policies even its own side think are reprehensible, because there is no viable opposition. Junior doctors are being dragged through a spiralizer. The criminal justice system is in the process of bleeding to death, having had its kneecaps blown off by an Uncle Fester tribute act.

Of course not.\u00a0 They are, however, rife among so many of her peers, and her ascension to a position of authority does nothing to address them. Besides, the consensus was that the Corbynistas were unelectable \nIt\u2019s ", "Being a Merseyide Anglican, my Dad used to refer to the rites of the Catholic Church as \u201cRoman mumbo\u00a0jumbo\u201d. He once gave a Catholic friend a lift to work, forgot the friend was a Catholic and \u2013 cursing another driver who cut in front of his car \u2013 shouted: \u201cWho does that damn fool think he is, the Pope?\u201d His friend declined all future lifts.\nI thought my father was a bit extreme, but I didn\u2019t like Popes very much either. Pope Pius XII, it seemed to me, failed in his duty to denounce the Nazis for their persecution of the Jews. I forgave Pope John Paul II his conservatism only because he infuriated George W. Bush by denouncing the 2003 Iraq war.\nBut I made peace with the Vatican when Pope Francis came along. I decided he was definitely a good guy when he went to Lampedusa in 2013 \u2013 long before the rest of our leaders started their lachrymosae for the refugees of the Middle East who were drowning in the Mediterranean \u2013 and asked if anyone had wept for the thousands who were dying in the coffin ships making for Italy. \u201cWe are a society which has forgotten how to weep, how to experience compassion,\u201d he said. Good on yer, Pope, I thought.\nThen up he popped again on Lesbos last month and took three Muslim refugee families back home to the Vatican. As Martin Schultz, President of the European Parliament, was to say, Pope Francis showed all of us \u201cwhat it means to be human\u201d.\nIf you thought all this was a bit of \u2018Roman mumbo-jumbo\u2019 dressed up as Christian charity, just listen to what the Pope had to say when he was awarded the European Charlemagne Prize this month. \u201cWhat has happened to you, the Europe of humanism, the champion of human rights, democracy and freedom?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat has happened to you, Europe, the mother of peoples and nations, the mother of great men and women who upheld, and even sacrificed their lives for, the dignity of their brothers and sisters?\u201d\nA big ouch. Especially from the regressive old men of eastern Europe who believe that they, and they alone, safeguard the blue-eyed, golden-haired birth right of Christian Europe.\nFirst we had the odious Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary telling us that his country was defending the frontiers of \u201cChristendom\u201d when it was corralling the Muslim refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan because \u201cIslam was never part of Europe\u201d.\nThen we had the Czech President, Milos Zeman \u2013 a left-wing politician \u2013 telling us that it was \u201cprobably impossible to integrate the Muslim community into European society\u201d, claiming earlier that the Muslim Brotherhood wanted to \u201ccontrol Europe\u201d.\nGiven Hungary\u2019s grotesque fascist history and its pro-Nazi government\u2019s dispatch of its Jews to Auschwitz, you\u2019d have thought Orban (born in a Hungarian\u00a0city which was the seat of its most anti-Semitic Catholic prelate, Bishop Ottaker \u2018the Jews are eating us up\u2019 Probaszka) might have spared us his lecture on European \u201cculture\u201d.\nFar worse, Orban was followed only a few days ago by no less than the Archbishop of Prague, Cardinal Dominik Jaruslav Duka, who decided not only to demean Muslims, but pissed mightily on Pope Francis himself.\n\u201cThe sensitivity of Pope Francis on social issues is different from ours in Europe,\u201d said this paragon of Christian virtue. \u201cPope Francis is popular and there are different sources of his popularity. He also comes from Latin America, where the gap between rich and poor is much bigger.\u201d As for Francis\u2019 Lesbos trip, \u201cit was just a gesture\u201d.\nI suppose time was when a Pope would have sent a flagon of poison off to his errant cardinal, or at least a Vatican assassin with a rusty knife, especially when the meddlesome priest compared him unfavourably to John Paul, \u201cwho was able to attract the attention of crowds but... he knew the history of Nazism and Communism and he knew how difficult was the fight for freedom.\u201d\nCardinal Duka even had a good word for the retired ex-Pope Benedict \u2013 the former Hitler Youth anti-aircraft gunner, who was also anti-abortion and claimed that Auschwitz was the product of a Nazi \u201cring of criminals\u201d in Berlin.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019d compare the language of these Popes [John Paul and Benedict] and their most frequent words, you\u2019d see a big difference,\u201d quoth Duka. \u201cHowever, you have to take society\u2019s mood into account.\u201d\nAh yes, Pope Francis had to bend to \u2018society\u2019s mood\u2019, didn\u2019t he? And after all he came from a country, poor man, with a big gap between rich and poor \u2013 as if this very social crisis was not endemic in every east European nation between the First and Second World Wars.\nEven Angela Merkel did not escape the cardinal\u2019s scorn. She and European federalists had demanded a \u201cwelcoming culture\u201d of accepting refugees from the Middle East, which was now dividing European societies and endangering their safety.\nNot for the cardinal any comment on Pope Francis\u2019 concern that the Mediterranean risked becoming a \u201cgraveyard\u201d. Not a word from the Archbishop of Prague for Francis\u2019 dream \u201cof a Europe where being a migrant is not a crime but a summons to greater commitment on behalf of the dignity of every human being.\u201d\nTo be fair, as they say, Cardinal Duka is also a brave man. He was persecuted by the Communists, imprisoned, and yet kept the faith.\u00a0 No-one should lecture Duka on suffering. Yet his words suggest that he cannot understand the suffering of those who are not of his religion.\nThat is his problem or, as those of the faith might say, his sin. After all, it\u2019s not as if the Catholic Church has an unblemished record in old Czechoslovakia.\nWhen Hitler broke the country in two, Father Jozef Tiso, a viciously anti-Semitic priest, became president of the Nazi \u2018Slovak Republic\u2019 \u2013 and enthusiastically supported the deportation of his country\u2019s Jews to Auschwitz, an exodus only temporarily halted when the Vatican intervened.\u00a0 Would that Duka could re-read the biography of this wretched son of the church;\u00a0Tiso wouldn\u2019t have indulged in \u2018gestures\u2019,\u00a0nor cared very much about \u2018society\u2019s mood\u2019.\nBut even Duka\u2019s current prime minister might reflect that Tiso must have thought it 'practically impossible to integrate\u2019 the Jewish community \u2018into European society\u2019. I know what my Dad would have said.", "It\u2019s 2016 and apparently the question of whether women at work are there to be looked at or to do their job is still up for discussion. A receptionist has spoken about how she turned up for her first day at work at a London office only to be told that her flat shoes were unacceptable and she must change into high heels. When she objected that walking in heels for a nine hour shift would be painful and unpractical and asked if any male employees were subject to the same dress code, she was laughed at and sent home without pay.\nWhat\u2019s most concerning is that the recruitment company which set the dress code appears to have been acting legally. While it is not explicitly allowed in law to insist that female employees wear high heels, it is legal to insist they look \u2018smart and professional\u2019 so long as different genders have equivalents.\nThe crux of the issue, then, is that social attitudes about what constitutes a smart and professional look for a woman seem to retain fetishised ideas of sexy secretaries and pin-up girls. Additionally, the general consensus is that there\u2019s no problem with expecting a woman to suffer a not inconsiderable amount of pain to conform to these expectations.\nHow a woman looks and conforms to the heterosexual male gaze is still the most important factor women are expected to use in guiding their decisions. Performing an idealised femininity is how she will be judged above how she performs in her job.\nWorryingly, this week\u2019s incident is far from an isolated one. As a recent university graduate, I\u2019ve seen many smart and talented female classmates and friends arrive at their first graduate job to be told that they must dress in a more feminine way, under the guise that it is a reasonable demand because it makes them look more \u2018smart\u2019 and \u2018professional\u2019.\nOne woman started a job at a national newspaper and was told to never again wear trousers because it was a \u2018traditional\u2019 office where women were expected to wear skirts. Another began work at a top law firm and was inducted into a \u2018sexy formal\u2019 workwear code for women who were expected to totter from courtroom to courtroom in stilettos.\nThis receptionist\u2019s experience has rightly caused outrage since news broke. But amid the horror the usual \u2018what about the men\u2019 arguments have emerged from various crevices and corners of the internet. Men wear suits and ties, they argue, which can be quite uncomfortable on a hot day. This is a false equivalence. Suits may sometimes be uncomfortable, but they do not inhibit a person\u2019s very ability to walk, or spark blisters and bloody sores. Crucially, a long history of sexualisation isn\u2019t sown into the seams of a suit jacket in the same way.\nMen do not struggle to be taken seriously for wearing particular kinds of suits, or come under pressure to alter suits to cling more to their calves, or feel the judging eyes of fellow men who deem they are flashing a bit too much ankle. The ubiquity and ease of a man\u2019s suit comes from the fact that it blends into the office background, remaining impersonal and covering most skin.\nFor men, the suit is synonymous with professionalism. But no clear female equivalent exists. This is largely because women have been shut out of most professions for so long that no uniform outfit has had time to establish itself in the same way.\nDress codes like these serve as reminders of the grim reality that women are still seen as fetishised commodities, with bodies that are considered society\u2019s property. They put into bleak, stark words the constant checklist of feminine behaviour which women are expected to subscribe to in every area of their life, writ large in employment contracts and employee codes of conduct. Above all, they prove that despite the many advancements women have made in the work place in the last century, a large section of society still isn\u2019t sure why we\u2019re really there: to work with or gawp at.", "Ashraf Ghani was four minutes into his speech when a young Afghan in the audience stood up and started shouting :\u201cYou are a liar! You have lied to the Afghan people and now you are lying to the world! I worked for you, I know all about you!\"\nThe august Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in Whitehall had not seen anything like this before. Stunned silence was followed by gasps as Afghan security men dragged the heckler, yelling \"You are a disgrace\u201d, at the Afghan President out of the auditorium. A shaken Mr Ghani restarted the address he had come to deliver after attending the international anti-corruption summit in London on Thursday.\nThe summit had started amid \nThree minutes later another young Afghan, in another part of the room, stood up. \u201cYou are a corrupt man! Everyone knows that! You are also a racist.\" He unfurled a poster before also being dragged out by the President\u2019s security men. \"Help me, they are beating me up! This is Britain, not Afghanistan!\u201d he cried as chairs overturned amid RUSI members sitting open-mouthed in astonishment.\nThere was a third interruption half an hour later, during questions. A \u00a0young woman berated Mr Ghani for presiding over an administration which is both inefficient and corrupt. A few of the security men moved towards her, but then hesitated, unsure what to do. She continued until the microphone was taken away from her.\nThe row was about an electricity transmission project in which power lines have been rerouted away from Bamiyan, a northern province with a predominantly Hazara population. The RUSI protestors were Hazaras; President Ghani is a Pashtun. There have been complaints that his government discriminates against the Hazaras.\nThe President insisted that he was prepared to engage in debate with his opponents. \u201cSee, even in the middle of a war, we are prepared to discuss and debate infrastructure issues. I am prepared to engage with these young people now\u201d he said. The two young men had been thrown out by then. \u201cI understand the anger of young people but your emotions are being exploited\u201d he told the young woman. She was not impressed by this, and told him so.\nThis episode, in a rather unlikely setting, was a glimpse of the turbulent politics and divisions of Afghanistan. There is a dark history behind Hazara claims of oppression. The Taliban, overwhelmingly Pashtun, had carried out massacres of the community during the country\u2019s civil war, and memories of what took place remain raw.\nMr Ghani, a former World Bank official backed by the West in the Presidential election two years ago, is facing rising unpopularity. Corruption remains endemic; Transparency International has moved Afghanistan down in its index to the third most corrupt in the world. At the same time, poverty levels continue to rise. The security situation in the country is worsening, with Isis and al-Qaeda joining the jihad. Swathes of territory have fallen to the insurgents and attacks on the capital, Kabul, take place with increasing frequency.\nMr Ghani has been blamed for contributing to the security failures. After coming into office he reversed the position of his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, who had blamed the Pakistani military and the country\u2019s secret police, ISI, for orchestrating the attacks. The new President went to see the head of the Pakistani military before meeting Paksitan\u2019s civilian government, a break with protocol. The hope was that the Pakistani military and ISI would bring the Taliban to the negotiating table and curb attacks.\nMr Ghani\u2019s critics, especially in the minority Hazara, Tajik and Uzbek communities, claim that he was setting up an intra-Pashtun deal with the Pakistanis and the Taliban. There is no evidence that the President was acting on sectarian motives. In any event, the gambit failed: no meaningful talks have taken place with Taliban and insurgent attacks have instead increased.\nIn his RUSI talks, Mr Ghani returned to the Afghan policy of blaming Pakistan for its ills and acknowledged that his attempts at rapprochement had failed. \u201cWhy is he surprised by this, everyone could see that\u2019s what will happen,\u201d said an Afghan student in the audience. \u201cStill, I have never been to RUSI before, I didn\u2019t realise it was going to be this exciting. But, you know, if you want to see proper violence you really should go to our parliament in Kabul.\u201d", "Morning all. Those of us who follow cricket closely are part of an international fraternity, whose bonds of friendship cross borders and eras. Never are those bonds more keenly felt than when one of our own passes away. The very sad news this week of the death of Tony Cozier, the great Caribbean journalist and avowedly amateur follower of the game, induced a collective mourning in us.\u00a0\nIt was very interesting to observe the same sentiment in various of the pieces written about Cozier \u2013 that is, the feeling that, one by one, the voices of our childhood are passing away. First Christopher Martin-Jenkins, the brilliant Telegraph and Times hack, whose match reports I devoured as a child, ascended to the great commentary box in the sky. Then Richie Benaud, the great leg-spinner who personified the game in the eyes of so many, also died. And this week Cozier, a brilliant Bajan to go with CMJ\u2019s Englishman and Benaud\u2019s Australian, breathed his last.\nMany of you will have been familiar with his byline because for many years he wrote for \nIn an age of sporting commentary that is dominated by former players, who charge fortunes for their alleged expertise, the cult of the amateur is more necessary than ever. Being an amateur, Cozier was always first and foremost on the side of the fans, which is why he was ostracised by the bureaucrats and idiots who have reduced cricket in the West Indies to a permanent state of embarrassment. I always feel it is wrong to be excessively wistful and nostalgic when people pass away, because it is often the last thing they would have wanted; and yet I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s impossible to resist the feeling that the death of Tony Cozier is a kind of celestial judgement on the sad, though not necessarily terminal, decline of the once great West Indies side.\nPlease watch out for a special souvenir edition on Leicester City\u2019s astonishing season, in which they went from 5000-1 outsiders to champions in one of the greatest sporting triumphs of all time.

To mark the occasion, we will be publishing a special edition containing the reporting, over a quarter of a century, of Robert Fisk, our Middle East Correspondent. This material straddles places and events that, despite being confined to one part of the world, are remarkably diverse. It also, as you know, includes writing that is widely held to be among the finest foreign reporting anywhere in the world during that time.\u00a0\nThese special editions, which are free to subscribers of The Independent Daily Edition, will I hope help to convince many of you of the argument I have been making for months: ", "The latest weary-making feminist outcry over women being requested to wear high-heels in public-facing jobs is further evidence to me that in modern terms, I have probably left the movement. Lump me in with The Patriarchy. I don\u2019t agree with much of what those boys do but, god damn, they get the job done, while we whinny over nothing. I knew I\u2019d lost the way with joke shop feminism 3.0 when our new saviour \u2018Slut Walk\u2019 organiser Amber Rose re-invented herself as Gloria Steinem by encouraging other deluded millennial clots to prance about dressed as Eighties\u00a0dad wank-aids Hot Gossip in order to increase respect-levels.\nBehaving like attention-seeking twats clad in tacky suspenders does little for the Sisterhood. Although\u00a0that\u2019s a farce too, mainly. I\u2019ve found most examples of the sisterhood, under closer scrutiny, merely to be stone cold networking and social climbing with a slender lipstick veneer. But that\u2019s an unpalatable truth too.\nAside from the heels and the slutwalks, I knew modern feminism and myself were deeply estranged during last month's outcry over young women being \u2018groped at gigs\u2019, as my first thought was that when I was sixteen,\u00a0getting titted up wildly in the melee at the Glasgow Barrowlands really was the best part. Then I identified this as a \u2018rape joke\u2019, which are never, ever in any context funny, and that I should probably hand myself into Sister Amber Rose for penance. She knows about these things.\u00a0\nSo, to get back to shoes, which are a feminist issue: outraged Nicola Thorpe, 27, is furious this week as her temporary job as a City firm receptionist specified she should wear heels. And, more upsetting still, they want her to wear makeup too. Thorpe's petition for the practice to be make illegal has gained 123,000 signatures. That\u2019s 123,000 modern feminists who\u2019d like to be able to sue their boss for specifying what\u00a0they look like when they\u2019re at work. This sort of stuff will sort the pay gap out. Bravo everyone.\nClearly I\u2019m impartial as I worked as a receptionist in the 1990s and happily wore both heels and a face of slap. Because when you\u2019re dealing with hundreds of strangers, bike couriers, grumpy security guards, drunks, tramps and lost tourists every hour, then the professional fem-bot costume is like your armour. Pencil skirt, lipstick, a cloud of perfume, three-inch heels, \u2018a nice skirt\u2019.\nWhen you\u2019re perched on the front desk of a company you reflect the entire mood of everything happening behind you. Yes, wacky digital agencies may well allow female receptionists to slouch about with greasy hair, clad in a\u00a0fisherman\u2019s jumper, Crocs and a lovely moustache to reflect their latest fascinating gender-neutral shtick. However, it\u2019s safe to say if you have a job somewhere safely corporate \u2013 where the pay will more favourable than serving pasties at Greggs \u2013 they\u2019ll require you to look like Sigourney Weaver in \nThe world, I can assure you, treats a professional woman differently in heels. It treats a woman differently in exactly the same manner it treats a man differently wearing an uncomfortable, hot, tediously traditional suit. A suit \u2013 for several reasons \u2013\u00a0makes a man become suddenly more trustworthy. He looks more like a person who rose early, knows his way round a spreadsheet and has a five-year plan.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors of course, but that\u2019s why The Patriarchy\u00a0have no problem at all sticking a shirt, tie and brogues on from nine-to-five\u00a0on weekdays, then milking dry all the plaudits and kick-backs that come with it. They don\u2019t waste a week in May with a whiny petition demanding to wear camo shorts and espadrilles. The Patriarchy soars onwards and upwards, while the increasingly silly Sisterhood are signing petitions.\u00a0", "\u201cI\u2019m probably about the only politician I know of who is actually willing to stand up and say that he\u2019s pro-immigration,\u201d said Boris Johnson. But that was then \u2013 2013, the year in which he called for a one-off amnesty for illegal immigrants.\nJohnson has travelled a long way since. The pro-Brexit camp\u2019s best known face was accused of racism after he hit back at Barack Obama\u2019s intervention in the EU debate by referring to \u201cthe part-Kenyan President\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British empire\u201d.\u00a0 Last night (Friday) he and his fellow Leavers were accused by Sir John Major of \u201cmorphing into Ukip\u201d and playing the immigration card.\nThe former Mayor of London may soon be travelling to Downing Street. Although he characteristically dismissed as \u201ccobblers\u201d the idea that Cameron would step down after a Brexit vote next month, few Conservative MPs expect the Prime Minister to survive for long if that happens. Johnson would be the clear frontrunner to succeed him.\nImmigration is not the only issue on which Johnson has changed his mind. I remember when he used to say the EU was good for the City of London. After his unexpected last-minute conversion to the Brexit cause, he insisted the City would \u201cflourish mightily\u201d outside the bloc. Johnson admits he has changed, but claims the EU has changed more.\nMany Conservative MPs are convinced that Johnson made a calculated decision that, with two out of three Tory party members backing Brexit, backing a Leave vote would enhance his leadership prospects more than sticking with Cameron, as the Prime Minister expected him to do. The word on the Tory grapevine is that Sir Lynton Crosby, the Australian strategist who helped both Cameron and Mayor Boris win elections, advised Johnson to opt for Out. Johnson doesn\u2019t deny it, telling \nJohnson, who this week accused Cameron of predicting \u201cWorld War Three\u201d if we left the EU, is not having a good war so far.\u00a0 He was in typically bouncy, confident form when he launched his red battlebus in Cornwall. But Sarah Newton, a local Tory MP, dubbed it Boris\u2019s \u201cblunder bus\u201d after he brandished a Cornish pasty without knowing\u00a0 it was EU laws that protect pasty-makers from being undercut by inferior imports.\nLike others in the Leave camp, Johnson has struggled to provide a vision of what life would be like outside the EU. First he talked about Britain being like Switzerland, then it was a Canada-style free-trade deal, then a special EU trade deal for the UK, now it is about \u201caccess\u201d to the EU market \u2013 without having to allow EU citizens to come to Britain, of course.\nYet Johnson has also conceded that it might be hard to get such a wonderful deal from the EU if we left, telling \nJohnson\u2019s two-and-a-half hour grilling by the committee was uncomfortable. Andrew Tyrie, its Tory chairman, was not impressed with what he called a \u201cbusking, humorous approach to a very serious question for the UK\u201d. Tyrie found Johnson unable to substantiate his previous claims that the EU had banned children aged under eight from blowing up balloons and forbidden the recycling of tea bags. The word has spread at Westminster about Johnson\u2019s performance. Even some fellow Outers admit it damaged his credibility. \u201cWe might look back on it as a turning point, when some people started to sell shares in Boris,\u201d one said.\nJohnson also had unfavourable reviews after appearing on the BBC\u2019s \nNo wonder George Osborne, the Chancellor and Johnson\u2019s main rival for the Tory crown, speaks of the need for \u201csober, serious, principled\u201d leadership. Some Tories talk up Michael Gove, Johnson\u2019s fellow Vote Leave leader, as a more serious alternative to Boris. Gove is genuine when he says he does not want to be prime minister. But, to borrow Johnson\u2019s words, if \u201cthe ball came loose from the scrum,\u201d Gove might just run with it.\nJohnson remains the hot favourite, even though some wise old Tory heads judge that he needs to prove himself in a big Cabinet post to show he is qualified for the top job \u2013 health, perhaps, where Jeremy Hunt is being tipped for respite care in another department if Cameron wins the referendum.\nThese Tory greybeards believe Boris might be ready to be prime minister one day, but is not ready yet. Cameron can\u2019t say it, as he must pretend he would carry on if he loses the referendum, but the logical conclusion is: if you would rather Dave run the country than Boris, vote to stay in the EU.", "1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \u200f\n7. \n8. \n9. \n10. \nAn honourable mention this week for Rod Morris: he said\u00a0Nimrod, the aircraft, stood for\u00a0\nNext week: Bands that were renamed with the lead singer\u2019s name on top, such as Diana Ross and the Supremes\nComing soon: Journalist-politicians, after Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, leaders of the EU Leave campaign", "Yesterday, I took a train through central London. That sounds unremarkable \u2013 millions of people do this every day. But getting on that train is something that, in the last six months, I have been unable to do.\nLate last year, I was caught up in the Paris terror attacks. This led to a resurgence of the post-traumatic stress disorder I had developed \u00ad\u2013 but largely got over \u2013 after a man tried to strangle me to death in 2010. As a result, almost overnight, the world became set with traps, crawling with men who were determined to kill me.\nEvery unattended bag, police car, low flying helicopter, sudden noise or movement or sign of \u201csuspicious\u201d behaviour convinced me that another terror attack was unfolding. Every minor symptom was a life threatening illness. Every unanswered text was a dead family member or friend.\nIn my sleep, I heard French sirens, felt the cold metal of a gun being held to my head. I still do, some nights.\nI don\u2019t write this to invite pity, but to highlight how mental illness can afflict anyone \u2013 even people like me.\nFrom the outside, I am a functioning member of society. I write columns in national newspapers, I go to the office, I see my friends, I go for weekends away. But while I\u2019m doing these things, and though you\u2019d never know it, I might at the same time be imagining myself lying on a pavement bleeding to death, or dying of cancer. But I suppose if you\u2019d seen sobbing my heart out on the bus last week, as my legs shook beneath me because I was convinced there was a bomb on board, you might have some kind of inkling.\nIt seems not a day goes by without the issue of mental health entering our national consciousness, whether a public figure has opened up about their own struggle or another report is published on the funding crisis in mental health services.\nThis week, the actress Sheridan Smith faced stigma and abuse as she was signed off for up to a month from the West End show Funny Girl, in which she plays a leading role, because of stress and exhaustion.\nWe also heard of the suicide of author and agony aunt Sally Brampton, a woman who fought depression for many years and whose 2008 memoir \nIn the years since Brampton\u2019s memoir was first published, the way we talk about mental illness has undergone a heartening transformation. Social media \u2013 so often criticised as a meretricious lens through which we show only the sunniest aspects of our lives \u2013 has provided many people struggling with mental illness with an outlet.\nFacebook support groups and message boards abound; news feeds are populated by members naming \u201cthree good things\u201d that happened to them today. When a friend on social media shared publicly that he was battling depression, the response under his post was sympathetic, kind and encouraging. When another male friend said, matter of factly, that he regularly goes to see a therapist I felt an overwhelming sense of pride.\nIn the middle of a male suicide epidemic that is killing our fathers, our brothers, our boyfriends, husbands and sons, public conversations like these are crucial. Anyone who has felt the way mental illness constricts your world, making it smaller and lonelier, knows that another human puncturing the foggy barrier you inhabit, through understanding, tenderness and support, has the ability to save a life.\nAnd while it\u2019s important to highlight the stigma faced by Sheridan Smith and others who are honest about their condition, it\u2019s vital too that we celebrate this new openness too. It is a sign of the most stupendous progress.\nIn 2015, Matt Haig\u2019s \nPartly as a result of Haig\u2019s success, the mental health memoir has become a publishing phenomenon. A \n\u201cPeople \u2013 high-functioning, highly successful people \u2013 are crying out to talk about their struggles with mental health,\u201d she wrote in the original article. \u201cNo one would feel ashamed discussing an arrhythmia: why should an instability in the brain be taboo over one in the heart?\u201d Morgan\u2019s refreshing book is written in the frank, confiding, witty voice of a person facing and trying to make sense a tide of psychological bullshit; a person who could, ultimately, be any one of us.\nThe journalist Bryony Gordon is also shortly to release her second memoir, entitled \nThese are just two examples of a publishing trend with more to come, from Bryony Kimmings and Tim Grayburn\u2019s \nWe are making progress. To hear another person open up about their difficulties has the effect of making people like me not just feel less alone, but also less ashamed. Because, though the external stigma of mental illness is significant and damaging, it is often never nearly so bad as the stigma we create for ourselves.\nI felt ashamed to tell you that I am often too frightened to get on a train. I felt that it exposed me as weak, or a failure, or a nutter.\nBut I told you anyway, because writers such as Brampton and Haig, Morgan and Gordon, gave me permission to do so with my head held high. And that, on its own, is huge.", "Can corruption be controlled by reform or is it so much the essential fuel sustaining political elites that it will only be ended \u2013 if it ends at all \u2013 by revolutionary change?\nThe answer varies according to which countries one is talking about, but in many - particularly those relying on the sale of natural resources like oil or minerals - it is surely too late to expect any incremental change for the better. Anti-corruption drives are a show to impress the outside world or to target political rivals.\nThe anti-corruption summit in London this week may improve transparency and disclosure, but it can scarcely be very effective against politically well-connected racketeers, busily transmuting political power into great personal wealth.\nThis is peculiarly easy to do in those countries in the Middle East and Africa which suffer from what economists call \u201cthe resource curse\u201d, where states draw their revenues directly from foreign buyers of their natural resources. The process is described in compelling detail by Tom Burgis in his book, \nBurgis explains the devastating outcome of a government acquiring such great wealth without doing more than license foreign companies to pump oil or excavate minerals. This \u201ccreates a pot of money at the disposal of those who control the state. At extreme levels the contract between rulers and the ruled breaks down because the ruling class does not need to tax the people \u2013 so it has no need for their consent.\u201d\nHe writes primarily about Africa south of the Sahara, but his remarks apply equally to the oil states of the Middle East. He rightly concludes that \u201cthe resource industry is hardwired for corruption. Kleptocracy, or government by theft, thrives. Once in power, there is little incentive to depart.\u201d Autocracy flourishes, often same ruler staying for decades.\nMost, but not all, of this is true of the Middle East oil producers. A difference is that most of these have patronage and client systems through which oil wealth funds millions of jobs. This goes a certain way in distributing oil revenues among the general population, though the benefits are unfairly skewed towards political parties or dominant sectarian and ethnic groups.\nIn Iraq there are seven million state employees and pensioners out of a population of 33 million who are paid $4bn a month or a big chunk of total oil income. Often these employees don\u2019t do much or, on occasion, anything at all, but it is an exaggeration to imagine that Iraq\u2019s oil money is all syphoned off by the ruling elite.\nI remember in one poor Shia province in south Iraq talking to local officials who said that they had just persuaded the central government to pay for another 50,000 jobs, though they admitted that they had no idea what these new employees would be doing.\nReformers frequently demand that patronage be cut back in the interests of efficiency, but a more likely outcome of such a change is that a smaller proportion of the population would benefit from the state income.\nThis could be the result of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s radical plans to transform the way Saudi Arabia is run and end its reliance on oil by 2030. He may well find that the way Saudi society works has long gelled and face strong resistance to changing a system in which ordinary Saudis feel entitled to some sort of job and salary.\nThe \u201cresource curse\u201d is not readily reversible, because it eliminates other forms of economic activity. The price of everything produced in an oil state is too expensive to compete with the same goods made elsewhere so oil becomes the only export. Migrants pour in as local citizens avoid manual labour or employment with poor pay and conditions.\nA further consequence of the curse is that the rulers of resource rich states \u2013 like many an individual living on an unearned income \u2013 get an excessive and unrealistic idea of their own abilities. Saddam Hussein was the worst example of such megalomania, starting two disastrous wars against Iran and Kuwait. But the Shah of Iran was not far behind the Iraqi leader in grandiose ideas, blithely ordering nuclear power stations and Concorde supersonic passenger aircraft.\nMuammur Gaddafi insisted that Libyans study the puerile nostrums of the Green Book, and those failing that part of the public examinations about the book, were failed generally and had to re-take all their exams again.\nCan \u201cthe looting machine\u201d in the Middle East, Africa and beyond be dismantled or made less predatory?\nIts gargantuan size and centrality to the interest of ruling classes probably makes its elimination impossible, though competition, transparency and more effective bureaucratic procedures in the award of contracts might have some effect. The biggest impulse to resistance locally to official corruption has come because the fall in the price of oil and other commodities since 2014 means that the revenue cake has become too small to satisfy all the previous beneficiaries.\nThe mechanics and dire consequences of this system are easily explained though often masked by neo-liberal rhetoric about free competition.\nIn authoritarian states without accountability or a fair legal system, this approach becomes a license to loot. Corruption cannot be tamed because it is at the very heart of the system.", "A headline in the \nI am all for turning nouns into verbs if they are short, vivid and clear, but \u201cstalemated\u201d is horrible.\nFirst, turning the ending \u201c-mate\u201d into a verb has completely the wrong connotation. I won\nIn any case, stalemate is the wrong word. You don\u2019t have to know much about chess to know that a stalemate is a draw, and that it is the end of the game. It jars, therefore, to use it to mean a temporary impasse, which might be \u201cbroken\u201d and after which the contest\u00a0might resume.\nThat was explicitly the sense in which we used the word: the story was that Trump and Ryan were expected to meet two days later to try to resolve their differences.\nI suspect many readers find the phrase \u201c20-year veteran\u201d confusing. It is a common form in American reporting, but I read it as \u201c20-year-old veteran\u201d. There is nothing wrong with the journalese \u201cveteran\u201d to mean \u201clong-serving\u201d, but if that is what we mean, let us just say it.\u00a0\nThen we come to al-Naimi\u2019s replacement: \u201csomeone who he directly controls the actions of.\u201d What a mess. Let\u2019s see how the sentence could be rewritten. The Deputy Crown Prince \u201creplaced long-serving oil minister Ali al-Naimi with someone he can rely on to carry out his wishes\u201d. It requires only a moment\u2019s thought.\u00a0\nThe second example brought me up short. I had a vision of a four-rotored toy hovering over some paperwork.\u00a0\nI think we meant that the \u201ctiny airborne vessels\u201d, an elegant variation deployed to avoid repeating \u201cdrones\u201d, would be used to do such things as to check fire damage in inaccessible parts of buildings. We could have said that.\u00a0\nUpholding is something a superior court does when it confirms a decision of a lower one, or it means to maintain a tradition or practice. No doubt the beliefs and behaviour of many ", "With his big win in Indiana and the suspension of Ted Cruz and John Kasich\u2019s campaigns, Donald Trump is assured to be the Republican Party nominee in the Presidential race. The billionaire Real Estate tycoon indeed has a large support base of individuals who are sick and tired of the current political system in America.\nHowever, Trump seems to be a fan of conspiracy theories. In fact, it seems to be part of his political pitch. He has shared his views on the idea that\u00a0Obama was not born in the US, over Ted Cruz's father being the person who helped to kill John F. Kennedy and, on social media, he has\u00a0posted arguments claiming there is a link between the autism \u2018epidemic\u2019 and vaccines.\nAs someone who lives with autism, I am angered and disgusted by Donald Trump\u2019s position on the correlation between vaccines and autism. The very fact that he believes in the myth of an autism epidemic is detestable, but worse is the fact that he\u00a0uses those with autism as vulgar props to gain attention for his campaign. Because of his endorsement of this ridiculous theory,\u00a0he\u00a0provides publicity for snake oil sellers\u00a0who actively exploit autism sufferers and their families.\nDonald Trump has no\u00a0record in\u00a0helping those with autism,\u00a0or even showing an ounce of care. His only interest in autism is the posting of\u00a0misleading comments on social media.\nNobody exactly knows why Donald Trump believes the conspiracy. Perhaps he is close to people who genuinely believe in these theories, and\u00a0he is really is unsure about the causes of autism. Perhaps he really wants to find an answer to explain why autism is becoming more prevalent \u2013\u00a0even if the rise in autism cases is, in fact,\u00a0mainly due to better screening and awareness.\nSome people who believe in the ''vaccines cause autism'' conspiracy can have ulterior motives, but most hold on to these theories for more personal reasons: it's a way to find answers, or a culprit for this complicated condition.\u00a0It's is very challenging for any parent, sibling or friend to live with and help someone who is debilitated by autism.\nOne thing is for sure: the large number of people in the United States who believe in these conspiracy theories\u00a0will follow Trump in a misleading quest for the truth. They\u00a0believe that he is on their side, that he just\u00a0wants to know the truth too.\nTrump is a rich man, and his money could be used as a force for good to help people with autism, for example by\u00a0setting up a foundation, or offering scholarships for students with autism to help them achieve a\u00a0good education with the correct support.\nSadly, it is not medicine but conspiracy that his\u00a0guiding his policies towards autism as a potential future US president. He will be running against the Democrat\u00a0Hillary Clinton, who, while a very successful politician, is not particularly popular as a candidate. As a person living with autism,\u00a0Trump in the White House is a both a\u00a0plausible\u00a0and very worrying\u00a0possibility.", "EUNavforMed \u2013 or Operation Sophia, to give the gig its more romantic title \u2013 is a real success story.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the \u201cfailure\u201d the House of Lords would have us believe in their mean-minded report. EU ships have saved more than 9,000 souls among the poor and huddled masses crossing the Mediterranean, the refuse of Libya\u2019s \u201cteeming shore\u201d. It is a stunning success for the humanitarianism of the EU \u2013 an institution which Britain is thinking of leaving.\nBut such is the immoral nature of our reaction to this catastrophic human crisis that our political masters did not dare to put human lives ahead of tackling criminality when they launched the whole fandango a year ago. Well aware that millions of Europeans were not too keen on rescuing the refugees and migrants drowning in Mare Nostrum (and quite a few, alas, rather keen that these poor folk might expire \nPersonally, I\u2019d rather he hunted down the arms smugglers who are the cause of this bloody tragedy.\u00a0 But that would mean arresting all kinds of well-off gents from the Gulf, Turkey and, indeed, Libya \u2013 along with CIA agents, Russian spooks and quite a few intelligence outfits even closer to home. Impossible.\nSo having told us this was all about criminality, Dave and the lads have to faff on about driving \u2018wedges\u2019 into people-smuggling Mafiosi who are supposedly the real culprits.\nNow that we\u2019ve bribed the Turks with a regular annual wodge of greens and easy visas to Europe for their own migrants, rather than the more desperate kind from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, the immediate problem is that we can\u2019t bribe the Libyan government in the same way.\u00a0 First, because it doesn\u2019t exist, thanks partly to our own messing in that tripartite nation, and second because we don\u2019t really have much enthusiasm to send our marines to the shores of Tripoli.\nAfter all, dispatching our commandoes to Arab lands \u2013 with or without permission from the relevant dictators \u2013 to shoot down the desperados who are packing the coffin ships with human flotsam would immediately bring us into conflict with all kinds of chaps: Isis, al-Qaeda, Nusrah, Boko Haram, freelance militias, Arab government ministers, Gulf allies and Washington cut-outs.\u00a0\nWe\u2019d have to use precision bombing and lots of drones and then, before we knew it and as per usual, we\u2019d be blowing up the camps, clinics and hospitals used by the refugees as well as the gunmen and smugglers before the homeless, \u2018tempest-tossed\u2019 migrants even dipped their toes in the sea.\nIt\u2019s highly instructive that one of the most recent EU puffs for Operation Sophia puts the rescue of human life first on its list of mission objectives \u2013 which is where it should be \u2013 and only then waffles on about smugglers.\nThere\u2019s one killer line at the end, however, that hits us old Middle East hands like a whiplash.\u00a0The purpose of the whole EU project, we are told, is to \u201ctackle the root causes\u201d of the refugee tragedy.\nSurely not? For that would mean we\u2019ve got to talk about justice, dignity and freedom for the people of the Middle East \u2013 which means we\u2019ve got to redesign our policies towards Islam, history, Arab dictators, Israel, the Palestinians, the Kurds.\u00a0\nWe may even have to re-examine our views of Europe, even of the EU. And if we\u2019re going to set sail across the Mediterranean with that kind of ambition, we\u2019d better follow the example of Admiral Lord Nelson who held his telescope to his blind eye at the Battle of Copenhagen and remember what he supposedly\u00a0said: \u201cI see no ships!\u201d", "This week I indulged in a habit of hope. It\u2019s the most optimistic act of my year and something that I do entirely for myself.

I went to drama school in London and spent a while afterwards doing extra work and auditions.\nI\u2019d just made a film when I met my husband, had two children and settled down in Shropshire. When I was at drama school a tutor told me, \u201cYou can either have children or have an acting career, you can\u2019t have both.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t believe that was true. But then my children were diagnosed with autism, my younger daughter with an accompanying learning disability, and my mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s. So I put my creative aspirations to one side.\nThe thing is, creativity is not easily silenced. So I wrote. Two novels, one screenplay, one stage play, two TV comedy dramas, one YA novel and a sitcom to be exact.\nNone were published, except the stage play\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and that\u2019s only because I set up a theatre company myself.

I see starting this business as an incredible opportunity to really take hold of my life and mould it to suit me.\u201d\nThere is a wealth of talent in women of all ages and I recognise the brilliance of young women and older women equally.\nI hope that I can achieve my creative ambition. I\u2019ve loved my life, I love being a carer, I love writing articles about the issues that matter to me, and I love campaigning for equality.\nIt\u2019s a terrifying prospect at 50 to try to re-enter a profession where rejection is par for the course. But not trying at all seems like a much more frightening thing to me.\nMy biggest inspiration is Margaret Rutherford. She was 50 when she had her big break. Or perhaps I\u2019m a latter-day Florence Foster Jenkins without the money, harbouring a creative wish but bereft of talent.\nEither way, I\u2019m happy to plod on.\u00a0", "The Dutch daily \nThis was a reference to a Dutch journalist detained in Turkey after sending tweets deemed critical of Erdogan. She has since been freed, and has now been allowed to leave the country.\nTurks have a great sense of humour and for a number of years have made fun of Erdogan in cartoons pointing to the power he has acquired for himself.\nIn 2005, a cartoonist was fined for depicting Erdogan as a cat entangled in a ball of wool. But in another trial that followed, a satirical magazine was acquitted after a cover depicting a menagerie with Erdogan\u2019s face on each animal.\u00a0As the court admonished, \u201cThe owners of political power should be open and tolerant to all kinds of criticisms.\u201d\nBut little has that helped.\u00a0Since Erdogan was elected president in 2014, almost 2,000 cases have been brought against people for insulting the president.\u00a0Last September, the Turkish weekly \nLast week, in a new blow to the freedom of the press in Turkey, the editor-in-chief of the secular daily newspaper \nOutside the courthouse, after sentence was passed, D\u00fcndar narrowly escaped assassination by a man who shouted \u201ctraitor\u201d while firing the shots.\nThanks to German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s appeasement policy President Erdogan\u2019s long arm now also extends to Europe. After the comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann read his anti-Erdogan poem on German TV, Erdogan\u2019s German lawyer applied for \u2013 and was granted \u2013 a court injunction against an online video in support of the comedian.\nHis lawyer also applied for an injunction against Mathias D\u00f6pfner, the CEO of the Axel Springer media group, who had, in a letter, also supported B\u00f6hmermann.\u00a0However, in refusing that injunction,\u00a0\nNevertheless, everybody seems to want to join in \u2013\u00a0including \nIn a counter-offensive, the Turkish consulate in Holland has sent an email to Turkish organisations, asking them \u201curgently for the names and written comments of people who have given derogatory, disparaging, hateful and defamatory statements against the Turkish president, Turkey and Turkish society in general\u201d in emails or social media such as Twitter or Facebook.\nFurthermore, the Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders has warned Dutch citizens planning to travel to Turkey on holiday that he could give no guarantees of their safety if they have been critical of the Turkish president.

Boris Johnson, who is now a mere backbench Member of Parliament, having ceased to be Mayor of London, made a fool of himself on the radio on Wednesday. He sounded evasive when it was put to him that he had written an article advocating Remain and another advocating Leave before coming out for Brexit three months ago.\u00a0\nThe Leave campaign embarrassed itself by issuing a late-night statement condemning ITV and its political editor, Robert Peston, in the most hysterical terms, for having the temerity to book Nigel Farage \u2013 who is not part of the official Leave campaign \u2013 to appear after the Prime Minister in a TV show.\u00a0\nFor a group of people who hold themselves out as capable of handling the complex international trade negotiations that would follow a Brexit vote, Mr Johnson and the Leave campaign come across as divided, unstable and angry.\u00a0\nOn the other side, the case made by the Remain campaign seems to continue to strengthen. The Prime Minister\u2019s speech on Monday was mocked by some as \u201cpredicting World War Three\u201d if Britain left the EU. In fact, he made the reasonable point that the history of the European continent has too often been one of military conflict, and that, while the EU has not been the only cause of relative peace since 1945, it has undoubtedly been a factor.\u00a0\nThe interventions on Thursday and Friday respectively of Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, and Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, were more significant. In both cases, the individuals with great personal credibility with the British electorate are backed by highly trusted organisations.The Bank of England\u2019s analysis, for example, was backed by all nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee.\u00a0\nThe sheer weight of the consensus that leaving the EU is likely to cause lasting damage to the British economy is almost embarrassing \u2013 \u201c36-nil\u201d as one Number\u00a010 official described it privately to \nAnd yet our ComRes opinion poll today finds that, among the general public, Mr Johnson is thought to be more likely to \u201ctell the truth about the EU\u201d by twice as many people as think that of Mr Cameron. What is more, the Leave campaign generally is considered more likely to tell the truth than the Remainers.\u00a0\nThis is, we hope, a useful warning against complacency, and a measure of the yawning chasm between elite and popular opinion in Britain today. Despite \u2013 and perhaps in part because of \u2013 the overwhelming consensus among figures of authority that EU membership is in Britain\u2019s interest, many people feel that they are being bamboozled by the well-educated, the rich and the establishment.\u00a0\nThere is something in this. Many of the \u201celite\u201d thought adopting the euro was a good idea, and were slow to accept that there were downsides to the free movement of EU workers.\u00a0\nSo it is to be hoped that \u201cStronger In\u201d, having established the macroeconomic case for staying in the EU, is able in the final weeks to make the campaign more streetwise. Our poll suggests that the economic case is cutting through. By a small and slightly growing margin, more people think that they personally would be better off if Britain stayed in the EU.\u00a0\nIn the final stretch of the campaign, Mr Cameron \u2013 along with Jeremy Corbyn, Alan Johnson, Tim Farron, Nicola Sturgeon, Leanne Wood\u00a0and grassroots campaigners throughout the UK \u2013\u00a0need to redouble their efforts to make it clear that the case for the EU is not an establishment conspiracy \u2013 the establishment just happens to agree with it because it is right.", "After my night shift on call as a trauma and orthopaedic surgery registrar, I grabbed a quick coffee, jumped in my car and drove to the station to catch the train to the British Medical Association annual conference. I didn\u2019t switch on the radio this morning, or listen to my favourite soundtrack:\u00a0my mind raced ahead to the event. The government and the BMA have been in talks for a week and we heard only yesterday that they are to be extended. The conference could not come at a more poignant time. It was also a good chance to gauge the atmosphere of my junior doctor colleagues during these critical talks.\u00a0\nIn my first five years as a doctor, the moments I remember clearest are those that were most challenging:\u00a0trying and failing to save an elderly lady bleeding to death in front of me with her eight children waiting outside to hear news. Holding a wife's hand as her young husband died of a sudden complication of a terminal illness. Standing with her in the few last minutes of his life faded, seeing her pain at losing the time they thought they had left together. Telling a child we had to put a tube in daddy\u2019s throat and he was asleep because he had a sudden and life threatening asthma attack whilst taking her out for the day.\u00a0\nThese have been immensely challenging situations for me to deal with, not only in my medical capacity: processing them emotionally is understandably difficult. It is those moments that define to me what it means to be a doctor, not only because of the story of each patient and their family, but also the story of what came next. Each time\u00a0my colleagues rallied, finding a quiet space, looking each other in the eye, a quiet nod to acknowledge we knew how each other was feeling, that we could have done no more. Each time, someone shed a tear, another one offered a hug and took the bleep away to give you ten minutes to reflect. Someone always made\u00a0a cup of tea.\u00a0\nI'm told the army develop incredible bonds with their colleagues in battle that last a lifetime:\u00a0it is a coping strategy as much as it is emotionally a necessity. Doctors too, I believe, develop these bonds and nevermore than over the last six months of this ongoing contract dispute.\u00a0\nWhen I walked into the BMA conference, though no one was being resuscitated, it felt like the aftermath of one of these challenging situations. Never before have I walked into a doctor\u2019s conference when each new member being greeted with a hug, a cup of tea or a knowing look. The unity and comradery in the room is palpable and emotional.\u00a0\nMotion after motion was debated, all sorts of topics and suggestions made, ranging from Brexit to workforce planning, from the current dispute to which specialty is the most attractive. There is heathy debate, laughter and optimism.\nOf course there is a nervousness about the ongoing talks, but the bonds we'd developed over the last six months as the dispute has raged on meant few words needed to be spoken. It goes without saying that there is a cautious optimism whilst simultaneously a steadfast and solid resolve that the junior doctors contract must be acceptable to the tens of thousands of junior doctors who took unified action.\nI have spoken to so many junior doctors today who told me they had never been to one of these conferences, nor been involved with these sorts of discussions at national levels, yet felt compelled to get involved this year. In the face of everything it is surprisingly buoyant and optimistic.\nMost palpable is the passion, commitment and resolve of junior doctors. One doctor I met was spending his 30th birthday at the conference with us today and another had just got engaged this morning leaving her new fianc\u00e9 10 minutes after the proposal to make it to the meeting. You could say, junior doctors are as dedicated to their cause, a safe NHS and their patients as they are to the most significant events in their own personal lives.\u00a0", "When David Cameron said he was the \u201cheir to Blair\u201d, he didn\u2019t realise that he was doing a deal like that struck by Jafar, the Grand Vizier of Agrabah in \nCameron copied \u201cthe Master\u201d, as he used to call him, and acquired some of Tony Blair\u2019s phenomenal electoral powers \u2013 winning an election everyone expected him to lose \u2013 but he too has to pay a price. Like Blair, he is going to be trapped for ever in his own party\u2019s disapproval.\nAs \nCameron\u2019s unpopularity with his own is, as yet, nothing like the full carnival of loathing with which the Labour Party celebrates its former leader. That took 13 years to mature after the Iraq war, and the crucial event in breaking Cameron\u2019s reputation with the members of his own party hasn\u2019t even happened yet. But in six weeks\u2019 time, if the British people vote to stay in the European Union, the great betrayal thesis will start to curdle into proper animosity.\u00a0\nYou can tell that the Leavers are preparing for defeat. The \nThe parallels with the conspiracy theories of the less reality-based supporters of Scottish independence are uncanny. In the Scottish referendum, the SNP campaigned against \u201cBBC bias\u201d \u2013 and against Nick Robinson, then the BBC\u2019s political editor, in person.\u00a0\nIf the Leave campaign loses the referendum, the mythology of treachery will soon be complete. The Leavers will need no Chilcot inquiry to establish the causes of their defeat. Media bias, an establishment stitch-up and dossier-loads of so-called facts sexed up by spin doctors in No 10 will be to blame.\u00a0\nFriday\u2019s report from the International Monetary Fund, warning of a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d if Britain leaves the EU, could be the \u201c45 minutes\u201d of the conspiracy theory of a stolen referendum. Already, sharp-eyed observers have noted that the Bank of England, in its warning of the consequences of Brexit on Thursday, used the same phrase, \u201ctechnical recession\u201d. The technical definition of a recession being two successive quarters of negative growth (or shrinkth, as it should be called). Suspicious, eh?\nFar more than Iraq, which, people forget, was supported by conventional opinion at the time, Britain's EU membership is overwhelmingly backed by all sources of authority. Not just the IMF and the Bank of England, but the Treasury, the leaderships of all parties except Ukip, and by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Pope.\u00a0\nFar from meaning that the Leavers will accept defeat with good grace, this is likely to intensify the feeling that the Remainers triumphed as the result of an elite conspiracy against the rough-hewn good sense of the British people.\u00a0\nWhich might not matter to Cameron, except that the membership of his own party are predominantly Leavers. \u201cTheir hearts beat in that direction,\u201d as I\u2019m told he said recently. A \nIf that is how Tory members divide on 23 June \u2013 and it could easily be higher \u2013 they are not going to forgive Cameron easily for selling the country down the Rhine, or whichever river Brussels is on (the Zenne or Senne).\u00a0\nThat is why Boris Johnson is in such a strong position to succeed Cameron, whether the referendum is won or lost. Half of Tory MPs, who draw up the shortlist of two candidates, are Outers, and then the Eurosceptic party members make the final choice.\u00a0\nAnd that is why, even if he wins the referendum, Cameron will find that governing is like \u201cdriving with the handbrake on\u201d, as Blair described his final years. Blair was talking about the effect of Gordon Brown on him, but Brown had that leverage only because Iraq had broken Blair\u2019s support in the wider Labour Party. Cameron will find that Johnson, whatever post he holds in the ironically named reconciliation reshuffle after the referendum, will have the same effect on his government.\u00a0\nEurope is Cameron\u2019s Iraq. If he gets his way, his party will hate him for ever. Like Blair before him, he is going to be sucked back into the lamp, Aladdin\u2019s \u201citty bitty living space\u201d, where he could be trapped for the rest of time.", "It all started with a passing thought,\u00a0a thought that women might just be more than what was expected of us. In the past one hundred years or so, that thought became an ideology, a political debate and a bottom line to every woman\u2019s response to an outrageous action \u2013\u00a0I can do it, because I have the ability to choose.\u00a0I chose to couple the most unlikely of ideas together: feminism and beauty pageants.\u00a0\nI remember the day I became a feminist.\u00a0I was seventeen, watching the film \nThis was also the year I was scouted to compete to be the most beautiful woman\u00a0in England.\nI was minding my own business at \nIt\u2019s been four years and I\u2019ve never looked back. Why? How can I be a feminist and compete in beauty pageants? I shall explain through the myths that are presented against us frequently.\nI have never once felt objectified. Yes, there are male judges, but I get worried when there are not any male judges. Men and women see things very differently, which balances the opinion of beauty.\u00a0A\u00a0national queen is supposed to be the great all around woman, someone for everyone to look up to. Each judge looks for a special something.\nYes I have strutted my stuff on a runway in my bikini. I can see how people would find that weird;\u00a0I found it daunting at first. But nothing compares to that feeling of applause when you do go out there, empowered, and finally feeling good about yourself. I was often criticised for my body, now people were applauding it.\nFurthermore, it is not all about vanity. There is a compulsory round of charity and each contestant must raise money for a charity that they want to give a voice to. I ran half marathons, got myself out of bed to do car boot sales.\u00a0If I didn\u2019t do pageants I\u2019d probably be sat on the sofa watching Netflix, but this gave me the drive and motivation to actually do something, and give a voice to those who without my support, wouldn\u2019t be heard.\nWouldn\u2019t you like to have a role model for your daughters who promotes charity, healthy living and empowerment?\nWe\u2019ve all seen Miss Congeniality: that fatal question when she says her ideal date would be 25\u00a0April. No one actually sees it but there\u2019s an interview round behind the scenes where the judges test the contestants\u2019 general knowledge.\u00a0I have failed several times and I\u2019m studying towards a degree. Interviews are always daunting and especially onstage. If you\u2019re good enough to reach the top ten you are asked a random question onstage \u2013 with the world watching you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOne particular night, a gang of feminists started pelting eggs at us, screaming that we did absolutely nothing but thought we were pretty and held women back. As an egg hit my leg I couldn\u2019t help but feel let down. All of my hard work with raising thousands for charity and helping victims of domestic violence find their voice and courage with my words was crashing around me.\nAs more eggs were hurled, another girl took my hand in solidarity. I had been ridiculed by girls most of my life: pageants were the only place that every girl surrounding me helped with a dress that needed pinning or a hair disaster. A great sense of community surrounds it;\u00a0in competition we do get a bit heated but when a girl has won we celebrate together.\nWith pageants I had finally reached that point, after years of being told I wasn\u2019t much to look at by fellow women, to feeling proud to be myself and strong.\nIt started with a thought and ended with a bottom line: women having the ability to choose what they want to do. That\u2019s feminism, right there.\u00a0\u00a0", "I hate the Eurovision Song Contest. Not like I hate poverty, or global hunger or Noel Edmonds, obviously. But I hate it all the same.\nI hate the blatant corruption of the voting \u2013 not bribes (though I\u2019d not be surprised) but the petty geo-political games countries play when awarding each other marks. So, even in a year when a tuneful entry from Greece would be carrying substantial support everywhere from Portugal to Finland, Turkey, its ancient adversary, could always be relied upon to give it sod all votes, as if by doing so they were avenging the Treaty of Sevres.\nBy the same token, Greece (and Cyprus for that matter) rarely give the Turks much of a break. Much the same could be said of other old animosities \u2013 Serbia and Croatia, Poland and Russia (post Cold War), even Britain and Ireland during the Troubles.\nAnd the \u201cmusic\u201d isn\u2019t even that. It\u2019s just a sort of rubbish international talent show. Or lack of talent show.\nIt would be much better if the various nations got their best bands or singers to do the gig. Instead we end up with the most eccentric and unmusical bunch of clowns the continent has to offer.\nMost of all, though, I hate the whole Eurovision \u201cthing\u201d. It may be unkind in the circumstances, but I never thought Terry Wogan's commentaries \u2013 \u201clook at the funny foreigners\u201d \u2013 were all that amusing. He relied rather uncomfortably on dubious national stereotypes.\nA lot of the \u201cironic fans\u201d of the Eurovision Song Contest are, in my view, close to racist, sat there with a six pack of Stella and a bag of Doritos laughing at Albanians because, well, Albanians are intrinsically funny, aren\u2019t they? Even the mafia, the people smugglers and the drug dealers.\nThe winning Eurovision song ought to be something like: \u201cI\u2019m Albanian and I want you to laugh at me, and then vote for me\u201d.\nPositively awful.", "The revelation that Facebook have been censoring news stories they don\u2019t agree with is seriously worrying. \u00a0A seventh of the world\u2019s population use Facebook, which means over a billion people are exposed to the sort of Lefty liberalism the social network seems to like. A wise man once said \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d, but Facebook obviously dislikes this axiom, preferring instead to throw it in the bin along with free speech.\nOf course the left\u00a0will be ecstatic, lauding Facebook for weeding out all the bigots and hatemongers, from moderate right-wingers to neo-Nazis. They\u2019ll praise the company for making their website a \u201csafe space\u201d before demanding they implement a trigger-warning system to protect their infantilised hordes from the real world.\nUnfortunately this sort of censoriousness seems to be in vogue and encapsulated by no-platform policies across universities worldwide. Unsurprisingly, alongside Facebook, Twitter now polices their feeds in deference to this new insidious zeitgeist. Nick Pickles, Twitter\u2019s UK Head of Policy, has said that the web has helped to make \u201cchallenging, even upsetting viewpoints\u2026 more visible\u201d in a way that is \u201cnot always comfortable\u201d. Twitter, once describing itself as \u2018the free-speech wing of the free speech party\u2019, now acquiesces to the demands of a mollycoddled generation of politically-correct online crusaders. Like fragile flowers they collapse at the merest hint of a contrary argument.\nEven Angela Merkel\u2019s in on it. The German Chancellor was overheard last September asking Mark Zuckerberg what he could do to counteract offensive posts about the refugee crisis. In February the Facebook bigwig joyfully announced that Facebook were to clamp down on xenophobic posts.\u00a0 The doctrine of censorship is spreading, even to the highest of governmental levels.\nLike the residents of a\nThey fail to see, for instance, that freedom of speech has this amazing mechanism in which the most universally condemned of viewpoints just go away. If they\u2019re unpopular that means no one\u2019s going to listen, and if no one is listening they will fade into obscurity. \u00a0It also has another essential function: the right to criticise. Facebook et al misunderstand this as the right to censor, probably because they haven\u2019t got any good arguments. Angela Merkel does though. She has a good, humanitarian reason for opening Germany\u2019s borders. Pandering to the puerile yelps of lily-livered liberals by censoring Facebook posts, however, seems a desperate step back. \u00a0\nMark Zuckerberg has under his control the most influential medium in the entire world and is misusing it. Zuckerberg is an amiable kind of fellow, the kind of person you\u2019d love to have a coffee with, but his brash disregard for right-wing views is insulting and disrespectful and his penchant for draconian censorship illustrates that even the most innovative and forward thinking of people can be afflicted with the liberal delusion. Like natural selection, reprehensible views, if they are universally regarded as being so, will largely disappear, so censorship is not needed.\nThe real danger is when Facebook include moderate right-wing views in their purge, views shared by a lot of good, decent people. Lumping these people in with white supremacists, homophobes, and racists not only fundamentally misunderstands their views but displays a level of ignorance similar to real extremists. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "Ask me for my nationality and I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m a European. No Brexiteer, I. But there are times when I do wonder if the EU doesn\u2019t cosy up too much to some very unsavoury folk.\u00a0\nIn my archives, I have tens of thousands of pages of notes, clippings, documents and reports from the Middle East over 40 years. Some of those files also cover the Bosnian war. I have in front of me a dispatch I wrote 18 years ago, when I was in the Kosovo capital of Pristina \u2013 still part of old Serbia, still controlled by the thugs of the Serbian paramilitary police, and already partially controlled by the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army.\nDown from the Serbian capital of Belgrade on 18 June 1998 comes this rather suave, dangerous young man \u2013 I unkindly referred to \u201chis baby face, thick lips and quick smile\u201d \u2013 who tries to persuade us journalists that all dictator Slobodan Milosevic wants in Kosovo is peace, dialogue and human rights for everyone, including the 90 per cent Muslim Kosovar Albanian population. Not a word of Serbia\u2019s suppression of Kosovo\u2019s autonomy nine years earlier.\nGiven that he was Milosovic\u2019s information minister, and not long before that the spokesman for Vojeslav Seselj, leader of the Serbian militia which ethnically cleansed much of Bosnia and who said that his men had graduated to \u201crusty shoehorns\u201d in putting out Croat eyes, we didn\u2019t expect this dapper gent in his smart blue blazer with shiny buttons to say much about ethnic cleansing.\u00a0\nWas the minister aware, I asked him, that large areas of Kosovo were under the control of armed Albanian separatists?\n\u201cThis is good justification for the presence of [Serbian] government forces on this territory,\u201d he replied. And there was no reason to use comparisons with Bosnia and \u2013 here we all held our breath \u2013 with \u201cthe vocabulary of the situation in Srebrenica.\u201d\nAh yes, the problem of \u2018vocabulary\u2019 \u2013 words like massacre, rape, pillage, the worst European war crime since 1945. That word \u201csituation\u201d came from Vucic\u2019s lips, a craven, pusillanimous expression for the execution of more than 8,000 Muslims into mass graves that followed the 1995 surrender of the UN \u2018safe haven\u2019 of Srebrenica to the Serb murderers.\nThe \u201cvocabulary of the situation in Srebrenica\u201d: here was the Serbian minister, less than three years after the slaughter, palming us off with this Blairite expression while lecturing us on civic duty, constitutional rights, patriotism and non-violence.\u00a0\nWhen he mentioned Srebrenica, without the slightest emotion in the midst of his creamy propaganda, it was like finding a splinter of glass in a piece of chocolate, a little horror buried away amid the soft undergrowth of words.\nSo why should we be surprised \u2013 again, less than three years after this chilling press conference in Pristina \u2013 to find the same tall, rather gangling but smart young man accompanying the monstrous Vojislav Seselj (under a veil of secrecy and in the company of Iraqi security agents) to Baghdad as a guest of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Ba\u2019ath party?\nSeselj held a long meeting with Saddam \u2013 Iraq was at the time crushed by ten years of crippling sanctions which were imposed following Iraq\u2019s 1990 invasion of Kuwait \u2013 after landing at Damascus airport in Syria and being escorted by both Syrian and Iraqi escorts to the border post at Wadi Ash Shalan for the overland journey to Baghdad.\nBut now I must introduce you to this ambitious chap whose boss was housed in one of Saddam\u2019s guest villas and who joined the Iraqi dictator in a joint condemnation of American aggression. Yes, the former Milosovic minister of information \u2013 who knew very well that Saddam had sent telegrams of mutual support to Milosovic at the height of the 1999\u00a0Kosovo war when the Serbs, under NATO air attack, were driving 200,000 Muslims out of Kosovo \u2013 is none other than the present-day Prime Minister of Serbia.\nThat man is Aleksander Vucic, who wants to take Serbia into the EU and is thus loved by our EU mates in Brussels and who is now advised by \u2013 no drawing in of breath here, please \u2013 Tony Blair.\u00a0 And since Blair has now \u2018advised\u2019 the dictator of Uzbekistan and more recently the Egyptian coup leader, Brigadier General President al-Sissi, Vucic is in good company.\nA safe pair of hands, then, greeted warmly these days in Downing Street and Brussels; not just a prodigal son, but a man whose decision to accept a compromise UN resolution on Kosovo \u2013acknowledging a World Court ruling that Kosovo\u2019s independence declaration was legal \u2013 was embraced by our Brussels elite as a \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d. All of which will accelerate Belgrade\u2019s request for membership of the EU. Blessed are the Peacemakers.\nVucic, of course, is doing all the right things. He now runs the Serbian Progressive Party, is heartily loathed by his old friend Seselj \u2013 who was cleared of war crimes in Bosnia after eight years of imprisonment at The Hague \u2013 and even turned up at the Srebrenica memorial service last year, where Bill Clinton rashly urged mourners to shake him by the hand.\nVucic laid flowers at the cemetery. The Bosnian Muslims, however, had longer memories than the smoothies from the EU. They recalled a Vucic speech from the Bosnian war years \u2013 \u201cFor every Serb killed, we will kill 100 Muslims\u201d \u2013 and they pelted him with stones and bottles.\nOnly a few days earlier, the wretched Vucic had urged Russia to block a UN resolution that would have condemned the Srebrenica massacre as genocide, an act which the EU had typically ignored, but which made Bosnian Muslims very angry.\u00a0 Thumbing through my old notes from 1998, of course, it all makes a lot of sense.\nIt was the same old problem: Vucic\u2019s difficulty, despite the flowers, was all about \u201cthe vocabulary of the situation in Srebrenica\u201d. Massacre, yes; genocide, no.\u00a0\nNot to worry. Lord Blair himself \u2013 the guy who bombed Serbia for its \u2018cleansing\u2019 of the Muslims of Kosovo \u2013 is on hand to smooth the path to greatness of Aleksander Vucic as he leads his nation into the comity of European nations.

He\u2019s about to become the first incumbent president to visit Hiroshima.\nOn May 27, immediately on the side lines of a G-7 summit, Obama will travel to the city where the US became the first, and thus far only, country to use a nuclear weapon in anger. And, despite (or perhaps because of) the post-war alliance between the two nations, you can see why no occupant of the Oval Office has yet ventured to Hiroshima.\nMore than 70 years after the explosion of the uranium fission atomic bomb, code-named\u00a0Little Boy,\u00a0killed 100,000 people or more, America\u2019s use of the bomb to end the deadliest war in history is as controversial as ever. An unnecessary savagery inflicted on civilians, as many Japanese and some American revisionist historians believe, and on a country that was about to surrender anyway? Or, as the standard US narrative has it, just desserts for a country that had unleashed brutal imperial aggression across Asia\u00a0and the unprovoked sneak attack on Pearl Harbour that led to America\u2019s entry into World War II?\nWhat is certain is that few presidents would have turned down the chance offered to Harry Truman:\u00a0to end, at a single stroke, a war that otherwise might have culminated in a land invasion of Japan costing, his generals estimated, a quarter of a million American lives.\nIncredibly, Hiroshima may not have been the single most destructive US air raid in the war: the distinction may belong to the fire-bombing of Tokyo five months earlier, on the night of March 9/10 1945, which incinerated some of the most densely populated areas of the Japanese capital. That horrific event however is virtually forgotten.\nNot so Hiroshima, and the divisions it arouses.\nThis columnist well remembers the metaphorical firestorm when in 1995 the Smithsonian\u2019s Air and Space Museum here in Washington sought to mark Hiroshima\u2019s 50\nThe original design included a section on the bombing as seen from a Japanese perspective, with the implicit\u00a0suggestion that it may not have been quite the nobly pure manifestation of US most Americans believed it to be. The result was furious protest by veterans groups and uproar in the then Republican-controlled Congress. The exhibit was amended, but the Museum\u2019s director was forced to resign. Into this minefield now steps Obama.\n\u00a0An American president is going to a place where the American military killed 100,000 people, virtually all of them civilians. Yet the one thing he can\u2019t do is apologise. And as the White House made clear when it announced the trip:\u00a0he won\u2019t. In fact Obama would be best advised not to\u00a0make a speech in Hiroshima at all. Rather, keep the occasion personal, low key and reflective, focussed not so much on the past, as on the need to make sure a nuclear weapon is never used again.\nAny public show of contrition in Hiroshima would feed straight back into the tempestuous election campaign back home. Republicans would see it as another stop on the Obama \u201capology tour\u201d, of saying sorry for bad things the US has done, from slavery to the 1953 coup in Iran and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. An apology, moreover, would merely bolster arguments that the US is a weakling and a sucker that everyone takes to the cleaners (see Donald Trump, passim.) And to be fair, even the Japanese don\u2019t seem to be expecting one.\nEven if Obama doesn\u2019t say a word however, the symbolic contradictions will be jarring enough. This of course is the president, who in Prague seven years ago\u00a0made a speech calling for a nuclear-free world, that may have earned himself an absurdly premature Nobel Peace Prize. And it\u2019s also the president who last year defied the hawks by striking a deal to slow \u2013 if not halt \u2013 Iran\u2019s progress towards a nuclear weapon.\nBut he\u2019s also the president who's overseeing a 30\u00a0year, $1trillion\u00a0programme to update America\u2019s already colossal nuclear arsenal with bombs carrying smaller payloads. And smaller bombs mean \u2013 yes \u2013 more usable bombs.\nMeanwhile, hovering nearby (but out of sight, one hopes) on Hiroshima\u2019s hallowed ground, will be the presidential aide carrying the nuclear \u201cfootball\u201d (more accurately a black leather briefcase) containing launch codes for a US nuclear strike. And the man leading Obama on this pilgrimage? None other than Shinzo Abe, the conservative prime minister who is loosening the constraints imposed by Japan\u2019s post-war pacifist constitution and, critics say, re-stoking the fires of Japanese militarism that led to the calamity of 70 years ago. Contradictions? Some might say a better word is hypocrisy.\nAnd regardless of\u00a0the White House's insistence\u00a0that there will be no apology, the President\u2019s own itinerary could well create exactly that impression. It\u2019s hard to imagine Obama going out of his way to visit Hiroshima without making a stop at the Memorial Museum, with its harrowing images and relics from the August 1945 apocalypse, or meeting some of those who survived it. Either way, the image will be reinforced of Japan as victim, not aggressor.\nBut Obama and his advisers have surely weighed the risks, and concluded that however delicate, a visit to Hiroshima will strengthen, not weaken, the US alliance with Japan. And if it does cause a fuss, then one suspects this president will not be too bothered. In conventional parlance he may be a lame duck, but his approval ratings are climbing by the week. He\u2019s plainly savouring these last months in office, and doing what he thinks is right. The prison visit, Cuba, and now Hiroshima all prove it.\u00a0"], "sport/football/premier-league": ["The roar from the crowd split the air like forked lightning and into the fading light, out came the ghosts. There, striding out beside Mark Noble, there was Bobby Moore, the ball tucked under his arm, gazing up at the old chicken run, crossing the touchline and breaking into a jog.\nThere, pointing his finger and dishing out fierce instructions to Cheikhou Kouyate, there was Billy Bonds, his socks already round his ankles, mud up his legs and hair round his face.\nAnd there, swinging their arms and rocking their hips, Dimitri Payet and Frank McAvennie, having a laugh about something or other, wondering which of the two it might be who\u2019d set the night alight with a flash of languid magic.\nThe stands were full of ghosts too. Dads and grandads, brothers, mothers. There for one last look at that lime green oblong shining in the dusk, alive with a hundred years of fraught desires, spread out against the sky one final time before the bulldozers come.\nMost West Ham fans will happily indulge the cockney creation myth. The pie and mash and jellied eels and pearly kings and queens, though it bears scant relation to the lives they lead.\nThe memories they made one last pilgrimage to honour are of the wonders of sport, more than the mundanities of life.\nOf Alan Devonshire, dancing up the middle of the pitch as if the world around him had been switched into slow motion. Of Phil Parkes leaping suddenly sideways, tipping a wicked shot on to the bar.\nOf a Julian Dicks penalty erupting like a meteorite. Carlos Tevez, shirt off, bounding into the crowd. And that immortal flash of sinewy Italian thigh, suspended in midair, lashing the ball towards the far corner and landing on his feet in a world gone mad.\nThey were made to wait. Anger, hope, disappointment, joy, despair and every other human emotion that\u2019s been trodden in with the chips and horse shit down Green Street since 1904 was getting raked up from lunchtime, the ground softened by a steady rain of lager from plastic pint pots.\nWhen the West Ham coach arrived at the corner of Barking Road it saw a throng of thousands, crowded at the foot of the Legends statue, Moore not just on the shoulders of Hurst and Peters, but of everyone. It took the coach twenty minutes to get the 200 yards down Green Street,\u00a0Noble waving all the while from behind the dark glass, young Bangladeshi women leaning out of windows above newsagents, taking pictures on their phones.\nIt took the Manchester United coach even longer, and while it waited it was pelted with bottles, smashing the tinted windows. Kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes. Not every hangover from football's night before is worth the nostalgia.\nIn the moment before kick-off, Upton Park was as loud as it\u2019s been in 25 years. Not even a brass band playing \nThey chanted Ludek Miklosko\u2019s name on kick off, then Di Canio\u2019s, then with ten minutes gone, Aaron Cresswell intercepted a poor clearance, Diafra Sakho had fired the ball in to the bottom corner, and the great goodbye was on.\nMany are wondering why Upton Park has been eulogised in this way. It\u2019s not like this story hasn\u2019t been told before. In those hallowed places where terraced houses give way to rising floodlights once stood Roker Park, Filbert Street, the Baseball Ground. Many still do stand, Selhurst Park for one, Vicarage Road. That West Ham looms so large in English football culture is the bittersweet burden of disappointment.\nManchester United should have won a World Cup. So should Liverpool. Barcelona has, Bayern Munich has twice, Juventus three times. Ajax have made it to two finals. Little old West Ham eh?\nThe ghosts were made flesh at the end. Fireworks and flamethrowers went off, the disco lights were switched on and they drove them on to the pitch in claret and blue hackney carriages. Martin Peters. Alan Devonshire. Ludek Miklosko. Steve Potts. Sir Trevor Brooking. Billy Bonds. They put Paolo di Canio under a spotlight on the mark where he hit that volley.\nOff we go then, to face football\u2019s bright new future, with its taxpayer funded corner flags and \u2018world class corporate hospitality right on the doorstep of Canary Wharf.\u2019\u00a0\n\u2018Bigger ground.\u2019 \u2018Grow the club.\u2019 \u2018The next level.\u2019 These are the buzzwords to cling on to, as you try not to notice that the behemoth that is Villa Park, and quite possibly St James\u2019s Park too are about to exit the Premier League, Bournemouth are doing fine and Leicester City are champions.\nTry to forget the words of Slaven Bilic, from only Monday. Our new home \u2018will never be a fortress.\u2019 Will never be \u2018hostile.\u2019 Here, as David de Gea celebrated his team\u2019s equaliser, bottles landed in his area. Terrible behaviour, but good luck trying it in the Olympic Stadium.\nThe players came out too in the end. Mark Noble thanked the staff, like good East End boys do.\u00a0It was approaching midnight by the time the crowds turned their backs and went home.\nOnly the ghosts remain, waiting for the bulldozers. You can join them if you like. If you've got a few hundred grand for an unaffordable starter home in a lost bit of London, you might catch Tony Cottee doing your ironing, Paolo Di Canio watching your pasta as it boils, McAvennie sniffing round the drinks cabinet.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s it. Fortune no longer hiding. It\u2019s 1.6 miles away in Stratford. It\u2019s got Europe\u2019s largest TV screens and a \u00a3200m roof. We had a laugh looking for it though didn't we.\nThe record books will show you Winston Reid headed the winner. That West Ham took the lead then came from 2-1 down to win 3-2. But already there\u2019s 30,000 West Ham fans who will spend the rest of their lives telling you they saw different. That it was Frank Lampard Senior\u00a0that picked up a loose ball with ten minutes gone, and threaded it through not to Sakho but to Tony Cottee, who slipped it quietly past De Gea.\nWith 15 minutes to go, they'll swear they all saw Trevor Brooking hanging in the air at the back post, nodding it home. And then, with ten minutes of life left on the Upton Park clock, that centre half, up for a set piece, shoving his way into half a yard of space?\nNaah. Couldn\u2019t be.\nCould it?", "Even after Danny Welbeck\u2019s injury, the strongest part of Roy Hodgson\u2019s England squad is up front, where he has Jamie Vardy, Harry Kane, Daniel Sturridge and Rooney to call upon. It must help Hodgson, then, that Rooney has been moved back into midfield, where he fulfils a role that could be of use at Euro 2016 next month.\nHere Rooney was back in midfield again, playing alongside Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera.\nHis job was to fire diagonal balls out to the wings and the full-backs who were stretching the play. His first attempted ball flew over Marcos Rojo\u2019s head but he soon found his range and started to find Rojo, Antonio Valencia, Anthony Martial and Juan Mata.\nThey could not do enough with the ball though, and eventually West Ham\u2019s superior power in midfield told against him.\nIn the final minutes Rooney was reduced to complaining at referee Mike Dean as the game slipped away from the away side, knowing that control of their Champions League destiny has gone too.\u00a0\nIt has not been a vintage Manchester United season, not even close, but one achievement Louis van Gaal can point to is having a defence that holds up more often than not. Much of this has been built on the partnership of Chris Smalling and Daley Blind at centre-back, and on Tuesday night Smalling gave another performance that, in parts, should encourage Hodgson to trust him in France.\nWhile West Ham pressed and created chances in the first half, it was Blind who struggled, losing Diafra Sakho for the opening goal, and then Carroll when he should have put West Ham 2-0 up. Smalling looked accomplished when the ball was on the floor, and when challenging with Carroll in the air he won as many as he lost.\nHe crucial interventions kept out two threatening set-pieces from Dimitri Payet in the first half, although he could not stop their second-half resurgence.\nWhen United had the ball Smalling was confident playing it out and starting moves, and overall he looked like an assured defender experienced at the top level.\nHe ought to be the first centre-back on Hodgson\u2019s team-sheet this summer. Whether it is John Stones, Gary Cahill or Phil Jagielka alongside him is up for debate, but Smalling must start.\nCarroll has a helpful habit of bringing his best to the biggest games, and his hat-trick here against Arsenal in April will go down as one of the last great individual performances at Upton Park. But here on the final night he could not produce anything to match. Carroll worked hard, put himself about and, as ever, was dangerous in the air. When West Ham went long Carroll routinely won his headers, even beating Smalling in the air. He had a second-half header cleared off the line.\nBut when the ball was on the ground, Carroll was not good enough to make the difference. So it was when he missed West Ham\u2019s best chance to go 2-0 up, during first half dominance they ought to have made the most of. He looked surprised to be put through on goal by a Daley Blind mistake, but he had far more time than he needed and yet could do little better than hit the ball low straight at David De Gea. It was a bad miss, betraying a lack of confidence and finesse to his play. Which is why Roy Hodgson is still unlikely to take him to France.\nThere were two super-talented French forwards playing here, each stuck out on the left wing. Martial and Dimitri Payet have both enjoyed excellent first seasons in England since arriving from \nThe first was a simple finish at the far post after Martial had peeled away, anticipating Mata\u2019s clever cross from the right. But the second was a wonderful goal, a reminder of why so many see so much of Thierry Henry in the young man signed from Monaco. Martial took the ball on the left, paused then tore past Winston Reid with his blistering pace. As the whole ground waited for him to cross, or cut back inside in, he instead drove a shot to the near post before Darren Randolph could realise what had happened. This is the incisive quality, and natural goal-scorers instinct, that made United\u2019s heavy investment in him last summer make so much sense.\nThere was a moment early in the second half when it felt as if Payet would not be able to make his talent tell on a match of this size, that he would leave the Boleyn Ground without influencing the last match here. During the first half, when West Ham created chance after chance against a sleepy United, he had been played through by Manuel Lanzini only to skew the ball wildly into the away fans, having made what looked like the first technical error of his West Ham career.\nThen, in the second half, West Ham started to win free-kicks in what is now known in east London as \u2018Payet Territory\u2019. But the first one went into the wall, the second into the stands.\u00a0Still, Payet did not worry, instead turning his talents to providing. His whipped set-pieces are always dangerous and so it was here, as he drove the ball hard and low enough to find the heads of his team-mates rather than defenders. First there was his ball in from out wide, after one of his free-kicks had been blocked, which perfectly found Michail Antonio at the far post, to draw West Ham level. Then, in the final minutes, another driven free kick, perfectly judged, which Reid got onto to head home. Even if he does not start for France next month, he is some substitute to bring on.", "Manchester United have seen two league titles slip from their grasp at Upton Park and they can now add blowing Champions League qualification to their West Ham tale of woe after throwing away a 2-1 lead to gift the home crowd the dream finale at the stadium\u2019s last-ever game.\nLeading 2-1 less than 15 minutes to play following two Anthony Martial goals \u2013 the second was a stunner \u2013 United then capitulated, conceding two soft headers to Michael Antonio and Winston Reid to miss the chance to dislodge Manchester City in fourth and go into the final day of the season in pole position for the final Champions League berth.\nUnited must now hope that City lose at Swansea this Sunday, and that they defeat Bournemouth at Old Trafford, for a last-gasp ascent into the top four.\nThis was never going to be an ordinary game, with the lights going out on Upton Park for the final time, but the visit of United to this corner of the East End has always carried more spice than most fixtures for West Ham.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd United have found it to be a graveyard for their ambitions more than once, with Sir Alex Ferguson decrying the \u2018obscene\u2019 effort of an already-relegated West Ham back in 1992 when Kenny Brown\u2019s goal sealed a 1-0 home win and all but ended the visitors\u2019 title hopes.\nSo with United needing a victory again to leapfrog City and climb into the top four, Van Gaal\u2019s would have approached this game with apprehension due to history and the ability of Slaven Bilic\u2019s team to beat anybody on their day.\nBut with emotions running high with Upton Park closing its doors after 112 years, United\u2019s players also had to overcome the trauma of their team bus being attacked on the approach to the stadium ahead of the game.\nFive windows were smashes, with glass showering the players, prompting the idiotic response by West ham co-chairman David Sullivan, suggesting that United \u2018should have got here at 4pm, and that \u2018if you check the coach, there won\u2019t be any damage to it.\u2019\nSullivan may have turned a blind eye to the thuggery of a section of his club\u2019s supporters, but video footage offered clear evidence of the attack. If this is the Upton Park experience, then it should be goodbye and good riddance.\nBut with the game eventually kicking off at 8.30pm following a 45-minute delay, United endured another ambush, this time on the pitch, with West Ham starting in a frenzy of noise.\nBilic\u2019s team went for United from the off and they were ahead on ten minutes when Diafra Sakho\u2019s left foot strike from Manuel Lanzini\u2019s cross deflected off the shin of Daley Blind to beat goalkeeper David de Gea.\nUnited were shellshocked, missing the calm assurance in midfield of former Hammer, Michael Carrick, and they should fallen further behind ten minutes later when Andy Carroll, clean through on goal, was denied by De Gea\u2019s legs.\nVan Gaal\u2019s team, needing a victory to have any realistic hope of Champions League qualification, could not get a foothold in the game, with 34 minutes passing before Wayne Rooney\u2019s cross was headed to safety by Michail Antonio.\nUnited could not afford to play their usual patient game, however, with a victory crucial for their top four aspirations and Van Gaal, so often the arch pragmatist, replaced the ineffective Morgan Schneiderlin with Carrick at the interval.\nAnd the change was rewarded six minutes into the second-half when Martial levelled for United after a Marcus Rashford inspired counter attack left West Ham exposed.\nRashford, hugely impressive for an 18-year-old just three months into his first-team career, broke towards goal before feeding the overlapping Juan Mata, who continued into the penalty area.\nMata then a delivered a low ball to the far post, leaving Martial the simple task of stoking the ball into the net.\nWest Ham responded well, though. Dimitri Payet flashed a 20 yard effort into the side-netting before the Frenchman\u2019s 56th minute free-kick was somehow headed over by Sakho from three yards.\nMartial then headed off the line from Carroll as West Ham hit back, but the stadium fell silent on 72 minutes when the United forward danced into the penalty area before beating goalkeeper Darren Randolph from a tight angle.\nGame over? United may have thought so, but West Ham drove forward, with Antonio equalising with a header from Payet\u2019s 76th minute free-kick.\nAnd the killer blow for United \u2013 and perfect ending for Upton Park \u2013 came when Reid stooped to head Payet\u2019s cross past De Gea five minutes later.\nUnited had the top four in their grasp, but they can only blame themselves for throwing it away.", "A video has been uploaded to Twitter showing how the Manchester United players reacted during the incident on the way to Upton Park this evening, when their bottles and cans were thrown in the direction of their bus in ugly scenes.\nThe match was delayed by 45 minutes because of the incident, as the coach arrived at the ground ahead of the final fixture at the ground.\nA number of players including Jesse Lingard, Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, England internationals Michael Carrick and Phil Jones and Belgium international Adnan Januzaj are visible in the video.\nWayne Rooney said the United bus \u201cgot smashed up\u201d as he arrived at Upton Park before the delayed kick-off.\u00a0\n\"It wasn't nice.

Kick-off was delayed then by half an hour, for a match that Louis van Gaal's side lost 3-0.\nThe club's next match after that defeat was, ironically, an FA Cup match at Upton Park, with the Hammers' social media team quick to make light of the delay days earlier.\u00a0\nWest Ham's last weekend match at the venue, against Swansea last Saturday, ended in a 4-1 home defeat.\u00a0", "Jurgen Klopp believes his Liverpool side are on the right track as they enter the final week of his first season in charge at Anfield.\nThe club host Chelsea on Wednesday in their final home match of a campaign that has included a run to the \nA league trip to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday precedes next Wednesday's meeting with Spanish side Sevilla in Switzerland, a win in which would see the Reds qualify for a Champions League place next season.\n\u201cEveryone can see the good signs and we will build on it,\u201d the German, who replaced Brendan Rodgers in October, said.\n\u201cWe have to improve and I am sure we will.

Nobody banged on about the financial worth back then.\u00a0Instinctively you knew relegation was a bad thing and it meant failure and you did not need people talking of \u00a3100 million as a ginormous financial carrot.\nSunderland\u2019s fans didn\u2019t want their team going down and nor did their players. One of them was Sam Allardyce, who\u00a0by his own admission\u00a0did not set Roker Park alight in a brief spell in the North East.\nAllardyce moved to Sunderland when he was 25 for \u00a3300-a-week, quadrupling the salary he was earning at Bolton. It sounds more than 35 years ago, given that the most important player at Sunderland in 2016, Jermain Defoe, currently picks up around \u00a380,000 for the same seven days\u2019 work.\nNot that Allardyce will begrudge the centre-forward. He was one of the few jewels at the club when he took over back in November from Dick Advocaat, who believed he could not save the club with the personnel and felt promises over new players had been broken.\nIn 1981, Allardyce asked the club to help him buy a home in the North East because he was fed up of commuting from Bolton. The then chairman Tom Cowie refused. Allardyce handed in a transfer request and the manager at the time, Ken Knighton, who was leading Sunderland into the second tier of English football, was sacked.\nUnhappy players, managerial sackings, relegation fights, it is a cycle of decline that has been sinking Sunderland long before the Premier League rolled into town.\u00a0\nAllardyce has more power in his armoury than when he was merely a player, but now, as in 1981, the significance of the final two games is huge. On Saturday, April 25 of that year, Sunderland played Brighton at Roker Park. Brighton were also fighting relegation, starting the day two points behind their hosts (two points being the reward for a victory back then).\n\u00a0\nBrighton won, which meant Sunderland had to go to Anfield on the final day of the season needing a result to stay up. If Everton, Wednesday night's\u00a0opponents, do not lose, history will repeat itself in the enormous significance of the final day of the season.\nSunderland this time head to Watford on Sunday\u00a0and if Everton go one better and win on Wednesday night, as Brighton did that day all those years ago, they will need a victory to guarantee league survival, as they did at the start of the 80s. That it is Newcastle they are fighting against\u00a0(Norwich having slipped to outsiders) merely adds to the drama. If Sunderland do not beat Everton at the Stadium of Light, the North East will head back into real meltdown for four days.\u00a0\nIt is the cold light of day to the delirium of Saturday, when a late fightback saw off Chelsea and the often absent owner Ellis Short was spotted in the home dressing room at the Stadium of Light in celebration.\nFor Allardyce, a man who has favoured positions for the ball to be on the pitch (POMO 1 and POMO 2),\u00a0the likelihood of believing the work has been done is a non-starter.\u00a0\n\u201cI cast my mind back to when I played here and the last thing I want to happen is the same thing that happened to me,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat did we have to do with two games to go? We only had to draw with Brighton to stay up. We lost in the last minute.\u201d\nThat was when Gary Williams struck with a left foot volley at the Fulwell End.\u00a0\u201cWe went from two games to go needing one point, to one game needing three points,\u201d he added. \u201cLuckily, good old Stan Cummins scored the winner at Liverpool away, but we don\u2019t want to put ourselves in that situation tomorrow.\n\u201cChelsea was one of those results that everyone looked at and thought how have they done that?\u00a0It is the dream scenario. It is something that you strive for. We all have to try to help the players grasp it while they\u2019ve got the chance and not let it slip. It\u2019s one more big commitment, one more big performance. Then we can all sleep a little easier after that.\n\u201cPersonally, I feel it's still big, big pressure and we have to handle that. We have two games left to secure Premier League status and knowing we can do it in one game and kill everyone else off is pressure in itself.\u00a0I can't see anything but a reaction from Roberto Martinez's players after the criticism they received following their defeat at Leicester.\n\u201cI\u2019ll know in the first five or 10 minutes whether [my players]\u00a0allow the size of the game to cause them any problems. A\u00a0win will get us safe, there\u2019s no greater pressure...\u00a0other than having to\u00a0win the last game of the season to stay up.\u201d\nThe Sunderland manager knows all about that. He was on the bench that day at Anfield, as he will be at Watford. Thirty five years on, Allardyce, who will remain at the club if they retain their Premier League status, will not want to go through the experience again.", "West Ham face Manchester United tonight in their final ever game at the Boleyn Ground, ending 112 years at their iconic home before they move to the Olympic Stadium this summer.\nBut the game has massive consequences for the visitors too - should United win this one, and their last match of the season against Bournemouth at Old Trafford, they will be guaranteed Champions League qualification.\nDavid Gold has warned that West Ham's Upton Park farewell could be scrapped if fans invade the pitch.\nThe Hammers have arranged a lavish closing ceremony to mark their final game at the Boleyn Ground, against Manchester United on Tuesday night, before their move to the Olympic Stadium next season.\nAround 450 former players have been invited to the match, although the club have kept their precise plans for the occasion under wraps.\nAnd joint-chairman Gold is urging supporters not to ruin their big night by running onto the pitch after the final whistle.\n\"It's very important. You want this all to go smoothly,\" he said. \"It can only get delayed, or dare I say it possibly even cancelled, if there's a pitch invasion.\n\"I urge fans to keep an eye, particularly on the youngsters, to make sure they don't invade the pitch.\n\"This is a momentous moment in the history of the football club. It's important to the football club that we say farewell.\n\"We're going to have arguably the whole football world watching this event, so don't spoil it chaps. It's so important.\"", "It did not take long for the jokes to start on social media as Manuel Pellegrini delivered his farewell speech as \nThere were the usual gags about there being nothing unusual about the unoccupied blue seats, prompting \nPellegrini\u2019s address to the crowd, which preceded one of the most half-hearted \u2018laps of appreciation\u2019 you are ever likely to witness, was the definition of apathy.\nThe City supporters, nine-tenths of whom scarpered as the boos rang out at the final whistle of the 2-2 draw with Arsenal, could not be bothered, the players seemingly could not be bothered and Pellegrini, who had been given the opportunity to forego the chance to say goodbye, appeared to regard the whole episode as akin to thanking his colleagues for a \u00a350 voucher for the garden centre handed over to mark his departure.\nFor some supporters, the regular sight of just a small handful of players acknowledging the City contingent at the end of away games was reason enough for them to head to the pub rather than applaud those who had repeatedly snubbed them.\nIt was a joyless quarter of an hour, not helped by the absence of the Capital One Cup on the squad\u2019s end of season lap of honour, but perhaps that was another example of the identity crisis which City are now suffering and which could yet prove an unexpected issue for Pep Guardiola to address when he arrives from Bayern Munich in July.\nHaving waited 35 years to win a trophy until the drought broke with the 2011 FA Cup, is the Capital One Cup now no longer important enough for City to show off to their supporters?\nWhatever the explanation \u2013 City fans can view the trophy in the club shop should they wish to do so \u2013 it does not reflect well on a club, which even those who work for it now believe has lost its heart and soul.\nOne long-serving employee remarked, following the Champions League semi-final defeat against Real Madrid, that City has now become a \u2018club full of twats\u2019 \u2013 a reference to those slick and trendy bright young things who now walk through the reception area of the City Football Academy as though extras on The West Wing, dashing from one meeting to another, regarding the Manchester City brand as nothing more than an impressive addition to their CV.\nAsk them their views on Pablo Zabaleta, and you would hope they would speak glowingly of the Argentine defender\u2019s qualities on and off the pitch, rather than confuse him for a celebrity chef.\nThose with City at their core regard many of the new faces as simply passing through.\nThere is little warmth for chief executive Ferran Soriano, the former Barcelona director, who lacks the personal touch of his predecessor Garry Cook and there is a sense that, from Soriano, through to Pellegrini and a good number of his players, City is just a stopping off point en route to something else.\nSeveral of the star players require regular persuasion to attend off-field events, be they media or community commitments, with the view that too much is asked of the likes of Joe Hart, Kevin De Bruyne and Zabaleta, who will say \u2018yes\u2019 when some of their team-mates have remembered a last minute appointment or apparent airport dash to collect a family member.\nThey say attitude reflects leadership, so Pellegrini\u2019s approach of doing the bare minimum of what is required contractually appears to have seeped into the dressing-room and, judging by recent performances and results, it has gone beyond merely saying \u2018no\u2019 to a request for thirty minutes of the players\u2019 time.\nPellegrini\u2019s prickly demeanour, combined with Soriano\u2019s cold approach, has also done little to generate a sense of the collective at City and, again, Guardiola has a job on his hands to rebuild morale on and off the pitch when he arrives.\nCity possess none of the \u2018band of brothers\u2019 mentality that has driven Leicester City to the title and it is difficult to envisage the players standing among the club\u2019s supporters at a game, as the likes of Phil Jones, Michael Carrick and Marcos Rojo have done this season across town when not available to play for United.\nThe fans have noticed, and felt, the disconnect, which explains the mass walk-out at the end of the Arsenal game.\nIan Cheeseman, BBC Radio Manchester\u2019s long-standing City reporter, asked Pellegrini directly at his pre-match press conference last week whether he and his players actually cared whether the club could finish the job of securing a top four finish and Champions League qualification over the final two games of the season.\nPellegrini\u2019s response was typically diplomatic, while not really answering the question, insisting only that it was \u2018very important to finish in the best way.\u2019\nIt was a response which lacked any kind of emotion or conviction, just another example of saying or doing the bare minimum.\nThere has been too much of that at City and not enough heart.\nGuardiola needs to find a way to make everybody care again at the Etihad if he really is the man to take City the highest level.\nJohn Terry will never win a popularity contest outside of Stamford Bridge and, in many respects, for good reason thanks to the non-footballing issues which have tarnished his reputation.\nBut if the former England captain is to be judged purely on his achievements as a footballer, the glee which greeted the dismissal at Sunderland last Saturday, which means he will not enjoy a final farewell for Chelsea this weekend, was over the top and lacking an appreciation of his qualities as a defender.\nTerry has been the best English defender for the past decade and, love him or loathe him, that should not be overlooked.\nIt has been interesting to witness the lengthy build-up to West Ham\u2019s farewell to Upton Park, with the final cup tie, the final \u2018game under lights,\u2019 the final Saturday game and, finally, the final game at the stadium all being afforded special status.\nJust imagine the fuss if Liverpool or Manchester United were ever to leave Anfield or Old Trafford for pastures new?\nUpton Park will always be iconic for West Ham supporters, but its demise will prove no more significant to fans of other clubs as that of Ayresome Park, Highfield Road or the Baseball Ground.", "If only Norwich had played anything like this all season...\nThe Canaries' demotion back to the Championship was confirmed by Sunderland's victory at home to Everton but at least they gave their supporters a performance that was both bold and brave, albeit against opponents with nothing at stake.\nIf only Norwich had played anything like this all season...\nThe Canaries' Premier League return ended up lasting just a single season as, despite this flurry of goals, Sunderland's comprehensive and simultaneous victory over Everton meant there can be no last-day reprieve, not for them or for Newcastle.\nDieumerci Mbokani scored twice after Nathan Redmond had cancelled out Troy Deeney's early opener for the Hornets, whose own performance had 'end of season' written all over it. Redmond, who also contributed two assists, was electric, although it was Wes Hoolahan who tempted Craig Cathcart into putting through his own goal towards the end of a frantic but mesmerising first half.\nAt that point anything suddenly seemed possible but news of a brace of Sunderland goals changed the picture; the second half, in which Odion Ighalo pulled one back for Watford and Mbokani completed the scoring, meant little and everyone knew it.\nYet the majority of the Norwich fans stayed to applaud their players afterwards and made a point of chanting the name of Alex Neil, the manager who had taken them up and then back down.\n\"That, for me, was really, really humbling,\" the Scot said. \"I feel as if I've let them down. I feel as if we've come up short as a group, as a club. For them to respond in that way, I didn't expect. I think it's really unusual. I can only thank them for that. It makes it even more difficult for me to accept that we've come up short.\"\nNeil, at 34 still something of a managerial rookie, also told his players he felt he owed them an apology. \"I think my decision making at certain times across the season could've been better,\" he admitted. \"Probably in hindsight I could've made better decisions or different decisions.\"\nSome of those were tactical - Norwich attacked with relish in this game yet had not scored a single goal in their previous four matches, all of which were lost. Others centered around player recruitment, a perceived failing that saw chief executive David McNally fall on his sword earlier in the week. Deficiencies in all positions but especially up front and at the back have cost Norwich dearly this term: Mbokani and Redmond, the two top scorers, are not yet approaching double figures.\n\"At the start of the season we needed to strengthen the squad probably more than we did to give the team the best chance to stay in the league,\" Neil added.\nAt other clubs the fans would have long been gone and the board sharpening their knives. Watford, who came up with Norwich, have not once been threatened with relegation and also made it as far as the semi-finals, at Wembley, in the FA Cup. Yet Quique Sanchez Flores, the manager, is expected to be on his way as soon as the season is completed on Sunday.\nIn a season where Leicester are runaway champions little makes sense and Flores has been fielding questions about his imminent demise for a number of weeks now. The Spaniard has a break clause in his contract and knows he will be able to find employment elsewhere with little difficulty.\n\"The contract is very clear,\" he said ahead of a scheduled end-of-season meeting with Watford's owners, the Pozzo family. \"We need to meet, to say what is our feelings. We chose this kind of contract, after one year it is important to share the feelings, if we are happy, if we share the same point of view. It\u2019s time to do that in a few days. It\u2019s time now to reflect, and know exactly. We got the objectives a long time ago.\"\nFlores has the opportunity to say his farewells at Vicarage Road on Sunday when Sunderland are the visitors in a fixture that is now a dead rubber. Norwich travel to Everton, the team whose limp showing at Sunderland confirmed the Canaries relegation.\nNeil knows he and his colleagues have only themselves to blame of course. \"There's been games this season where we were leading and we ultimately cost ourselves points,\" he said. \"There's games where we made crucial errors, where you'd like to think under those circumstances that if anybody's going to beat you they're going to have to work to beat you.\n\"It's always tough to pinpoint one or two games, I think there's a whole host of games over the course of the season where we'll look and think we deserved a bit more. Ultimately you've got to do enough.\n\"Ultimately across the season so far we've made too many errors at crucial times in games, I think we've missed too many opportunities at crucial times in games.\"", "The\u00a0Newcastle United managing director Lee Charnley spoke on Wednesday of his devastation at the club\u2019s relegation, but refused to offer his resignation.\nCharnley, who has overseen the spending of \u00a3120million on 17 players in the last four transfer windows, said there would be a full inquest but did not say he would leave his post.\nNewcastle will now face Tottenham at St James\u2019 Park on Sunday in a game that means nothing for the already doomed home side.\nOwner Mike Ashley, who has now overseen two relegations in his controversial nine-year reign, is unlikely to be at the stadium.\nCharnley is expected to go, and Newcastle could be led by Rafa Benitez for the last time.\nThe Newcastle managing director gave no assurances over Benitez\u2019s future. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager has a break clause with relegation that could allow him to leave.\nCharnley, in a statement to supporters, said: \u201cTonight we are devastated at our relegation from the Premier League, as I know every single person connected to this football club will be.\n\u201cThe process of scrutinising what went wrong and planning for what is to come has already begun.\n\"Right now, of course, Rafa and the team must prepare for the final game of the season but after that, please rest assured we will communicate more fully with supporters.\n\u201cI want to pay particular thanks for the incredible backing you have given to Rafa and the team during the latter part of the season.\n\"Nothing more could be asked of you and I am truly sorry we have not given you the outcome you deserve.\n\u201dI also want to thank every single member of staff here. This club is their livelihood, but they are fans too. \u00a0\n\"To go through the threat of relegation last season and then to suffer a worse fate this time around has been very hard for them.\n\"I know that each and every one of them has done whatever they could to help us out of the situation we now find ourselves in.\u201d\nSunderland scored three goals either side of half-time against a hapless Everton through Patrick van Aanholt and two from Lamine Kone.\nFormer Newcastle captain and manager Alan Shearer tweeted: \u201cYou can\u2019t pretend it hadn\u2019t been coming. @nufc not learned from the lessons of 2009.\u201d", "Since knocking out Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals, Bob Marley\u2019s \nEach time it is played on Anfield\u2019s public address system, it informs supporters, of course, that \u201cevery little thing, gonna be alright,\u201d and then the majority of those present join in.\nMaybe their season ultimately will be. Again here, Liverpool eked out a recovery when all indications pointed towards defeat.\nThis time next week Liverpool might be a Champions League club once again and this match will be forgotten about.\nFor that to happen, though, they will have to play a lot better than they did against a Chelsea team that contained John Obi Mikel as a makeshift central defender.\nNever before has the Nigerian midfielder appeared so comfortable in a Premier League fixture on Merseyside.\nEverything that Liverpool have been in games on this ground over the last month, they were not here. Chelsea, decimated by absentees, were seconds away from victory.\nLiverpool\u2019s push for an equaliser had been gentle rather than forceful.\nChelsea\u2019s lead could have been greater had Pedro released a more convincing finish from Eden Hazard\u2019s perfect defence splitting pass with a few minutes to go.\nGuus Hiddink, the acting Chelsea manager, claimed his players had almost executed \u201cthe perfect match\u201d and he was right.\nHe then conceded that Chelsea\u2019s only failure was to kill the game off and he was right about that too.\nIn injury time, indeed, just as it seemed as though J\u00fcrgen Klopp might spend the next few days concerned about momentum being lost with a European final looming, Christian Benteke capitalised on Asmir Begovi\u0107\u2019s mistake from Sheyi Ojo\u2019s cross to steal a point.\nKlopp believes Liverpool\u2019s never-say-die attitude is a great strength. But he realises as well that not everybody trusts the quality of his team yet and that includes fans and, maybe, the players themselves. \u201cYou could say we were patient because we scored right at the end,\u201d he suggested. \u201cBut before we wanted to be patient and everybody ran faster instead.\u201d\nThere was more riding on this for Liverpool than there was for Chelsea, who would finish in their lowest league position in 20 years regardless of the result here.\nTheirs was a skeleton side, with John Terry suspended, Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 and Diego Costa injured\u00a0and Thibaut Courtois sitting in the directors\u2019 box because of sickness.\nLiverpool\u2019s team, meanwhile, reflected Klopp's likely selection policy in next week\u2019s Europa League final against Sevilla, with the same XI that started against Villarreal last Thursday in the semi-final featuring again.\nThere was no sense that this was a full scale-drill, however. It would be tempting to describe Hazard\u2019s opener as a thing of beauty. The identity of the architect did not come as a surprise.\nThroughout, neither Emre Can nor James Milner were able to regulate the Belgian\u2019s movement from a central position and his display was the outstanding feature of the night.\u00a0\nHazard's goal came from Chelsea\u2019s left: slaloming, skipping and accelerating past four opponents before easing a shot past Simon Mignolet from the edge of the box.\nYet at no point did a home player apply necessary pressure to prevent the run and it reinforced the idea that Liverpool were preoccupied by other challenges.\nTheir best opportunity of the first half came when Daniel Sturridge released Roberto Firmino with a delightful pass.\nFrom there, the Brazilian\u2019s first, second, third and fourth touches were good.\nThe fifth ruined any chance of him scoring and the moment acted as another reflection of the way Liverpool were playing.\nThe pattern did not change a great deal in the second half.\u00a0\nThis was Klopp\u2019s 50th game in charge of Liverpool. That it came just 217 days since his appointment last October meant that he had reached the landmark quicker than any Liverpool manager in history.\nHaving played so much, especially since Christmas, it seemed as though it might have been up to Klopp to determine whether this performance was a consequence of diverted attentions and players being afraid to commit to the high intensity levels that he usually demands in case of injury ahead of a big game, or, in fact whether Liverpool are getting tired at exactly the wrong time.\u00a0\nPerhaps Benteke\u2019s intervention will stop that investigation happening. Perhaps Klopp will be happy to ride the momentum from here.", "In the end it was easy. There were no nerves or fears, no drama. By the time the third goal had come for Sam Allardyce\u2019s Sunderland - before the hour mark had even be reached - Wearside reached for their cigars.\nFrom then it was a party.\u00a0\nIn case anyone 13 miles away was unaware of what was happening at the Stadium of Light, the full repertoire of songs against Newcastle United came out.\nIt is Newcastle who will fret about a manager, about their precious balance sheets and the lack of credibility that goes with relegation.\nThis was Sunderland\u2019s fourth great escape in the past four seasons, but undoubtedly the sweetest. Victory guaranteed their safety and their rival\u2019s demotion.\nIt will be Allardyce - sacked by the Newcastle owner Mike Ashley of course - and Sunderland who take the biggest pot of television money in the history of the game to build a football club and the delirium inside the stadium told you that.\u00a0\nAllardyce waved happily when the supporters sang his name. Each tackle was cheered, each header met with approval. At the death, when it mattered, Sunderland found the answer.\u00a0\nThree goals in a 17-minute burst either side of half-time blew Everton and their under pressure manager away.\nIt is Roberto Martinez who will now fear for his future. He was given no help by Joel Robles, who was culpable for the first goal, direct from a free-kick from Patrick Van Aanholt and the third, scored by Lamine Kone, his second of the night, when the goalkeeper parried the ball into his path.\nThe charge to stay in the Premier League had come at the end of the first half. Then, for a four minute burst the power of Sunderland\u2019s style and desire simply brushed Everton aside.\nFor 20 minutes Martinez\u2019s side had typically dominated possession of the ball. During that period Allardyce sat in his seat in the home dugout and chewed chumming gum. He looked a man in a pub waiting for his mates.\nIn Younes Kabul and Lamine Kone he had the muscle to fight Romelu Lukaku and in\u00a0front Jan Kirchhoff hurried Ross Barkley and dispirited him. That was important. Much rests on the England midfielder\u2019s creativity. It was stifled and once Allardyce\u2019s Sunderland make their platform they start looking to find holes.\nEverton\u2019s over elaboration at the back gave the crowd hope and similarly, as in the victory against Manchester United in February, Sunderland targeted the young full back, who on this occasion was Matthew Pennington.\nIt was just past the halfway point in the first half when Kabul, confident enough that the threat the visitors posed was being neutralised went on a marauding run down Pennington\u2019s side of the pitch.\nThe former Tottenham central defender could not be stopped and he curled a vicious right footed shot narrowly wide of Joel Robles\u2019 near post. It stirred the crowd, a reminder of just how much rested on victory. The same player had tested Robles with a header from a Wahbi Khazri corner.\nIt was a sign, however, that Everton were running out of ideas and the home side were territorially advancing. In the 38th minute the lead they so cherished would come after a foul on Jermain Defoe in a dangerous.\nThe free-kick from Patrick Van Aanholt would still need an element of the calamitous defending that looks likely to cost Martinez his job. Van Aanholt shot down the middle of the goal, Ramiro Funes Mori jumped out of the way and Robles for some reason went left. The ball went straight into the Everton goal.\nThe keeper went some redeeming himself, however, soon after, when he finger tipped a fine Defoe header over the Everton crossbar.\nWithin four minutes of the first, however, the crucial second goal had arrived. This time there was nothing Robles could have done after Yann M\u2019Vila headed an attempted Everton clearance back into the heart of the Everton penalty area and form eight yards Kone, played onside by James McCarthy, smashed in his side\u2019s second.\nA third was absolutely inevitable. In the 49th minute a Khazri corner should have been headed in by Kone but the ball bounced off his shoulder. Then in the 55th minute came a Defoe lob that Pennington had to scramble back onto his goalie to scramble clear.\nIt did not matter, from the following corner, Robles needlessly parried the ball into his six yard area. There were six Everton players there but not had marked and Kone looked around him in disbelief as he crashed in the third.\u00a0\nSunderland\u2019s safety was assured.\nThere would be chances for a fourth.

I want to be clear \u2013 their behaviour was completely unacceptable and does not represent our club or our values.\n\u201cWhen I was asked about the incident prior to yesterday\u2019s game, I was unaware of the damage that had occurred to the Manchester United team bus. I want to apologise to Manchester United for that damage and assure them that we will be doing all we can to track down those responsible and ban them for life.\u201d\nBoth West Ham and Sullivan have confirmed that action is already being taken to find those guilty of throwing bottles and missiles at the United bus as it attempted to make its way to the ground, with Metropolitan Police also investigating the incident.\n\u201cThis morning I have already tasked my senior team to work with the police to identify them as their behaviour belongs in the past and not in a future that promises so much for our great club,\u201d Sullivan added.\n\u201cI truly hope that in due course we will look back on what happened in the stadium rather than what happened outside and remember our farewell to the Boleyn for all the right reasons.\u201d\nBoth West Ham and United have already been contacted by the Football Association who will liaise with the Metropolitan Police, and the governing body will support any action or bans handed out by West Ham to those found to have been involved in throwing objects at the coach.\nThe FA will also seek to investigate whether the arrangement for United\u2019s coach to travel to the ground in a safe and secure manner were of an adequate level.\nUnited were forced to travel on a replacement coach back to Stansted Airport after the match due to the damage sustained by their club coach.\nPolice confirmed that no arrests were made during the crowd trouble, but an office and a member of the public were treated for minor injuries.\n\"We are aware that a number of items were thrown towards Manchester United's coach this evening, Tuesday, 10 May,\u201d read a Metropolitan Police statement. \"There have been no arrests.

Yes, West Ham play some fantastic football, but when they get into good areas to cross they have excellent delivery, whether from Dimitri Payet or Aaron Cresswell. And Manchester United are a team who are always going to concede a lot of crosses, especially when they play Juan Mata out on the right, as they did last night. Their full-backs were never given enough protection. Before the game I thought that United\u2019s ability to defend the wide areas would decide the game, and so it was.\nWest Ham targeted Daley Blind last night, knowing that they could exploit his lack of height. So it proved, as they scored three goals from crosses, although the first was a cut-back. Smalling challenged well in the air, but at 5 foot 11, Blind cannot do the same. Winston Reid got ahead of him far too easily for West Ham\u2019s later winner.\nWhen I watch Blind, I think he is very good on the ball, very clever and very good at reading situations. But I think he is better suited to play as a sweeper in a back three. Because when teams target him, he is in trouble. It has nothing to do with his ability, and everything to do with his size. All the ability that he has is not going to give him an extra foot in height.\u00a0\nThat is why I think United need a specialist centre-back to partner Chris Smalling next season. All the top teams have two specialist centre-backs playing together: look at Wes Morgan and Robert Huth or Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld. All four of those are imposing tall centre-backs, comfortable at heading away crosses.

Frank de Boer, whose departure from Ajax was announced on Thursday after his agent said at the weekend he would \u201clove to join a club like Everton\u201d is the current front runner.\nBenitez feels that Everton\u2019s supporters may not set their faces against his appointment and considers the Everton job to be a fine opportunity for whoever takes it, with a very strong group of players in Ross Barkley, Romelu Lukaku and James McCarthy who are ready-made contenders for European football. But he knows there is sensitivity attached, owing to the rivalry which existed between him and David Moyes when the two were Merseyside managers between 2004 and 2010.\nIt is the Newcastle post which Benitez is now giving deep consideration to. He is thought to be 50:50 about whether to heed the pleas of the relegated club\u2019s fans and continue at the helm. His predicament demonstrates the profound effect on him that the Newcastle-supporting public on Tyneside has had. Benitez was initially minded to exercise a break clause and leave St James Park if the club did not stay up: a view he still held a month ago.\nEver since his appointment, Newcastle have been urging Benitez to stay regardless of the outcome of the relegation fight. But he will need assurances that the club are willing to invest in players with the skills to mount a Championship promotion campaign, if he is to stay. Benitez is under no illusions about the size of the task ahead, with a reworking of the squad necessary. He knows that many of the players currently at his disposal not suited to a Championship campaign.\nThe relative proximity of Newcastle of Benitez\u2019s family, who he has been seeing once a week compared with their intermittent spells together during his three years spent managing Napoli and Real Madrid, is a major consideration. Other job recent offers have come from Turkey and China.\nDespite Newcastle\u2019s relegation, Benitez\u2019s reputation has been enhanced by his two months on Tyneside where, after turning the side around, he has seen the side go undefeated in the last five games. His success as a Champions League winning manager has stemmed from a shrewd ability to get the best from players. It has been the same at Newcastle.\nEverton supporters\u2019 mounting frustration with Martinez stems from the sense that their fine group of players is not being put to optimum use. Supporters will remember him describing Everton as \u201ca small club\u201d after the sides had played out a 0-0 draw in February 2007.\nBenitez has since said that the description related to Everton\u2019s lack of ambition in that specific game defending\n\"I wanted to say they were a small team in the way that they were playing - deep, defensively and doing nothing in attack. That was my idea. When you play against a top side you know they will have more possession and they will be in more control and you have to find one or two counterattacks,\u201d he told The Independent in 2011.\nMark Hughes, Ronald Koeman, Manuel Pellegrini \u2013 who is thought to want another Premier League job \u2013 Moyes, as well as de Boer, all feature ahead of Benitez in the odds for the vacant Everton position.\nFans had been planning to protest about Martinez at the club's scheduled Player of the Year dinner in Liverpool last night. Their calls for Martinez's dismissal have now been heard, though the event, at St George\u2019s Hall, was cancelled.\n\u00a0\nBenitez expects Newcastle to conclude their representations to him within a week, with their intentions regarding squad investment the over-riding factor for him. Should they fail to entice him to stay, Hull City boss Steve Bruce is thought to head a shortlist of potential replacements, with his own track-record in Championship promotion with that club. Moyes was also interested in the Newcastle job before Benitez was appointed.", "Raffertys. The name could not be much better. Raffertys is a bar, a proper bar, five minutes up a side street from Newcastle Central Station, the kind of bar where, if you were pushed over, you would move but your feet wouldn\u2019t.\nA group of lads - certainly not guys - with an age range of 19 to 49, a 30 year stretch of \nIt did not feel like a time for optimism for a football club, with relegation staring a city in the face for the second time in seven years under a disliked owner, with the Premier League gravy train now no longer using the city as a port of call.\nIt felt like the latest small death of Tyneside\u2019s football club, but instead one song, as it had throughout the day, offered defiance and the tiniest morsel of hope.\nThe day had been all about Rafa Benitez; his knowledge, his chance of staying, to see out the three-year contract he had surprisingly signed in March, and about his song, a version of La Bamba which has unified the support in a similar way to the Blaydon Races.\nWith each chorus of the song, in that bar, up a side street in Newcastle, the volume went up. People were banging things and there was a mood of defiance.\nIt was five to 11 on Saturday night. Realism told you it was over and that the walls of Newcastle United had once more crumbled.\u00a0\nThere was none of that in that bar though. No mention of Mike Ashley, staring at his second relegation inside seven years, or Lee Charnley, the managing director who fired \u00a3120 million of the club\u2019s hard earned money across Europe on a bunch of misfits who cannot score goals, nor the man who now found them, Graham Carr.\nIt was all about a 56-year-old Spaniard who had been in Tyneside for just eight weeks.\nThere is a race to use the religious metaphor about the North East and football, that the game means so much to the people. It annoys some outside of the area. It is a cliche and there is too much of that in the game, and yet.\nWhen Sam Allardyce had been asked two weeks earlier, about the significance of the game to the people of a region he was working in for the fourth time - player with Sunderland, youth coach with Sunderland, manager with Newcastle and manager with Sunderland - he spoke of a unique feeling for the club that he felt, for all his travels in the game, was only matched by those at West Ham.\nHe used globalisation as part of his argument, of a changing support in London for the big clubs. He said it meant everything to the people in the North East, it was part of their heritage.\nTo Newcastle that has translated, during its successful periods, into the shape of bold figureheads, people who have united a club and moved it onward and carried the great weight of expectation of the support.\nBenitez has done that, to a level few expected after his surprise succession to Steve McClaren. McClaren\u2019s departure was so ignominious that he was forced to take training each day whilst talks with Benitez went on.\u00a0\nHe had become head coach after being sacked at Championship Derby. John Carver, his predecessor, had last served as a full time manager at Toronto FC in 2009. Alan Pardew, the man before him, had been working on the radio after being sacked from\u00a0\nLeague One Southampton.\nBenitez\u2019s last job had been at Real Madrid.\nIt was a u-turn, and the support has rallied to a figurehead.\nThe cloud has been the release clause in the Spaniard\u2019s contract, the end to the three year deal if Newcastle were relegated. Demotion, of the team, was confirmed on Wednesday night, when the Stadium of Light rejoiced at their safety and their rivals\u2019 demise.\nFrom here, if he leaves, Benitez can plot a path back to the top level of Spain. Valencia and the national job are possibilities. In England, Robert Martinez\u2019s sacking opened a door in Merseyside. There remains doubt about Arsene Wenger. Ronald Koeman\u2019s success at Southampton could see him move on.\nThey are gaps you get asked to fill when you have a European Cup and ten other major pieces of silverware on your CV.\nBut there has been a connection between Benitez and Newcastle\u2019s supporters. Allardyce, his one time foe, spoke of the desire to be loved in the immediate aftermath of securing Sunderland\u2019s safety.\n\u00a0\nIt may have an undercurrent of the Life of Brian to those outside of the area, but the messianic status of glorified manager has worked. First Kevin Keegan, who led the club from the Championship to the Premier League summit (as Benitez is now being asked to do), then Sir Bobby Robson, who took Newcastle from the foot of the the top division to the Champions League.\nIt has taken nine years - with brief spells of Alan Shearer and Keegan again - for Newcastle to arrive back at the same place. There has been no reinvention of the wheel from Ashley, or his side kick Charnley. Neither man has altered the DNA of Newcastle as a football club or a city.\nIt needs an inspirational figurehead. It needs someone who is allowed to manage, to choose players, to make big decisions, not to be sneaked in a side door, as McClaren was, for their first day in office.\nNewcastle United needs a big name manager. In Benitez they have one, which is why, right now, they have started the fight to keep him. It began in talks at the clubs trading ground yesterday. It is a fight they cannot lose.", "Manuel Pellegrini has launched a vigorous defence of his record at Manchester City as he prepares to vacate the manager's chair following Sunday's Premier League match at Swansea.\nCity, who will be managed by Pep Guardiola, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach, next season, need to avoid defeat at the Liberty Stadium to guarantee the fourth qualifying spot for the Champions League ahead of rivals Manchester United.\nPellegrini won the title in 2014 as well as two Capital One Cups, but his swansong at the Etihad Stadium, a disappointing 2-2 draw with Arsenal in the wake of a flat European exit against Real Madrid, saw many disenchanted home supporters leave before the Chilean manager's farewell speech on the pitch later, reflecting a downbeat mood among fans that has grown in recent weeks.\nHowever, Pellegrini, enlisting the statistics from his three years in charge, said: \u201cI always think we can do it better, but the important thing is to compare yourself with all the other teams.\n\"If we make a summary of the three seasons I was in charge here, we were the team that had more points. We were the team that had better performances as a manager, we were the team that in the three seasons we always scored the most goals.\n\"The only thing that we couldn't be the best at is our defence, that was Chelsea; they conceded just four fewer goals than our team [111 against 115]. The goal difference is huge between us and all the other teams.\n\u201cDuring the three seasons, the fans always tell me that they enjoy our games. Of course, it's impossible to play all the games well, but I think the amount of goals we scored in the three seasons, I think 50 or 60 more than any other team. So I think that's an entertaining team, and a team that wins titles and one that has progressed in the Champions League.\"\nIn fact, City's 255 goals under Pellegrini's guidance are 40 ahead of Liverpool's 215 total, although City's 230 points over three seasons do outweigh the 22 of Arsenal, with other rivals Chelsea (218), Liverpool (205) and Tottenham (203).\nHow will he want to be remembered? \"As a team that always want to play good football, to always try to score, not just trying to get a result and when you score a goal, the game is finished.\n\u201cIt's about a style, and for me it's important to be the highest-scoring team for three seasons, to be always in the Champions League and to win three titles.

How many?\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so many, so of course if we don\u2019t qualify ourselves, then we haven\u2019t reached our aim. That is true because our aim was to qualify, but we are in the final of the FA Cup and we are in the race in the last match - mathematically, we can qualify ourselves still.\u00a0\n\u201cHow many teams can say that? Not many. Of course you can say Manchester United need to be champions. Yes, I know the expectations are like that but I don\u2019t think that is realistic.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I have said I shall be here, that is my opinion, so the board has to decide if it is like that.

Whilst the teams hovering above the relegation zone can breathe a sigh of relief, there is plenty still to play for in the quest for European football.\nThe Independent have teamed up with daily fantasy football game \nOulala's extensive database of statistics, which comprises of 70 different criteria sourced straight from Opta, offers the perfect platform to pick out the stars you should back to finish the season on a high. \u00a0\nWhilst Manchester City have been doing their best to keep the race for the final Champions League spot alive until the final day, picking up just one point in their previous two league games, \nSouthampton are unbeaten in their last five matches, winning four of those games, and a big part of that has been down to the form of \nOne player who is expected to start at Euro 2016 is ", "Football has changed this season. We used to talk about teams passing the opposition to death, as Spain, Barcelona and their imitators dominated possession and trophies. But now teams are passing themselves to death, ending up sterile in attack and vulnerable on the break.\nThe most impressive two sides this season, Atletico Madrid and Leicester City, have realised this. They have developed a deep-lying counter-attacking game which goes against so much of what we were told for the last few years, and is all the more effective for it.\nNow, at the top level, the game is determined by counter-attacking, both scoring from them and defending against them. Which is why Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger, two great managers at their peaks, must now adapt or risk getting left further behind.\nThere was a time, not very long ago, when people used to talk about possession itself with such reverence and admiration, talking about \u2018the passing carousel\u2019, and how it had opponents \u2018chasing shadows\u2019. Teams would run after the ball for 60 minutes, tire themselves out, before being picked off at the end. That was how games used to go, but it is not any more. The idea of endless possession as \u2018the right way to play\u2019 has been shown up as a myth.\nWhat has changed is that teams are now cleverer when they do not have the ball. There is no point in chasing possession until you are exhausted. The answer is to play compact, in your own half, leaving no space in behind, or in between your lines.\nThat is how Diego Simeone has Atletico Madrid lined up, and after their first press, the rest of the team all drops back into their own half. They are so well drilled in defence that they are almost impossible to play through, which is why they have conceded just 18 goals in 37 La Liga games this season. They are not going to win the title this year \u2013 although they did in 2014 \u2013 but could go one better by winning the Champions League.\nClaudio Ranieri\u2019s Leicester City play in a similar way. They defend narrow and deep, with no space between the lines. By defending in their own half they ensure that they are covering gaps of 10 yards, rather than 20 yards. Defending collectively is easier than defending individually, and they make sure they are never exposed to pace in behind.\nThe real genius of defending this deep, though, is that it makes the side dominating possession more vulnerable to the break. Facing a side camped in their own half, you can only pass sideways, not forwards. So you creep gradually up the pitch, moving further and further out of position, with so much space to attack in behind.\nThat is what happens with Leicester every week. When Atletico knocked Barcelona out of the Champions League, Barca centre-backs Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique were frequently just 15 yards outside Atletico\u2019s box. When they knocked Bayern Munich out in the semi-finals, the crucial away goal came when Antoine Griezmann was played through by Fernando Torres, and was clean through on goal a whole 30 yards out.\nWe always hear when Leicester or Atletico score on the break that the goal was \u2018against the run of play\u2019. But nothing could be further from the truth. These fast breaks are entirely part of the manager\u2019s plans. They are the weapon counter-attacking teams have against possession sides.\nThis is why possession stats have been rendered so useless as a guide to who is on top. When Leicester have less than 50 per cent possession, it is not because the game is going against them. It is going entirely to their plan. This season Leicester drew at Old Trafford with 29 per cent possession, beat Swansea and West Ham with 30 per cent, beat Norwich with 33 per cent, Manchester City with 34 per cent, Liverpool with 36 per cent and Tottenham with 38 per cent.\nAtletico\u2019s numbers are even more extreme. When they beat Bayern Munich 1-0 at home in the semi-finals it was with 26 per cent possession. When they beat Barcelona 2-0 in the quarters, just 22 per cent.\nWhat these numbers show is that possession is no guarantee of success, or even of clean sheets. In fact, endless possession can often lull teams into a false sense of security, as they pass the ball and move up the pitch but leave themselves desperately open on the break.\nThat is what has happened at Everton, a perfect example of a possession team who has been caught out by the changing game. Their approach has been all about pointless passing, forgetting about other sides of the game, not least defending. Opponents set traps for them which Everton walk into every week. That is why they have just five home league wins all season \u2013 only Aston Villa have fewer \u2013 and their best performances have come away from home. It was little surprise that Roberto Martinez lost his job.\nOther Premier League managers will learn the same lessons, especially those who have been overtaken by the fast, hungry counter-attackers of Leicester and Tottenham Hotspur. I am thinking about Arsenal and Manchester United, currently third and fifth in the table, neither manager able to get the most out of their strong squads.\nUnited certainly have fast players in Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard but they do not use that pace on the pitch. The problem is that when United win the ball back, they don\u2019t get up the pitch in three passes \u2013 like Atletico or Leicester \u2013 but six or seven, by which time the opposition have got back into shape.\nIf Van Gaal is to survive at United he must show that he can evolve with the times, even though he would be 65 years old by the start of next season. Ranieri, though, is just two months younger than Van Gaal, and he showed this season how adaptable he is.\u00a0\nThe same questions are relevant to Arsene Wenger, another manager whose career seemed to peak 10 or 15 years ago. His Arsenal sides have not seriously challenged for the Premier League title since then, and if he is not open to a different approach it is hard to see how that will change.\nManchester City, of course, have already found their new coach for next season, Pep Guardiola. He built the great Barcelona team which set the new trend for possession football eight years ago. And yet even he knows that there is far more to the game than just keeping the ball.\n\u201cI loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka,\u201d Guardiola said in his first year at Bayern Munich. \u201cIt is so much rubbish and has no purpose. You have to pass the ball with the clear intention of making it to the opposition\u2019s goal.\u201d\nGuardiola was right. This is the era of the counter-attackers now.

I talk with the people in charge and give them my opinion and, to be fair, Lee Charnley (Newcastle\u2019s managing director) agree. We've talked about changing two or three things and, to be fair, we share the opinion.\n\u201cAfter the game against Tottenham, we will start working to ensure that the conditions are the best to compete. I am talking with Lee Charnley, but I want to be fair, Mike Ashley told him that maybe he could talk with me this week before the game on Wednesday but I said, \u2018Listen, we cannot say too much so I think it is better if we wait and I can talk with you if necessary next week.\u2019\n\u201cMike Ashley is keen to talk and I am really pleased that we can sit down and talk, I don't have any problem with that. The message he is sending is quite positive and Lee was very positive but I wanted to be sure that we could do well against Tottenham and then after that we have some time to talk.\n\u201cI will not lie, I am considering (staying). I am quite happy with everything here. Can we improve things? Can we change some things? Then it will be easier for me to make a decision. Obviously these conversations are with this idea.\n\u201cI am really pleased with the first conversation and really pleased with the people here: the staff, players, directors, everyone here since I came has been fantastic so I cannot say other things. I want to be sure that if everything is fine, it has to be fine for me but also for the club, the fans and everyone.\n\u201cIf I stay it is because I want to win, not because I want to stay here in the Championship for 10 years. That is not my target, my target, if I stay, is one year and five in the Premier league. If I decide to stay it is because I have confidence we can get the job done, for sure.\n\u201cI can see that I can help the club with my experience and making the right decisions to move forward if it is possible. I will make mistakes, like everyone else, but the difference when you are successful is that you make less mistakes than others.\u201d\nBenitez wants to build as strong as team as possible to ensure an immediate return to the Premier League. There will be a major overhaul of the first team squad with big earners like Fabricio Coloccini, Steven Taylor, Papiss Cisse and Cheick Tiote all set to leave.\u00a0\nBenitez, who started last season at Real Madrid, also paid tribute to the reception he has had from Newcastle supporters and the part they have played in his desire to stay.\n\u201cThey have done so much it is difficult for them to do more,\u201d he added. \u201cFlattered is the word. They have been fantastic. Even today they were showing me a video of the fans singing my name like in Liverpool when we won the champions league. You cannot expect more from them.\n\u201cIt is just to make sure we have what we want for the future in terms of a strong team that can compete and promote again.\n\u201cIt is very similar. It was the same song, the same way. It was very good. I was in Liverpool six years so the connection and the feelings are there. My family lives there. I could see the connection. The two cities are very similar.\n\u201cWorking class cities and the passion of the fans and the support of the team. A lot of similarities. It is one of the reason why I decided to come, a big club that needed to maybe wake up.\u201d", "Petr Cech. The Czech was just what we needed \u2013 some stability and class in between the sticks and he inspired confidence in those in front of him. Overcame a tricky opening match to shine in his first few weeks and made up for those mistakes against West Ham with a fine display against Liverpool that set the tone for a superb first season at the Emirates.\nOlivier Giroud (and the lack of goals in general). Yet again we\u2019re more obsessed with tippy-tappy pretty stuff around the box but have struggled to get it into the box and the net. Olivier just isn\u2019t the answer \u2013 how France keep picking him heaven only knows \u2013 and the lack of a competent forward shone through after Christmas in our usual late-season demise (flashes of class from Welbeck notwithstanding).\nThe comprehensive 3-0 win over Man United in early October. The sun was shining, Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil were combining superbly and we smashed Louis van Gaal\u2019s team with room to spare. Just a week after becoming one of only two sides to beat Leicester, everything looked set for a sustained title challenge. And then it unravelled. And then Tottenham happened.\nApart from Cech, it has to be Alex Iwobi. He only played in the latter half of the campaign but displayed such authority and maturity that bodes very well for the future. A classy bright prospect \u2013 where have we heard that before?\nZlatan Ibrahimovic would be nice \u2013 providing Wenger doesn\u2019t ask him to trial first! A presence up front would be great, not an immovable French beanpole or a midfielder who starts so far back as to almost break from defence every time we try and score. The fans also need to lay off Arsene Wenger \u2013 yes we have stalled at times in recent years but you can never forget what he has achieved for the club and a lot of the protests have been nothing less than insulting to the great man.\n\u00a0\nIt seems silly that we'd even have a player of the year, and we don't. There's a case to be made for Jordan Ayew, a player who's scored some fantastic goals and put in more effort than almost all the players around him in a woeful side.\nMicah Richards has been an appalling acquisition. Having been brought in as captain, Richards has been part of the homogenous mass of incompetence and, from the outside at least, offered nothing in the way of the leadership Villa so sorely lacked.\nIt seems a long time ago but there were one or two performances worthy of praise under Remi Garde. They didn't end with three points, though, so they're barely worth a mention. I thought we were okay in the home draw against West Ham United.\nAyew fits the bill here too. Jordan Amavi looked promising before his injury and Jordan Veretout showed flashes, but Richards and Joleon Lescott should be looking at Ayew and feeling ashamed of themselves. Rudy Gestede has fallen short but the lack of goals has been endemic.\nA revolution. A new owner remains the top priority because our club is rotten to the core. A good managerial appointment is a must, too, and on the field the most important find among a much needed rebuild is a striker who can score 25 goals in the Championship.\n\u00a0\nSimon Francis; made the step up to the Premier League with relative ease, played every minute and hardly put a foot wrong. Following a mid season injury crisis he moved across to centre back and excelled. Unbelievable that we picked him up on the cheap from Charlton some of whose fans put him in the category of one of the worst players to have played for them!\nJuan Iturbe; We picked up the Argentinian U20 international in the January window on loan from Roma with an option to buy for \u00a315m. An unbelievable signing for us or so we thought, however he\u2019s made just two substitute appearances with the manager obviously not trusting him to fit into our system.\nThe win at Chelsea was amazing but the performance\u00a0against Manchester Utd was very special. Harry Arter had lost his baby at birth just a few days earlier and the news broke on social media just 10 minutes into the game, the raw emotion both on and off the field was clearly visible and the atmosphere as we hung on to beat Utd will never be forgotten.\u00a0\nJosh King; Having arrived from Blackburn in the summer he struggled at first as he adjusted to an unfamiliar \u2018No 10\u201d role having played the majority of his career on the wing. However, he has gained confidence with his strength and pace frightening a few defences and is an exciting prospect paired alongside a fit Callum Wilson.\u00a0\nNo injuries!\u00a0Ideally, we could do with strengthening through the spine of the team, Boruc has made some great saves but can be a liability, so a new keeper, a strong centre back, and a mobile centre mid, but above all it would be great to see our front men stay injury-free.\n\u00a0\nI would have to say Willian, as he's definitely been the most consistent player in a season when so often many big players didn't turn up. His free-kicks alone were enough to turn up for in the first half of the season, before his more illustrious team-mates bothered to turn up.\u00a0\nDespite his form over the last month - and that goal against Tottenham - it has to be Eden Hazard - although it could have been several others,\u00a0including Fabregas, Matic and Ivanovic, who\u00a0seemed worse as they had been so good the season before.\nWell, will have to say the comeback against\u00a0Spurs this month - we couldn't have them winning the title! -\u00a0\u00a0but that was a great game and team performance -\u00a0the second\u00a0half, anyway - and even Hazard scored a proper goal! Although beating City 5-1 in the Cup and Arsenal 2-0 are close seconds.\nI guess Ruben Loftus-Cheek, although we sadly haven't seen that much of him, but he is a Chelsea boy through and through (from the under 8s) and looks to have huge potential.\nA new thoughtful, quiet Italian manager (like the Tinkerman!), Hazard fired up, Zouma back from injury and John Terry as captain.... The invincibles.......watch out, we're coming back!\n\u00a0\nIt would have been James McArthur had he not had a spell out injured, but for me it is hard to argue with the player that got the club award, Wilfried Zaha. He has returned to the fantastic form that we experienced before his infamous spell at United.\nDifficult one this. If I was to be particularly critical then I would suggest Jason Puncheon and Joel Ward have really not lived up to last season. However, the goalkeeping position has been disappointing particularly Wayne Hennessey who has had the run in the side but made silly errors.\nSo many to choose from - Chelsea and Liverpool away, Southampton at home and Watford in the FA Cup semi-final. If we win the final then that will be the performance of the season but just edging it is the 5-1 demolition of Newcastle at home. Simply a superb all-round performance even after going a goal down. \u00a0\u00a0\nSo close to choose between Yohan Cabaye and Connor Wickham but the striker just edges. Even though he has missed plenty of game time which has been disappointing, in the games he has played has shown to be the striker that fits our formation perfectly. More to do with the promise if he can stay fit what he could achieve for us. \u00a0\nA real focus on fitness and the training regime as the injury list has been the worst I have known it this season. No idea whether it has just been bad luck or something else contributing. Also strengthen the\u00a0depth in the squad and get rid of some fringe players that just will not feature. Goalkpeeper, centre-back and striker are our\u00a0biggest needs.\n\u00a0\nPhil Jagielka.\u00a0Offered some vestiges of the old David Moyes-era resilience, despite the defensive shambles around him. He showed the courage too of an Everton leader of old when playing superbly in the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester United despite a hamstring injury.\u00a0\nRomelu Lukaku.\u00a0Has scored 25 goals but has gone missing since that FA Cup wonder goal against Chelsea and his ensuing declarations about Champions League football. Missed seven good chances \u2013 and a penalty \u2013 in the semi-final against United. Awful, awful attitude. The \u00a313m Oumar Niasse is a joke rather than a letdown.\n2-1 v Man City, Capital One Cup semi-final first leg.\u00a0Everton played well at certain points of many matches but lacked the discipline and organisation to capitalise over 90 minutes. The Capital One Cup win against Manchester City was possibly the nearest thing to a 90-min performance but even then they switched off and conceded a costly goal.\u00a0\nTom Cleverley has showed patches of quality. Ramiro Funes Mori has ability but needs some defensive coaching. The most impressive newcomer was left-back Brendan Galloway whose efforts in the left-back role in the early part of the campaign augur well for the future.\nA manager who will actually work on how to defend would be a step in the right direction. A manager who talks honestly would help too. A big summer lies in store for Farhad Moshiri, the new major shareholder \u2013 Evertonians would like to hear there\u2019s a plan for the future.\n\u00a0\nAsking a Leicester City fan to pick their player of the season is like asking a parent to choose their favourite child. N'Golo Kante and Riyad Mahrez have been revelations but for me it\u2019s Jamie Vardy. He embodies everything our season has been built upon, determination, skill and hard work. ..\nSingling out one individual as a let-down is very tough, the togetherness of the squad was a huge factor and everyone has played their part. Gokhan Inler\u2019s struggle to adapt was initially disappointing but it did open the door to the Kante & Danny Drinkwater combination so who am I to complain?\nThere have been two stand out performances this season, Aston Villa at home when we came back from 2-0 down and the game that made people really sit up and take notice at the Etihad when we blew away Manchester City with an unbelievable team performance.\nDemarai Gray has been brilliant since he joined in January and if Mahrez does get snapped up by Barcelona I am sure Demarai will slot straight in. But without doubt the newcomer of the season has been the midfield mini-driving mole Kante. Class in every department.\nThe speculation has already began, from Charlie Adam to Zlatan Ibrahimovic! I am sure we will be linked with them all. For me, whoever Steve Walsh and his scouting team identify I will be happy. Who am I argue with the team that brought us Kante, Vardy, Mahrez and more...\n\u00a0\nPhilippe Coutinho, with Emre Can a close second. However, the diminutive Brazilian was enjoyed his most consistent season to date. Klopp has made him fitter, with him able to last 90 minutes on a regular basis unlike under Brendan Rodgers. With an array of stand out performances and goals to match - including a belter against Dortmund - Coutinho is fast becoming one of the best talents in the Premier League.\nMamadou Sakho. The Frenchman was enjoying an inspired run in the team with colossal performances against Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund only to test positive for a banned substance. Sakho had the admiration\u00a0of the Kop, was set to captain his national team and looks to have thrown it all away.\nThere's been a few contenders.The 4-1 demolition of Manchester City at the Etihad and the 2-0 victory over United at Anfield were both excellent. However, the comeback against Dortmund to win 4-3 will go down in Anfield folklaw as one of the greatest European nights.\nNathaniel Clyne. The former Southampton man looks a snip at \u00a312million. Defensively solid and underrated going forward, Clyne has produced some superb performances, not least against Dortmund and Manchester United.\nA top class goalkeeper has to be at the top of Klopp's priorities. While Mignolet is capable of making some world class saves, he's too prone to mistakes and lacks a presence.\u00a0The likes of Jack Butland, Joe Hart and Fraser Forster have all been linked but don't be surprised if an unknown German prodigy is snapped up. A top class centre-back is also a must with Sakho looking likely to be sidelined for the foreseeable future. More goals from central midfield are definitely needed and if we can keep Origi, Sturridge and Benteke fit then a striker may not be needed. A lot depends on whether we qualify for the Champions League as to the calibre of player we can attract.\n\u00a0\nUndoubtedly Sergio Augero - a world class finisher, he possess an incredible record of goals for games unrivalled in the Premier League. My\u00a0only worry is his performances against the best clubs in Europe.\nRaheem\u00a0Sterling is a huge letdown based on the fee, although Martin\u00a0Demichelis leads a long list. He is clearly over the hill -\u00a0everything gone all at once ... pace, reading of the game, ability to pass, and stay with a man, it's like an old man believing he still has it on the dance floor .... Tragic.\nSevilla away, one of few times they clicked - even Bony looked like he belonged in the team!\u00a0Sharp in closing down, quick on the counter and lethal In front of goal. a\u00a0real complete team performance, and Manuel tactically aware for once.\nWhile Kelechi Iheanacho has become the first academy graduate to regularly start since Micah Richards, I have my doubts. He is\u00a0very ineffective when starting. The one that makes you dream is Brahim Diaz -\u00a0he will make the\u00a0first-team before 18. I'm convinced he has everything - balance, speed, two-footed, ability to dribble and beat a man and, just as importantly, a great attitude..\nLeicester have proved you need players with the right attitude and the ability to work as a team and not individuals;\u00a0we need leaders and organisers, plus defenders comfortable with the ball, which Pep Guardiola will demand (and\u00a0not one who is controlled by a PS remote, sliding at every tap, and the other scared of the ball!)\n\u00a0\nAlthough De Gea got the club\u2019s official award for the third year running, I think most fans\u2019 votes would go for Anthony Martial this year. His signing came as a surprise to everyone \u2013 largely due to the fee \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t failed to disappoint. If a debut goal against Liverpool wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019s bailed us out all too often this year. It\u2019s a joy to watch the way he glides past defenders.\nBesides the manager? Probably Memphis Depay, merely due to the sheer excitement and expectation following his signing. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t improve under different management though, there\u2019s still plenty to come from him. We haven\u2019t been particularly short of let downs this year though, in almost every area.\nAt 3-2, the result might suggest otherwise, but the victory over Arsenal at Old Trafford was certainly one of the more satisfying results of the season. In the end it might not have quite been as comfortable as perhaps it should have, but the first half an hour in particular - which saw Rashford score twice in just his second game for the club \u2013 was one of the more complete, enjoyable spells of a particularly frustrating season.\nNot even close, Martial runs away with this one. Arriving as a relative unknown on these shores, any expectations we had of him, even at the price paid would have been far exceeded by what he\u2019s achieved this season. The most exciting, dangerous player in our ranks by a mile, which the club must recognise and build a team around him. His FA Cup semi-final winner was without doubt one of the highlights of the season. Notable mention to Marcus Rashford.\nLots! Tuesday night\u2019s defeat to West Ham proved just how inept we are at the back. Daley Blind has been great in spells this year, but unfortunately a centre-back he is not. The team lacks leaders in the centre of the park in both defence and midfield so these would be the main areas of concern. In addition, a real right-winger or right-sided forward could make a huge difference to our attack. Both Mata and Lingard lack the pace to make the position their own.\n\u00a0\nAbsolutely no stand out performer in a season of dross. Andros Townsend at least offered something when he arrived from Spurs in January. Offered a bit of flair and pace, good in possession and scored goals. Will inevitably not fancy the Championship and be sold.\nWhere do we start? A hotly-contested section, but winger Florian Thauvin was particularly hopeless. Signed for \u00a315m from Marseille, Thauvin couldn\u2019t pass, shoot, cross or tackle. Didn\u2019t look like he cared and is one of the worst players I\u2019ve seen at Newcastle. Which is saying something.\nAfter Townsend, Jamaal Lascelles offered some hope for the future. Only given a chance in the latter part of the season, Lascelles looked the part in defence and was open and honest about the attitude of some team-mates. Does beg the question: why wasn\u2019t he in the team much earlier? Should be captain next season.\nOooof. A tough one. I suppose the 6-2 win over Norwich back in October, but even this was far from convincing, particularly in the first half where we lost the lead twice. Georginio Wijnaldum scored four and looked top quality \u2013 shame he disappeared completely when it mattered later in season.\nVery simple. Rafa Benitez. Nearly produced a miracle when he arrived, organised a group of individuals into something resembling a team and was ruthless in selection when needed. Mike Ashley should give him whatever he wants and let him re-shape club top to bottom.\n\u00a0\nJonny Howson picked up the Barry Butler Memorial Trophy after being voted player of the season by supporters, which was testament to his consistency and inspirational midfield play coupled with four goals and four assists.\u00a0The 27-year-old played every game until an injury against Manchester United meant he missed the final three games of the season. Wes Hoolahan and Robbie Brady were also stand-out players.\nSadly, mistakes from our experienced players, especially Sebastien Bassong and John Ruddy, let the Canaries down far too often. The inability to take chances at crucial times also proved costly and the promise of Youssouf Mulumbu failed to materialize, while Graham Dorrans didn\u2019t live up to his reputation.\nBeating Manchester United 2-1 in December not only gave City an historic first-ever win at Old Trafford but injected a huge amount of confidence into the players and fans. Alex Neil got his team selection and tactics spot on the players responded superbly with goals from Alex Tettey and Cameron Jerome. \u00a0\nAlthough Swiss international Timm Klose did not arrive until January his class and contribution were immediately evident. City may struggle to keep hold of him as his is a top-flight centre-half all day long. Full-back Ivo Pinto arrived at the same time and after initially struggling has done better of late.\nNeil should stay and forge a far stronger defence, ideally built around Klose, and get better finishers up front. The Championship could be the perfect platform for some of City\u2019s much-vaunted youngsters to step up, especially those such as twins Jacob and Josh Murphy, Carlton Morris and Harry Toffolo, who have been out on loan getting league experience. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nVirgil van Dijk: The Dutchman had been described by some as a diamond in the rough prior to his arrival \u2013 undoubtedly a talent, but saddled with a misguided habit of banging forward unnecessarily. He has exceeded that appraisal by a country mile. Solid, remarkably mature, and a real threat from set pieces.\u00a0\nJordy Clasie: Another Dutch recruit, but with a rather different outcome this season. Clasie has struggled in the physically demanding Premier League, and has continually been unable to leave his stamp on games. With a full season of experience under his belt now, can he become the passing maestro that was promised last summer?\nSaints 4 Arsenal 0, Boxing Day: With the team low on confidence, and experiencing a typically dreary Christmas period, Saints required something extraordinary. Step up Cuco Martina. The right-back bent the ball with the outside of his boot around a bewildered Laurent Koscielny to give his side the lead, before Shane Long et al terrorised Arsenal further at the back.\nVan Dijk can't win two gongs so... Oriol Romeu: Not much had been made of Romeu when he came through the door, but he has developed as a solid alternative to Victor Wanyama this season. In fact, the Spaniard could and should have played more. Should Wanyama itch for a move to White Hart Lane again this summer, Romeu could well step into the breach.\nA right-back and a substitute 'keeper have to be scrawled on the top of Ronald Koeman's shopping list. Martina and C\u00e9dric Soares have not managed to reach the bar that Nathaniel Clyne set, while Maarten Stekelenburg may not want wish to be number two.\n\u00a0\nMarko Arnautovic. Stoke fans have all recognised his talent over the last three seasons but at times he has been frustrating and inconsistent. This season has seen him regularly show off his undoubted ability aligned with an impressive work rate and a very creditable 12 goals. Special mention too for the outstanding Jack Butland.\nXherdan Shaqiri. It's not that he's had a bad season, at times he has been excellent and scored a couple of superb goals. He came to Stoke with a big reputation as the then record \u00a312m signing to help take us to the 'next level' but has been hampered by niggling injuries and has never managed to get a consistency that we all hoped for. 2016/17 should see that happen.\nManchester City, home, 2-0. It really could have been five or six. A day when it all 'clicked', the movement, the work rate, the sheer joy of watching Stoke move the ball so effortlessly against quality opposition, Arnautovic scoring twice, missing a great chance for three and setting up Shaqiri for a tap in that somehow was missed, with Bojan Krcic and Ibrahim Affelay having excellent games too.\nGianelli Imbula. Stoke's \u00a318m record January signing from Porto. Plenty of pressure on him, unable to speak the language, but even in a dour 3-0 home defeat by Everton in miserable conditions his quality was there to be seen. His recent form has dipped along with the team's, however, his performances at Bournemouth, including a fine long-range goal, and 'running' the game at Chelsea hint at hopefully what is to come. A special mention too for Glen Johnson, until injury curtailed his season.\nIt's no doubt the same for many clubs, a quality out and out goal scorer - and how much do they cost!\u00a0Jon Walters is to be admired, he gives it everything and scores some vital goals, Mame Diouf has had heart breaking personal issues, Joselu has shown the odd glimpses, and we all love Peter Crouch but his days at this level are doubtlessly coming to their conclusion. If Ryan Shawcross can get fully fit we need a regular reliable partner for him and another central midfield player to look to eventually establish himself as a long term option for the ever consistent and excellent Glenn Whelan\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a difficult choice as no player has really been head and shoulders of any other. Gylfi Sigurdsson won the fans' player of the year award at the end of season dinner and so would be my choice. He has scored some crucial, match-winning goals when we needed it!\nWe spent \u00a310m in the summer on Franck Tabanou and Eder and neither player got going under Garry Monk and were shipped out in January when we could get something for them! As a club we can\u2019t afford to waste \u00a310m and yet we did with these 2 duds!\nOur 2-2 draw on the opening day at Stamford Bridge was pretty good and I had hoped for a brilliant season but it went south from there! Going to Man City in Dec and narrowly losing was a good one but beating Arsenal at the Emirates would be my choice!\u00a0\nAndre Ayew has scored goals and so has certainly been our best summer acquisition but he tends to drift in an out of games and hasn\u2019t had any competition for this award! Modou Barrow is pretty new to the first team and excites Swans fans -\u00a0quick, skilful with an eye for goal!\u00a0\nIt will depend on who leaves in the summer but a new centre forward is a must for the summer along with a strong \u2018nothing shall get past me\u2019 type of centre half. A new winger and a busy central midfielder who creates chances would also be high up on our shopping list!\n\u00a0\nWithout a shadow of doubt the player of the season has been the mature yet deadly Jermain\u00a0Defoe. At 33 years old many saw him as a gamble with his advancing years, Yet he has single handily contributed towards Premier League survival with his 15 goals, 11 of those coming in 2016. His goals have now contributed directly to 14 points and without him we would already have been relegated.\nJeremaine Lens. The Netherlands international was a hot prospect at the start of the season following his move from Dynamo Kyiv. It may well have been to do with his falling out with Big Sam and the two weeks wages fine, but for me it was from the moment he picked up his red card against West Ham after scoring to put us in the lead at 2-0 he seemed to just simply fade away and didn\u2019t seem to care. Some poor performances later and limited chances on the field are the reason I chose Mr Lens. Such a promising player at the start of the year.\nSunderland being Sunderland and the way we like leaving things until very late there are a few too many to mention. The 3-0 away win at Norwich was pivotal in our turn around and had we lost that would probably have gone down. The 3-2 home win against Chelsea despite being behind twice was a massive win, great endeavour at turning around the result twice and picking up a massive three points with our arch rivals failing to beat a Villa side who has lost their last 11 on the bounce . However the 3-0 home win to secure survival against Everton and to relegate Norwich and our nearest and dearest Newcastle was huge, Lots of Nerves that night and things could easily have gone wrong. Took lots of guts to go out and win so confidently and secure survival with a game to spare so this is my choice.\nFor me it has to be Yann M\u2019Vila, The Frenchman has only joined on loan for the season and looked a worrying prospect at the start of the campaign when on his debut he was sent-off for head butting an opponent in an under-21 game. Since that hot-headed moment he has showed true grit and determination and has helped to steady what was a sinking ship. Over 82% passing accuracy throughout the course of the season, he really is a class act. Picking passes left, right and centre and creating lots of attacking moves. He has declared massive interest in signing for Sunderland on a permanent basis and I really hope he does.\nMore of the same as we showed towards the end of the year. The January additions of Wahbi Khazri, Jan Kirchhoff and Lamine Kone were truly great buys and have dramatically changed our fortunes. Id like Jeremaine Lens to want to fight for his place and maybe get Big Sam to invest wisely on a few new players. Another striker to support Mr Defoe would be ideal, Maybe worth investing big bucks for someone good for this role. I'd also like to send Duncan Watmore on loan to the Championship to improve his game and\u00a0our loan signings of DeAndre Yedlin and Jann M\u2019Villa should be signed on a permanent basis.\n\u00a0\nToby Alderweireld. We\u2019ve lacked a rock at the heart of the defence for years. Last season we conceded more than relegated Hull and as many as Burnley. Signing Alderwerield has led to us having the best defence of the season. One of the best we\u2019ve had down the Lane.\nNabil Bentaleb. This is a hard one as we have had our best ever PL season. One of the players that hasn\u2019t progressed as we hoped. He has had injuries but even when he hasn\u2019t been injured he hasn\u2019t captured the form of last season.\nStoke away. Not only did we play some unbelievable football, it was a night when pressure was on to close the gap at the top following Leicester\u2019s draw the previous day. Unfortunately since that game we havent performed but that one will always stand out.\nDele Alli. A phenomenal first season in the Premier League, leading to him being crowned young player of the year. He has surpassed all expectations at 20years old. He will be an integral part of the Spurs (hopefully) and England squads for years to come.\nIt is hard to pin-point what we need in the first XI, but we certainly need to improve the squad. We have no adequate replacement for Eric Dier and Mousa Dembele, shown by the fact we have lost five\u00a0games all season and in those five\u00a0games Dembele did not play three\u00a0and made a 15-minute substitute appearance in another. We also need back up/competition for Harry\u00a0Kane.\n\u00a0\nTroy Deeney\u00a0has been magnificent this season. I always believed his sheer bloody-mindedness alone would make him a success at Premier League level but augmenting his energy, determination and magnificent leadership has been no little skill. His striking partnership with Odion Ighalo formed the bedrock of Watford\u2019s survival but unlike many of his team-mates, Deeney\u2019s form has never wavered. Heurelho Gomes in \u00a0second place - consistently excellent.\nJose Manuel Jurado\u2019s high appearance stats this season has surprised \u2013 even bewildered \u2013 many Watford fans. Has shown flashes of attacking talent in a defensive team but without really imposing himself. Big-name (by Watford\u2019s standards) signing Mario Suarez has struggled with the tempo of the Premier League which is a worry for next season.\nThe 3-0 home win over Liverpool in December was the season\u2019s high point. Nathan Ake scored after three minutes and Watford never looked back. Ighalo gave Martin\u00a0Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho a torrid time, Almen Abdi was magnificent in midfield and 3-0 was basically a let-off for Liverpool. An amazing afternoon, but it\u2019s been pretty much downhill ever since.\nEtienne Capoue clearly felt he had something to prove following an unhappy time at Tottenham. He hit the ground running at Watford, and never stopped. While Deeney and Ighalo were getting the goals, Capoue was covering the yards and he has looked a real class act. All that was missing was a goal.\u00a0\nJuan Carlos Paredes and Allan Nyom are out of form, and with the likely return of Ake to his parent club Chelsea, some new full-backs will be a priority. And with \u2018own goal\u2019 our third highest scorer this season, someone other that Ighalo and Deeney with an eye for goal might be useful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJonny Evans, has that bit of extra class, time & character, often played out of position as well as Tony Pulis insists on his four\u00a0centre-halves across the defence policy. Honourable mentions to Darren Fletcher & Craig Dawson. A difficult choice regardless and\u00a0not for the right reasons.\u00a0\nSaido Berahino, without doubt the best striker we have, head got turned by Spurs & was badly advised in taking on the club. Attitude was poor until he realised he was not getting his move but was too late by then for many. Other than that, the manager for his continued negative suffocating tactics\u00a0\nIt sums up our poor season when you are scratching your head at this as well. Away performances such as Liverpool, Leicester & Chelsea were good but yielded no wins so probably Man Utd or Arsenal at home. No coincidence that in all these games we let the hand brake off a little.\nJonathan Leko, given a chance late but showed enough brief promise to hope he can be a star of the future. In a side bereft of pace, flair & creativity he shone. Hopefully he (& others) are given further chances & is not tempted away by reserve-team football for one of the bigger clubs.\u00a0\nWhere to start? An ageing squad needs refreshing all the way through. Proper modern-day full-backs, a midfielder who can break through the lines & a striker who has both pace & power is a minimum requirement. Oh, & a manager who takes the game to the opposition will give everyone a lift\n\u00a0\nDimitri Payet. \u00a311m for this French wizard was an absolute bargain. One of the most technically gifted players I've seen in a West Ham shirt. His presence on the pitch turns us into a completely different team and helps bring out the confidence in others. Nine\u00a0league goals and some of the\u00a0best free kicks I've ever seen. He is a vital piece of our future at The Olympic Stadium. A good European Championships for him and France should hopefully see him repeat last seasons' efforts.\nCarl Jenkinson\u00a0returned on loan after a successful spell the season before. Unfortunately it was a case of 'Jenkyll' and Hyde! His performances against Bournemouth and Tottenham were woeful, in which we conceded 4 goals in each. He also got sent-off in one and was at fault for a number of the goals. He then picked up a season-ending injury, and has been replaced by a winger who has done a much better job.\nWest Ham 3-2 Man Utd. So many to choose from, but our 3-2 win against Man Utd in our last game at the Boleyn showed the belief and character this team has. We have often folded in pressure games in the past, but the way the players believe in Bilic and each other has shown why we have only lost seven\u00a0games this season. At 2-1 down against a Man Utd team gunning for fourth\u00a0we picked ourselves up in the soaking rain and made sure we left our beloved home with the best possible send-off.\nManuel Lanzini. A player who had been on the radar of Bilic for a while, but one that most of us had never seen or heard of. He was thrown in with the youngsters in our 2-1 defeat at Astra Giurgu, and found the net after about four\u00a0minutes! He is another technically-gifted player who can have you on the edge of your seat everytime he gets the ball. Lanzini has scored some cracking goals this season and surely the Argentina national team is the next stop for a player who can be every bit as good as Payet.\nTo simply follow on from this one!\u00a0The style of football, the players we've signed, and a rock-loving genius of a manager...it's all contributed to our best ever season in the Premier League. We simply have to add more quality (Lacazette, Nordtveit and Walcott would all be great) and carry on buying into the way we play football. A new stadium and European competition for next season could mean the sky is the limit, and an exciting future should hopefully carry momentum from this great season into the next one.", "Chelsea 2 Tottenham 2: An absolute cracker of a match that sizzled throughout and how both teams finished with 11 men is a mystery. Eric Dier and Diego Costa barged shoulders as the teams swapped ends before kick-off which set the tone. John Terry put Heung-min Son into the advertising boards at the edge of the pitch in the first minute with a crunching tackle and the match finished with a brawl in the tunnel. The fare inbetween was of\u00a0the roughhouse stuff. But there was also some wonderful football: Kane\u2019s goal was a lovely move and Hazard\u2019s a lovely finish. And of course, so much was riding on it.\nArsenal 1 Crystal Palace 1: A match so typical of the ennui at the Emirates as a pretty Arsenal team failed to put away a poor Palace side and paid the price by conceding a late equaliser. The atmosphere was flat and the apathy towards Arsene Wenger and the team was palpable. How long can this go on?\nN\u2019Golo Kante. The non-stop Leicester City midfielder was the reason the Foxes won the league. Yes, Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez banged in the goals but they wouldn\u2019t have had the ball without the little French midfielder. His ability to read play and win possession was sublime and he rarely went to ground so when he got it, he was in position to give it. He can also beat a man with his speed across the ground and play a pass too.\n(4-2-3-1): De Gea; Bellerin, Morgan, Alderweireld, Rose; Kante, Dier; Mahrez, Alli, Vardy; Kane.\nBournemouth:\u00a0The south coast club were widely expected to disappear back from where they came after winning promotion to the Premier League. In fact, they stayed up comfortably and didn\u2019t get sucked into a relegation battle. They played some lovely football too, true to their manager Eddie Howe\u2019s beliefs, even when they were not winning. They have shown the likes of Newcastle and Aston Villa what team-work and togetherness at a well-run club can achieve.\nEverton:\u00a0Any team with John Stones, Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku down its spine and Gerard Deulofeu and Kevin Mirallas down its flanks should be challenging for the European places at the top end of the Premier League not down in 12th place with 44 points from 37 games. That Roberto Martinez, sacked last week, couldn\u2019t accept that and admit it made matters worse and drove a wedge between him and the Everton fans. The damage was irreparable and a season that promised so much delivered so little joy.\n(4-4-2): Cech: Stones, Mertesacker, Bassong, Kolarov; Walcott, Schweinsteiger, Sissoko, Depay; Falcao, Bony.\nClaudio Ranieri\u2019s press conferences. The Italian has been a joy to watch this season and the way he has conducted himself with good humour and good grace serves as a lesson to others. Yes, Jose, you. The Italian has laughed at himself, downplayed expectations and brought the fun back to the football factory. The dilly ding, dilly dong moment was the cherry on the cake.\nOf course, Ranieri must win this award too: A mention to Mauricio Pochettino who has a built a brilliant team at Tottenham who play some wonderful football. But how can the award not go to the Italian? He has managed expectations brilliantly off the field but on the field has shown the tactical nous to switch styles of play mid-season when his team were conceding too many goals. He also was wise in coping with the loss of Vardy at the end of the season by bringing in Leonardo Ulloa and Jeffrey Schlupp to make sure the team still had pace in it. Wise, canny and a barely believable achievement. Bravo!\u00a0\nDele Alli: The Tottenham midfielder has had an amazing first season in the Premier League that has established him as an England player in time for the Euros. He almost guided his team to the title and is a joy to watch. His performance at Stoke City when he scored twice and ran the show as his side won 4-0 was a particular highlight in a season packed with them for the young Spurs man.\n\u00a0\nChelsea 2 Tottenham 2: The 3-3 draws between Newcastle-Manchester United and Liverpool-Arsenal in January had almost everything, but both lacked the needle and high stakes of Chelsea-Spurs at Stamford Bridge. Having led 2-0, Spurs saw their title hopes die when Eden Hazard, of all people, scored the late equaliser in a pulsating London derby.\nManchester City 0 Dynamo Kiev 0: City had done the hard work in Kiev, comfortably winning the Champions League round of 16 first-leg 3-1, but the lack of any kind of action in the return fixture at the Etihad \u2013 barring another Vincent Kompany injury \u2013 produced one of the dullest stalemates you are ever likely to witness. It was, quite simply, 90 minutes of watching crisp packets blow across the pitch.\nWes Morgan:\u00a0Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez were both worthy winners of the respective Footballer of the Year and PFA Player of the Year awards, but defenders are often overlooked and Leicester City\u2019s incredible title success could not have been achieved without the leadership, drive and reliability of their captain. Morgan was Leicester\u2019s Nemanja Vidic, John Terry and Vincent Kompany rolled into one.\n(4-4-2): De Gea; Walker, Morgan, Huth, Rose; Mahrez, Drinkwater, Kante, Alli; Vardy, Kane.\nJermain Defoe:\u00a0The former England forward looked to be enjoying a brief flourish at the end of an impressive career when he arrived from Toronto to help Sunderland stay up last season, but the 33-year-old has taken his renaissance to another level this season, scoring 18 goals to prove that a goalscorer never loses his instincts.\nRaheem Sterling: The Manchester City winger started brightly enough following his acrimonious \u00a349million transfer from Liverpool last summer, but the 21-year-old ends the campaign as understudy to the hugely inconsistent Jesus Navas. Sterling has now endured back-to-back seasons of mediocrity and, for a player with so much potential, next year has become a crossroads for him under Pep Guardiola.\n(4-4-2): Courtois: Ivanovic, Kompany, Funes Mori, Rojo; Sterling, Schweinsteiger, Hazard, Depay; Benteke, Falcao.\nLouis van Gaal is not quite as stern and dour as his reputation suggests and the Manchester United manager does have a humorous side, but the Dutchman left everyone open-mouthed by throwing himself to the floor to complain about refereeing decisions during the February victory against Arsenal.\nClaudio Ranieri: Both Slaven Bilic and Mauricio Pochettino have gone well beyond expectations at West Ham and Tottenham, while Ronald Koeman has also lifted Southampton to the brink of Europe again. But Ranieri has performed a football miracle by guiding Leicester to the title. Manager of the season? His feats will be remembered in a century.\nMarcus Rashford: Anthony Martial has scored more goals than Rashford in his first season in English football and Dele Alli has performed consistently since his move to Tottenham, but the 18-year-old\u2019s impact at Manchester United has saved the club\u2019s season and perhaps even Louis van Gaal\u2019s job. The youngster has been a revelation, just when United needed one.\n\u00a0\nTottenham 2-2 Arsenal, 5 March:\u00a0When Tottenham were 2-1 up against Arsenal, they were heading to the top of the Premier League. Harry Kane had whipped in an audacious goal and White Hart Lane was rocking. But they let their guard down, Alexis Sanchez equalised, and Leicester slowly pulled away. That was the inexperience that cost Spurs.\nCrystal Palace 0-0 Everton, 13 April:\u00a0The worst quality game was Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle, but that was tense because it effectively relegated Rafael Benitez\u2019s side. The worst spectacle was a goalless draw between Palace and Everton, when neither side had anything to play for and were trying to avoid injuries before their respective FA Cup semi-finals.\nJamie Vardy:\u00a0Sometimes the obvious answer is the right one. Vardy has been the best and most important player on a team that pulled off the most astonishing achievement of the modern era. He has scored 24 Premier League goals, and has set a new record having scored in 11 straight games.\u00a0\n(4-4-2) De Gea; Bellerin, Alderweireld, Van Dijk, Rose; De Bruyne, Kante, Dembele, Mahrez; Vardy, Kane\u00a0\nAfter such a good first full Premier League season, Harry Kane has proven that he is here to stay by going one better this year. Kane followed his 21 league goals last year with 25 so far this season, and his continued development as a powerful all-round line leader. Every team in the country would love to sign him.\nThis season Roberto Martinez had no European football and not many injuries either. Just a squad of hungry talented players in their third year under him. They have as much quality as Tottenham and Leicester. But they will finish the season stuck between Swansea City and Crystal Palace, despite Martinez\u2019s relentless optimisim.\n(4-2-3-1) Courtois;\u00a0Bacuna, Bassong, Lescott, Kolarov; Matic, Toure; Walcott, Niasse, Sterling; Bony\nThere is not enough theatricality from our managers and so Louis Van Gaal\u2019s dramatic dive when United hosted Arsenal was a rare highlight. Frustrated with Alexis Sanchez\u2019s perceived play-acting, he threw himself in front of fourth official Mike Dean, to the hilarity of millions. Bravo.\nClaudio Ranieri:\u00a0It has to be the man who took a team tipped for relegation to the title. Ranieri\u2019s genius was to find a simple effective playing style which suited his squad, and which was different from the other sides in the league. Then when the pressure was on he knew how to protect his players.\nDele Alli: Started the season as a teenager with no Premier League experience and ended it as England\u2019s leading midfielder. He is an aggressive, gifted, athletic goalscorer and looks far more mature than 20.

I just stayed away because it wasn't viable financially.\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t really play for a while, but ended up playing part-time for \u00a3100 or \u00a3150 a week, just to play, at Halifax, Stocksbridge and Hyde.\n\u201cI was with Vards at Halifax and you knew at that stage that he was miles better than anything else at that level.\n\u201cYou never imagined that he would go on to win the title, play for England and be Footballer of the Year, but I remember a pre-season game against Scunthorpe, who were in League One at the time, and he played left wing and tore their right-back to bits.\n\u201cBy the end, the right-back was trying all sorts to stop him, but playing in non-league toughens you up and Jamie knew how to deal with it.\n\u201cHe went to Fleetwood, did well again and he has just gone higher and higher, but I think even he would admit he has gone higher than he ever imagined.\n\u201cWhen I was at Rochdale the second time around, Vards was in the Championship with Leicester and he scored a lot of goals to help them get up.\n\u201cI remember Keith saying to me \u2013 and he may just have been trying to get the best out of me \u2013 that I was better than Vardy because I could play in different positions.\n\u201cBut although I am probably ahead of Jamie at the age of 24, you can\u2019t deny that he has taken himself to a whole new level.\u201d\nHogan insists, however, that Vardy\u2019s grounding in non-league has made him the player that he has become.\n\u201cJamie never gets pushed off the ball or bullied,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he has some of the dark arts, but that has seen him through the lower leagues.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give up and doesn\u2019t get fazed by anything, but I don\u2019t think people realise how strong he is.\n\u201cHe is quick, but like a cross-country runner \u2013 he reminds me of Gareth Bale because they can both run all day long.\n\u201cYou never see him in a game where the moment looks to have got the better of him. It is incredible, but he just never gives up and it is brilliant to see where he has ended up.\u201d\nAfter eighteen months on the sidelines, however, Hogan is aiming to justify the Vardy comparisons with Brentford, who have stood by him during his double injury lay-offs and enabled him to catch the eye of Republic of Ireland assistant manager Keane.\n\u201cBrentford offered me an extra year when I first did my knee, to make up for the year I had lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have looked after me, sent me to Philadelphia twice for treatment and paid for me to go away. I haven\u2019t had to use my own money, so I do feel a big debt to them.\n\u201cSince I came back, I have scored seven in seven appearances, but only started two games in that time.\n\u201cThen there is the Ireland thing, which again is a surprise. Roy Keane was at Huddersfield on Saturday apparently and if Roy Keane rang me up, I couldn\u2019t say no to Roy Keane. He is one of my heroes.\"\nFor now, though, Hogan is content to watch Vardy attempt to inspire England to success in France, but his own story may yet follow a similar path.", "Friday the 13th lived up to its reputation as far as Brighton were concerned. The unforgiving nature of the play-offs was again underlined as they succumbed to a Sheffield Wednesday side who trailed them by 15 points ahead of at the end of the regular season.\nHaving suffered the disappointment of missing out on automatic promotion from the Championship on the final day of the campaign after failing to beat Middlesbrough, Chris Hughton finds himself in a familiar position of having to lift his players ahead of the decisive second leg. After seeing out the last half hour with 10 men when Anthony Knockaert went over on his ankle to become the fourth Brighton player to suffer an injury on the night, a two-goal deficit should perhaps be viewed as something of a moral victory, although it will prove a difficult one to overturn given that no side has ever accomplished such a feat.\nIt took a special goal to give the Owls the advantage, Ross Wallace, on his return from suspension, finding the bottom corner from almost 30 yards at the culmination of a flowing four-man move as first-half stoppage time approached. The Scotland international had already been denied by a fine save from David Stockdale as the hosts recovered from a shaky opening to dominate against numerically weakened opponents.\nThe strain finally told when, with 18 minutes left, Kieran Lee ran onto a Fernando Forestieri pass to find the corner of the net from a dozen yards to give a more accurate reflection of the hosts' dominance. No side has overturned a two-goal first-leg deficit in play-off history at this level and given their mounting injury list, few would expect Brighton to buck the trend.\nThe hosts were fired-up by the perceived injustice of having Forestieri's effort ruled out midway through the first-half as the Argentine-born Italy Under-21 striker found the bottom corner from 15 yards with a route one effort directly from a clearance from goalkeeper Keiren Westwood.\nCelebrations were allowed to continue for several seconds before referee Andre Marriner, after encouragement from the Brighton players, consulted with his assistant Darren Cann. After a lengthy discussion, Forestieri's effort was ruled out, the forward having been adjudged to return from an offside position when it was ruled that his Wednesday strike partner Gary Hooper had failed to get a touch to Westwood's booming clearance. Despite Wednesday's clear frustration, it was the correct decision. \u00a0\nBrighton came close to opening the scoring when Tomer Hemed's header from Jiri Skalak's early corner struck an upright. It proved to be the high point for the visitors, Skalak sending their best opportunity after the break narrowly over from a long-range free-kick with the deficit still a single goal. \u00a0\nHaving already been depleted by suspension, they will need to perform a head count before Monday's re-match after being forced to use all three substitutes inside the first 50 minutes, which worryingly for Hughton included Hemed, who was withdrawn with a hamstring injury. When Knockaert exited on a stretcher soon after, it turned into an exercise in damage limitation, a task they stuck to commendably until Lee broke their resistance with a goal which is likely to prove pivotal to the outcome of the tie when the sides reconvene next week.\nA third goal would have put the tie beyond the visitors, but despite their chances appearing slim, they remain in the contest, albeit only just.", "Derby beat Hull twice in the regular season without conceding a goal, winning 4-0 at the iPro Stadium only last month.\u00a0Yet those results counted for nothing as Steve Bruce's side took a firm grip on this Championship play-off semi-final.\nAfter a season dogged by inconsistency, Bruce hailed a performance in which his team \u201chit the level we are capable of\u201d to leave Derby facing a near-impossible task to reach the Wembley final.\nIn a match with few moments of real quality, Derby produced one of their flattest performances of the season and will travel to Hull for Tuesday's second leg in the knowledge that their promotion ambitions are likely to come to nothing for a third season in a row.\nBeaten by Queen's Park Rangers at Wembley in 2014, Derby led the field at several points last season only to fall away so dramatically that they did not even make the play-offs.\u00a0\nNow they have the weight of play-off history against them: no team has recovered from a two-goal deficit after the first leg of a semi-final, let alone three.\nThere were impressive performances all over the pitch from Hull, for whom the full backs, Moses Odubajo and Andy Robertson, were outstanding going forward, and centre-backs Michael Dawson and Curtis Davies commanding at the back. Jake Livermore worked tirelessly in midfield.\u00a0\nHull went ahead after half an hour when leading scorer Abel Hernandez drilled the ball home from 25 yards following a mistake by Derby's Bradley Johnson.\nLivermore nipped the ball away from defender Jason Shackell and Hernandez showed the kind of sharp finishing that enabled him to score 20 goals during the regular season.\nTheir second goal, five minutes from half-time, was a fluke, a cross from\u00a0Odubajo flying into the net via a huge deflection off the unfortunate Shackell.\nBut given that Derby did not manage a shot on target until nine minutes from the end they could hardly complain that they were unlucky, their failure to test stand-in goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic the biggest indictment of their performance.\nJakupovic, who had appeared in only two Championship matches during the regular season, was called up after regular goalkeeper Allan McGregor cried off with a back injury but a well-drilled and highly disciplined defence made sure he was barely tested.\nThe final blow came in the eighth minute of stoppage time as a lightning Hull breakaway from a Derby corner ended with left back Andy Robertson driving the ball past Scott Carson from the edge of the penalty area to turn a daunting lead into one that is probably unassailable.\n\u201cYou want your big players, the experienced players to turn up for the big games,\u201d Bruce said. \u00a0\u201cWe have players who have played in big games, in the Premier League and they had put in a performance that showed that.\n\u201cWe have to guard against complacency on Tuesday because the reason we have not made the top two is that we have thrown in a curve ball every now and again.\n\u201cIn the game here last month we went behind through a mistake and then Moses [Odubajo]\u00a0gets sent off and we got out backsides kicked.\n\u201cBut today we looked a very good team all over the pitch. If we perform to the level we are capable of, it takes a good team to beat us.\n\u201cAfter what happened here in the league, it was important we stayed disciplined today and defensively as a team I felt we were magnificent.\u00a0For Derby not to create a chance was testament to the way we played.\n\u201cIf they had been able to wedge me in somehow, I could have played in goal today.\u201d\nBruce felt for Derby head coach Darren Wassall, the former central defender who briefly played\u00a0alongside him at Birmingham.\n\u201cIn a big game like today the first goal is hugely important and we've all been there, in big games in front of an expectant crowd, when all of a sudden you can't put one foot in front of the other.\n\u201cBut I would rather say it was the excellence of our side, that they were beaten by a far better team on the day. I don't think there is any disputing that.\u201d\nWassall, who had seen his side lose only two of their last nine regular season matches since Harry Redknapp was appointed as football advisor, admitted the odds are stacked against his team making further progress.\n\u201cWe have to show some character now and on Tuesday night, we're playing for some pride and some character and to show what we're made of,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe've left ourselves with a mountain to climb.

But can you can ease the burden by choosing the right bed for your new arrival and trying to establish a bedtime routine as early as possible. From baskets to bassinets and cots to cribs, baby beds are a booming market and one it can be hard to navigate, but make your choice early and stick with it - there is no right or wrong answer so don't be swayed by the multiple opinions that are on offer.\u00a0\nSome parents choose a simple Moses basket for the early days, and there is no reason not to. You can place the basket on a stand in your bedroom at night time and carry it around the house during the day. A bedside crib or pod that latches on to your own bed is also a good option for the early days as it keeps your newborn close while removing the safety risks associated with it allowing it to sleep in your own bed. It is also a good option for breastfeeding mothers who have undergone surgery during the birth as it allows you to feed the child from the comfort of your bed. Traditional rocking cribs make beautiful nursery pieces as well as offering the soothing rocking action that should help your little one to drift off. But for something more durable \u2013 and that won't need replacing in a few short months \u2013 opt for a convertible cot that can be adapted to meet your child's changing needs.\nAdjustable mattress heights allow your child to grow and still stay safe while optional add-ons can increase the size as your baby becomes a toddler.

Mattress included.\n2. \nThis attractively-shaped oval cot is designed to do exactly what your child will: grow. And while it does come in at the pricier end of the market, the wooden design adapts from a newborn\u2019s crib to a toddler\u2019s cot, then into a junior bed suitable for children as old as 10. So, it should be viewed as an investment. An extension kit (sold separately) increases the size, a wall can be removed for when your little one is big enough to get in and out by themselves and the mattress (sold separately) height is adjustable.\u00a0\n3. \nIf you\u2019re brave enough to assemble your own, Ikea offers a range of affordable, reliable cots. Among them is this traditional shaped cot with a modern-looking light grey finish.

Suitable up to about four years of age, sides and bars can be removed as your child develops and the cot mattress (sold separately) can be set at two different heights.\n7. \nIf two mattress height settings aren\u2019t enough for you, the White Company has a solution: three.

They\u2019d got on so well that she came away with a good, informative article \u2013\u00a0and, rather to my chagrin, a job offer to boot. Liz, who\u2019d arrived via the\u00a0\nWhy so much Forgan back history here, you wonder? Because, for me, amid all the twists, turns and altered trajectories, it mirrors what happened to Channel 4 itself. Nothing, from those first founding days, was quite delivered as expected. \"No sport!\"\u00a0turned out to mean many afternoons spent racing from\u00a0Wincanton, supplemented by the Grand National \u2013 and the Paralympic Games as well. We may talk about sacred missions and excellence, about artistic creativity and intellectual adventure: but the story of Channel 4 is far more of an exploration along a winding, rutted track.\nIt isn\u2019t the vision sketched out in that\u00a0\nNothing about C4 and its burgeoning offspring \u2013 More4, E4, Film4\u00a0and the\u00a0rest \u2013 quite makes sense. But then\u00a0the choice of chief executives and chairs\u00a0doesn\u2019t make much sense either. Michael Grade succeeded Jeremy Isaacs: the bouncing, cheerful jack of all trades at the BBC\u00a0and ITV served his time and saw the once-narrow vision broaden. Michael Jackson, the most feted TV executive of his generation, came next, before somehow disappearing amid canyons of American media. Then there was Mark Thompson, who came and went back to lead the BBC after a short exploratory while; followed by Andy Duncan, who marketed stuff for the corporation and wasn\u2019t really a much of a creative hand at all. So to David Abraham, the smart ex-ad man who whipped up Dave and other reheated channels (and doesn\u2019t mind taking an \u00a3800,000-plus salary if that\u2019s what public service provides).\nIs there any binding link along this passing parade of TV wizards, marketing magicians and simple ad blokes? For a while you might have sensed a BBC testing academy, a chance to show what you could do and explore new ideas before you went on to claim corporation acclaim. Maybe, too, the likes of Lord Attenborough as chair\u00a0staked out a patch of elevated influence. But then came right-wing entrepreneurs and former Treasury mandarins, succeeded today by a onetime travel-trade boss who specialises in selling things (such as\u00a0C4). The Government of the day, through Ofcom nomination, finds it easy to set the mood and the direction while\u00a0crying \u201cLook, no hands\u201d. Independence for C4 is a four-syllable word without great meaning: and, meanwhile, the route back to the BBC appears to have lapsed. Jay Hunt arrived as the creative brain after a very distinguished time at BBC1. In other eras, you\u2019d have expected her to return once the big jobs at Broadcasting House fell vacant. But no: Channel 4, in a way, is more isolated than ever before.\nIt depends on the commissioning structure that defines it. C4 buys what it needs from the indie sector. There\u2019s no single button a director of programmes or departmental supremo can push. You\u2019re dishing up a smorgasbord of this and that. You\u2019re constructing a menu from what\u2019s seasonably available, not deciding what must be done. That automatically makes channel identity difficult going on diffuse.\u00a0\nOf course the crown jewels of C4, liberally feted in polite liberal society, trail prestige and branding in their wake. An hour of news at 7pm with Jon Snow and co is a good deed in a bad world.\u00a0\nThe danger now \u2013\u00a0a danger inherent in semi-demi privatisation with Channel 4 sold to some professional private company bent on turning consistent profits while\u00a0(an HMG condition of sale)\u00a0agreeing to keep the totems of public service in place \u2013\u00a0is not that Snow, Matt Frei and Cathy Newman will be out of a job: they\u2019ll be a protected species, the symbol of continuing devotion to the founding precepts. No: the threat is very different. It\u2019s that the ragbag will be turned upside down; that the channel will become much more ruthlessly targeted, far keener on defining audience segments, far more anxious to hone an identity.\nThink ITV1 or Channel Five. The backroom boys there know what works. They rarely take a chance. If Morse is dead, call Lewis: when Lewis grows too old, summon young Endeavour. What goes around\u00a0\nChannel 4, to be sure, grinds out similar fodder year after year. Buying houses; choosing exotic villas in the sun; renovating either of the above;\u00a0or going to Cornwall after all: you know which channel you\u2019re watching the moment you hit the remote. The long, long Saturdays of nothing happening and nobody trying \u2013 except, perhaps, to win some bargain basement cookery competition \u2013 seem bent on audience repulsion. And yet somewhere amongst the rags at the bottom of the bag you\u2019ll find something unexpected:\u00a0\nOf course C4 could raise more ad money if it really concentrated. Of course the slightly haphazard feeling, the schedule of the good-natured shrug, could be polished into more concentrated life. Of course the actual amount of time and effort spent on political thought and political discussion is pretty derisory \u2013\u00a0one stream of public service nobody seems to get right. And of course \u2013 see the breakthrough that Richard Klein in his time as controller of BBC4 made when he started buying Scandi thrillers and opened up the rich cupboard of European TV drama \u2013 C4 can be a bit slow off the mark as well, launching its own European drama season a little on the late side.\nWe\u2019re not talking crown jewels here. We\u2019re often shambling around in search of a cutting edge. The most irritating experience on TV is stumbling on an old\u00a0\nNothing in TV, as in life, is perfect. Channel 4 often falls very far short of perfection. But it\u2019s absolutely not nurse, with something worse round the corner. It\u2019s a human institution in a digitally\u00a0drowned age. It is always likely to stumble on something wonderful. You couldn\u2019t invent it because, in a sense, nobody did invent it. It is a training school for upwardly mobile TV executives and a refresher course for the jaded. It is a brilliant achievement and a continually missed opportunity. It could be in the vanguard of television\u2019s move to conquer the web \u2013 or it may not notice anything\u2019s happened until far too late.\nThe thesis in the trade is that not even Messrs Osborne or Whittingdale will privatise C4 successfully because the public service requirements will carve away at profit forecasts and desirability. In fact, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a problem: public service can be a few ticks in boxes \u2013 Snow and Frei at 40\u00a0minutes, not 55 \u2013 with much else seeping in around. The real test of survival is more important, and nebulous, than that.\nLook, perversely perhaps, at the programme wealth of the Sky Arts channel. It\u2019s almost what Jeremy Isaacs promised for C4 long, long ago. Not surprising, perhaps: the chairman of Sky Arts is a fantastic old chap called Jeremy Isaacs, and he\u2019s an indefatigable champion of the good and the great. But what do you \u2013 an ordinary Joe, not extraordinary Jeremy \u2013 want to watch over supper on an average evening? A good bit of this and a great bit of that, a game with a laugh, a crude shock or two, and a shrewd slice of human experience: the kind of odd mix no Secretary of State shuffling his papers would prescribe. Only Channel 4 would have been imaginative enough, and free enough, to hire Liz Forgan on first acquaintance. Only C4 would have piled different talents and visions together with such insouciant abandon. Only C4 is shamblingly able to raise two fingers when an oppressive Government comes to call. An alternative definition of public service we all need.\nSo ask the question you\u2019ll never find in one of Noel Edmonds\u2019s boxes: who or what is Channel 4 for?

But you can still feel the car going.\nIn severe cases, cabin crew have been hospitalised and pilots have had to use oxygen supplies, but the passengers are never told what is happening.\nThankfully, the copilot managed to keep everything under control until he woke up minutes later. Had the passengers known that their pilot was unconscious at the helm, it probably wouldn't have gone so smoothly.\nOne pilot on Reddit was inadvertently directed into an ash cloud spewed by Mount Etna and remained in it for 20 minutes before making an emergency descent.\nVolcanic ash is composed of rock and glass particles, and while the jet engines are hot enough to melt the glass, it can resolidify once inside, eroding the blades of the compressor, blocking air flow, and even stalling the engines.\nThe electrostatic charge carried by volcanic ash can also cause an electrical failure, which is an immediate hazard.\nYou can read more about how volcanic ash can affect aircraft on Wired.\nIn 1990, a similar incident happened, except this time the plane's captain got sucked out of the window. His colleagues held onto his ankles while he was firmly pressed against the aircraft for the 20-minute duration of its emergency landing. He lived to tell the tale.\nThe US Navy fight-demonstration squadron, the Blue Angels, demonstrate choreographed skills during the annual Joint Service Open House.\nHe says that if a passenger asks, he's pretty honest about it, but never reveals how close they really were.\nOn a 3 mile straight to the runway, we spot a wall of torrential rain rapidly approaching the field.

Upon exiting the rain, and at about 500 ft, we finally are able to see again, and get another alert for a helicopter right in front of us.\nThe most hectic and terrifying series of events in my entire time in aviation.", "I recently returned from a five-day trip to London with my family. Before booking our flight in March, we'd asked my uncle's travel agent to help us find the best deal. Normally, we'd just go for the economy tickets since they're the most affordable. But since we were taking a red-eye to London, we felt pretty strongly about having seats that turned into beds, which you can get only in business or first class.\nAnd this was the only big trip most of us would be taking this year, so we were willing to spend a bit more.\nThe next day, he sent over a few options. We could fly economy from New York to Heathrow for about $800 per person, premium economy for $1,500, or business class on a big-name airline for about $3,500 each. We didn't even inquire about first class; we knew it would be too pricey.\nBut there was a fourth option: Fly on a boutique all-business-class airline called La Compagnie for $1,490 per person, which beat the premium economy and business-class prices on all other airlines.\nI'll admit, I'd never heard of \nBefore I left, I told some friends and colleagues about the airline. None of them had ever heard of it either, so I decided to document the return trip. Keep scrolling for a glimpse at what it was like to fly La Compagnie:\n\u00a0\nI learned that La Compagnie is a small, independent company that has been around since 2013. The airline only flies to and from London, Paris, and Newark, New Jersey. The catch? It doesn't fly in or out of Heathrow, London's big airport. Instead, it goes in and out of Luton, a smaller airport just north of London.\nIt turns out that this is actually a pro, not a con! Luton was only about an hour from our hotel in the heart of London, and Heathrow would have been 45 minutes, so not much of a difference there. Plus, we learned that checking in, going through security, and navigating the airport with a group of seven people and a baby is much easier at a smaller airport than it is at a big, busy one.\nThe process of checking in and going through security in both airports (Newark and Luton) was better than most airport experiences I've had. Because La Compagnie is a boutique airline with only a few flights a day, very few people are checking in at any time. That meant there was no wait on either end.\nThe ticketing agents were extremely friendly. They explained where the lounges were (which we had complimentary access to) and that La Compagnie had its own security line (which was also empty!). We flew through the check-in and security and had enough time to enjoy the airport lounges.\nAt Newark, La Compagnie passengers are granted access to the Art & Lounge space. It's quiet and comfortable with a nice food and drink selection. At Luton, passengers have access to an executive lounge called Aspire, which is modern and sleek, and offers a large selection of food, snacks, and drinks. Below are some photos of the Aspire lounge at Luton airport.\nDrinks, snacks, and food are complimentary. At the Aspire lounge, however, you have to pay for certain fancy alcoholic beverages. The lounge also offers free Wi-Fi and spa services.\nThe spa offers 20- or 40-minute manicures, facials, and massages, among other relaxing treatments.\nThe lounge serves hot food ...\n... as well as sandwiches, nuts, olives, salads, cookies, cakes, and scones.\nThere is also a room with three \"SnoozePods,\" which through the use of intelligent lights and sounds promote full sleep in a pre-programmed 20-minute cycle before \"gently waking you.\"\nAbout 45 minutes before our scheduled take-off, an Aspire lounge employee announced that it was time for passengers on my flight to begin making their way to the gate. When I got there, I boarded our Boeing 757-200 immediately \u2014 no waiting!\nOn both aircrafts, the all-business-class cabins had 19 rows and 74 seats. Neither of my flights were sold out; there were a few open seats on both.\nWhen I got to my seat I found a bottle of water, a pillow, a blanket, and a travel-care kit, which included earbuds, a toothbrush, socks, Caudalie face moisturizer, a pen, an eye mask, and other goodies.\nEvery seat had a Samsung Galaxy Pro tablet that you could remove from the port. Through these devices, La Compagnie offers TV shows, movies, music, magazines and newspapers, and e-books. The tablets can also be used to view the in-flight menu and other information.\nThe seats are spacious and comfortable. They recline to a 175-degree angle and have a built-in massage feature, which I took full advantage of.\nMy 16-month-old niece enjoyed the recline feature. The seats didn't quite turn into completely flat beds, but they got close enough.\nThe antiallergenic pillows and soft blankets were cozier than I thought they'd be.\nUpon boarding, the flight attendants came around offering champagne with cranberry juice, or just plain cranberry juice. Everything on the plane was complimentary.\nNext they handed out comfortable noise-canceling headphones. Sadly, these had to be returned at the end of the flight, but it was nice to have them for the seven hours we were on board.\nJust after take-off, the flight attendants came around with hot towels.\nOn our return flight, which left London at 5:40 p.m. (London time) and arrived in Newark at 8:00 p.m. (Eastern time), we were served a light first course of tuna, a cheese and fig plate, and some sort of pie around 6:00 p.m. It was all surprisingly delicious.\nAbout an hour later, we were served dinner. Passengers had a choice of chicken in a red wine sauce, or spinach and cheese tortellini served with warm bread. I went with the pasta. It was simple yet flavorful. And the portion sizes were perfect.\nFinally, we were served a course similar to what you'd eat at high tea in London. The flight attendants came around with the \"tea and sweets\" meal \u2014 which included a scone with jam and clotted cream, a macaron, a miniature carrot cake, two finger sandwiches, juice, and tea \u2014 around 9:00 p.m. London time.\nOn our red-eye from Newark to London, we had been served dinner after take-off (fig quiche and goat cheese tart, with potato and bacon soup and dessert), and breakfast (eggs, french toast, and croissants) before landing.\u00a0\nNormally one to be wary of airplane food, I thoroughly enjoyed every meal. Of course I didn't like everything (for instance, the scones were cold and hard \u2014 and after enjoying amazing, warm scones in London, these just didn't compare). But I ate almost everything!\nThroughout the flight, a few baskets filled with candy and chips were left out for passengers to help themselves to.\nThere were three flight attendants on each flight. They were very pleasant and attentive. They didn't disturb passengers with a million unnecessary announcements, but came through the aisle with the drink cart frequently, asking us if we'd like anything.\nI wish La Compagnie flew everywhere, because if it did, it's the only airline I'd ever fly. My experience wasn't perfect (for example, my arm rest of the return flight was broken, so I had to switch seats) but overall, it was one of the best travel experiences I've ever had. And at less that $1,500 per person for a round-trip business-class ticket to London ($1,800 to Paris), the value is incomparable.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "Salaries differ across Europe but a higher pay packet doesn't always come with a better standard of living.\nAccording to Glassdoor's report titled \nGlassdoor's cost of living index takes into account is income versus \"how much money is needed to buy a standard basket of goods and services in different countries, including groceries, restaurants, transportation, utilities, and rent.\"\nBusiness Insider took a look at the 13 cheapest cities to live in Europe:\n\u00a0\n9.

But whether you\u2019ve decided yet to vote Leave or Remain, if you\u2019re holidaying abroad this summer, you might want to consider buying your foreign currency now.\nThe Brexit debate has already played a significant role in undermining the value of the pound. As recently as the end of the year, \u00a31 was worth as much as \u20ac1.42 \u2013 today it buys only \u20ac1.26. Similarly, while \u00a31 was worth $1.56 last September, it has since fallen to $1.44. In February, on the day Boris Johnson came out for the Brexit campaign, the pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar since 2009.\nThese lower exchange rates mean your money will have less purchasing power during those all-important two weeks off. If you\u2019d changed \u00a3500 into euros at the end of last year, you\u2019d have received \u20ac710 \u2013 today you\u2019ll get only \u20ac630 to spend on holiday; similarly, your \u00a3500 used to buy $780, but now it gets you just $720.\nMoreover, in the event that voters opt for Brexit, there may be further declines. The investment bank Goldman Sachs has warned that a Leave vote would be likely to trigger an almost immediate 15 to 20 per cent fall in the value of sterling.\n\u201cA vote for the UK to exit from the EU is an event that would increase uncertainty, weigh on the UK outlook and raise concerns of foreign investors \u2013 potentially interrupting the flow of capital to the UK, sending the pound much lower,\u201d the bank argues.\nIn which case, should you buy your holiday currency straight away? Well, there is a powerful argument for doing so: in the event that you leave your currency purchases until after the referendum, you may have to spend 15 to 20 per cent more to get the amount of holiday cash you want.\nThe counter-argument is that if the UK votes to stay in the EU on 23 June, the pound may recover some or all of the losses it has made in recent months. Brexit aside, the outlook for sterling is relatively strong, particularly against the euro. The Bank of England is almost universally expected to raise interest rates in the UK before the European Central Bank does so in the single currency zone \u2013 all other things being equal, that\u2019s an incentive for currency market investors to buy pounds.\nIn other words, there\u2019s a risk to buying in advance of the referendum. Within days of a Remain vote, you could be regretting having missed out on the rising value of the pound.\nStill, it has to be said that the potential downside of not buying ahead of the referendum is likely to be greater than the risk of doing so \u2013 at least on the Goldman Sachs forecasts. A vote to Remain would be unlikely to trigger a rise in the pound as large as 15 to 20 per cent. In that context, it makes more sense to act now \u2013 unless you\u2019re especially confident that the referendum result won\u2019t be Brexit.\nWhenever you buy your currency, however, make sure you get the best value you can whatever the prevailing exchange rate \u2013 that means getting a good deal on the transaction. That will require some shopping around between currency exchange services, but there are some general guidelines that it makes sense to follow.\nFirst, avoid buying last minute at the currency exchange booths in the airport \u2013 these are routinely 10 per cent more expensive than elsewhere. Similarly, it often makes sense to steer clear of the high street banks, which rarely offer as good a deal as currency market specialists, or even dealers such as the Post Office or Thomas Cook.\nIf you\u2019re planning on simply withdrawing cash from ATMs once you\u2019re overseas, check what you\u2019ll be charged for doing so. In addition to potentially uncompetitive exchange rates, there may be expensive transaction fees to pay on withdrawals.\nOne option that appeals to an increasing number of holidaymakers \u2013 and might be a good idea for those wanting to lock in to today\u2019s exchange rates \u2013 is a prepaid currency card loaded with foreign cash ahead of the big trip that you can then spend to your heart\u2019s delight much like a conventional debit card.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"], "arts-entertainment/films/features": ["Richard Linklater is more than a name - he's an adjective. \u00a0\nMuch like David Lynch's name heralds the downright uncanny and Quentin Tarantino will forever be synonymous with\u00a0extreme violence (and dodgy third acts), Linklater is a director whose films are relatable snapshots of life; the act of settling down to one can be likened\u00a0to opening the curtains and peering out the living room window.\nWell, I don\u2019t know.

Desperate to abscond from his criminal paymasters and keep his family safe, he wants asylum in the UK in exchange for information, recruiting Perry as his go-between. And so the ordinary guy, more like a Hitchcock hero than a Le Carr\u00e9 spook, becomes entangled in the bigger picture. Leading the attempt to bring Dima in is government fixer Hector Meredith, played by Damian Lewis.\u00a0\n\u201cThis film is about the movement of money,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s about the corrupting nature of money and London as a financial centre, London as a honey-pot for rich foreign nationals and the way in which London has changed, the influence of the Russian oligarchy here and now, buying up third, fourth, fifth homes. And [it\u2019s about] the way in which politicians are compromised endlessly by big business because that\u2019s part of being a politician.\u201d\nWith Perry gradually bearing witness to high-ranking corruption in the British government, Lewis gestures from his hotel suite towards Westminster. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much of a stretch of imagination to realise that is going on daily around us. I would hesitate to say any of our politicians are getting direct hand-outs from Russian mobsters! But certainly tax breaks for big multi-national companies that are set up here \u2013 we like to give those out, don\u2019t we? Low corporate tax, it\u2019s all part and parcel of the same thing, isn\u2019t it? So it\u2019s a good story to tell now.\u201d\nNor was it the first time Le Carr\u00e9 proved prophetic. Take Anton Corbijn\u2019s \n\u201cHe is so contemporary,\u201d says Skarsg\u00e5rd, who got \u201cstar-struck\u201d spending an evening in Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s company. \u201cHis knowledge of the world\u2026 he\u2019s absolutely up to date on everything\u2026 he\u2019s not a man that has edged away from the world. He\u2019s very much living in it.\u201d The Swedish-born actor first read one of his books \u2013 \n\u201cIt was the first adult book I read,\u201d recalls Skarsg\u00e5rd. \u201cI was so taken by the infinite sadness of that book. But the sadness of his books is almost romantic. It has this beautiful sad quality to it. But even if it tells stories about cynical people, and the horrible mechanics of power, his books never become cynical because it has this layer of sadness about the state of affairs, and the conditions for humanity.\u201d\nCertainly, Le Carr\u00e9 has always had a nose for uncovering the villains-least-likely, those operating beneath the cover of respectability: think, for example, of the corrupt pharmaceutical company at the heart of his 2001 novel \nDanish-born Susanne Bier, who directed the series, admits the author was a remarkable resource when it came to researching this world. \u201cJohn Le Carr\u00e9 has an incredibly well-developed network of people who he talks to.

They also suit all skin types, being brilliant for removing excess sebum from pores for oily, breakout-prone skin and conditioning for dry areas.\nAll of our favourites below are used in the same way: massage one or two pumps (depending on how much make-up, if any, you\u2019re wearing) into your skin, splash with a little water to emulsify, then remove with warm water and a flannel.\n1. \nThe balm version of this is one of my all-time favourite products, and the oil doesn\u2019t disappoint either. It gives a super-effective, deep clean that doesn\u2019t require you to go back over your face again to remove the last traces of foundation, makes light work of mascara and is far cheaper per ml than many we tested.\n2. \nVotary is the brand on every skincare aficionado's lips right now, and we love its all-natural blend of apricot, rose geranium and sunflower and rose oils. It feels thinner and more refined than most, without that slightly olive oil-like gloopiness, and comes with a flannel for proper cleansing. It's our favourite for morning cleansing, and we also love the luxe, dark green glass bottle and rose gold label.\n3. \nUna Brennan\u2019s offering easily holds its own against its more expensive competitors. It smells gorgeous and our tester, who suffers from breakouts and dry patches, found that it improved the condition of her skin and left it feeling clean and refreshed. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t come with a pump, but at this price we\u2019ll let it off.\n4. \nIt was a Japanese brand that first brought oil-based cleansers to the mass market in 1967, and DHC was one of the first to make it big in the UK. This cult favourite is our go-to for evening cleansing, making light work of eye make-up, foundation and SPF. Its scent is distinctively olive oil-like, so it hasn't got the luxury feel of other brands, but darn is it effective.\n5. \nThis is almost worth buying just for the sweet, fresh scent, which I can only describe as reminding me of lemon drizzle cake. As for the rest, it is made of a blend of 90 per cent natural oils, including winter rose oil, which is rich in anti-inflammatory omega-9, and melts make-up off the skin.\n6. \nFittingly for a brand that is primarily known for make-up, Mac\u2019s cleansing oil deals with a full face like nothing else. It takes off everything, including red lipstick and waterproof mascara, with minimal pressure. A great choice for minimal effort make-up removal after a night out.\n7.\nI love Elizabeth Arden, and not just because the brand\u2019s gold packaging appeals to my magpie tendencies. We found that the brand\u2019s oil is particularly good for tired, dull skin or skin that is starting to show signs of ageing as its omegas and vitamin E help restore moisture and suppleness. Proper TLC for your face.\n8.\u00a0\nOur tester found that Origins\u2019s option turned the chore of cleansing into something of a treat, easily removing eye make-up and leaving sensitive, dry skin feeling nourished and looking healthier after three days\u2019 use. The only downside is that the bottle doesn\u2019t come with a pump so application can be a little messier than most.\n9. \nFresh\u2019s oil has serious nourishing powers, with omegas 3, 6, 7 and 9 from seaberry, nigella, camellia seed, cranberry seed and grapeseed oils, leaving skin soft and plumped. Our tester, who has sensitive skin and usually struggles to find products that suit her, had no problems whatsoever with it.\n10. \nFrom a slightly less obvious brand choice for skincare, this lightweight, fresh-fragranced oil feels totally luxurious and calming on the skin. Cranberry oil and vitamin E help to retain moisture and the cucumber-like scent makes the cleansing process thoroughly refreshing.\nIf budget is your concern, Superfacialist by Una Brennan holds its own against the pricier, bigger-name brands, while Votary is the ultimate luxury option. But for a mid-price, get-the-job-done oil that also nourishes the skin, Clinique\u2019s Take The Day Off is a solid choice.", "Just like decorating, the key to a successful tan is all in the prep. Exfoliate 24 hours earlier and then moisturise about 15 minutes before tanning. Add moisturiser over eyebrows and run an ice cube over your skin to close pores. Apply a thin layer of self-tan all over the face and down the neck to avoid a tidemark. Don't go too close to the hair line, either. Wash palms and remember to exfoliate two to three times a week to ensure an even fade.\n1. \nThe original Sleep Mask Tan produced a softly sun kissed glow the morning after, but if you're olive-toned or prefer a deep bronze look, then this, the brand new Go Darker, will deliver a two-weeks-in-the-Caribbean tan, overnight. Both are fragrance free, easy to apply (like a night cream, just before bed and stay away from water for eight hours), stain free (no pillow marks the next day) and fade naturally and evenly. But it's the skincare benefits that set James Read apart: anti-ageing black rose oil, elasticity-restoring hyaluronic acid, firming aloe vera, exfoliating fruit extracts and antioxidant grapefruit juice improve skin texture, reduce visibility of wrinkles and encourage collagen. This tanner felt like it was a league apart from many others tested, softening and nourishing the skin and producing a beautiful, even, natural-looking tan.\n2. \nA fast-acting, softening self-tan, Lancome delivers a natural-looking glow in just one hour. One of the easiest to use, simply apply a pearl-sized dot to your face, blend it in, wash your hands and continue with the rest of your skincare routine. My skin looked radiant and healthy-looking rather than overly tanned, while the lightweight texture ensures pores didn't clog. And you can build it up over a week or so. It had no hint of orange and didn\u2019t streak or smell like a fake tan.\n3.\nFor novice self-tanners, or very fair complexions, this brand new tanning serum is a great place to start \u2013 you can't make mistakes with a gradual tanner. Neroli, sweet orange and rose essential oils add a touch of luxury to this hybrid premium skincare tanner. Simply mix one or two pumps with your serum or moisturiser for an ultra-subtle golden glow. For more colour and a deeper bronze, just apply without diluting in your usual skincare product, leave to sink in for a few minutes, then follow with your usual serum/moisturiser routine. It takes two to three hours to develop and delivers a natural looking colour. Re-apply daily to maintain.\n4. \nLaunched a couple of years ago, this is an excellent all-rounder and already a best-seller. It has a four to six hour development time \u2013 so apply in the evening and wash off the next morning. Or apply in the morning as a tinted moisturiser and allow it to develop. I'm always a bit nervous of allowing self-tans to develop when I'm out and about, so I tested it in the evening. Build up your tan by applying nightly until the colour you're after is achieved. Hydrating botanicals smooth and nourish, while matrixyl-3000 \u2013 an anti-ageing, collagen-stimulating blend of two peptides \u2013 reduces the appearances of fine lines and wrinkles by plumping from within.\n5. \nThis antioxidant packed, anti-ageing self-tan contains only 3 per cent DHA (the active tanning ingredient), which means it delivers a very natural light tan. The sun kissed glow achieved suits fairer complexions, or it can be used to top-up tans on holiday or when you return. Easy to apply, ultra-nourishing and fool proof, this one is great for building up colour if you're a novice tanner. Just apply at bedtime and wake up to a gentle golden glow the morning after.\n6. \nThis clever little concentrated serum will turn your usual moisturiser into a gradual tanner. Simply add a couple of drops to your usual skincare and apply. Use daily until you achieve the colour you're after \u2013 completely streak-free and foolproof. This won't give you a full-on bronze glow instantly, but will ensure your complexion looks a little less pale without breaking the bank \u2013 great for tired, washed-out skin that needs a boost.\n7. \nIf you're prone to dry skin and the dehydrating DHA in self-tan only makes things worse, this ultra-nourishing tanner is for you. Packed with hydrating coconut water, aloe and green tea, plus anti-ageing vitamins C, A and E to boost cell renewal and help increase collagen production, this leaves the complexion smooth and nourished. A word of warning: it is terrifyingly dark and quite runny \u2013 you only need a little and have to work it into the skin quickly. And it smells strongly of coconut \u2013 not to everyone's taste \u2013 but better than the biscuit-y fake tan smell. But for experienced tanners, this is the one for you. It delivers a stunning deep bronze glow that fades evenly, without patchiness.\n8. \nDon't be put off by the 'oil' in this tanner; this is lightweight, non-greasy and quick-drying. No way near as dark as other St Tropez products, this delivers a natural golden glow that suits paler skin, or a gentle, slightly sun-kissed look on darker tones. It's wonderfully nourishing and heavenly scented with essential oils of lemongrass, neroli and grapefuit \u2013 a luxurious oil to use at bedtime.\nFor novice tanners,\u00a0"], "student/student-life/finances": ["The student whose GoFundMe public appeal \nEmma McCormick, 18, a first-year at Newcastle University, had decided to take inspiration from a fundraising campaign which aimed to get Kanye West out of debt by starting her own with a goal of raising \u00a3500.\nOriginally, she had only managed to reach \u00a310 after two months.

When, like the BBC, it occupies a unique place in the nation\u2019s cultural life and its affections the difficulties of matching aspiration to resource is still more acute.\nEver since John Birt\u2019s director-generalship almost three decades ago\u00a0successive management teams have taken on more and more, against sometimes intense public and political pressure to limit rises in its licence revenue. In recent years what has been asked of the corporation has been remarkable: a freeze on the licence fee since 2010; a marked expansion in its service provision, from catch-up to the ever expanding website; plus taking responsibility for the World Service, paying the \u00a3600 million\u00a0a year cost of free licences for the over 75s; and making a contribution to the cost of rolling out broadband nationally.\u00a0\nThe BBC has plenty of scope for cost cutting, and has proved as much with, for example, a one-third chop in the cost of its middle management in one year flat, thus confirming the worst fears aroused by the satirical \nThat suggests the BBC will be doing less light entertainment, fewer game shows, and can scale back Radio 1 and 2 and other types of output obviously well catered for elsewhere (and where the BBC\u2019s excellence has not produced a valuable stream of future revenues and profits from its commercial arm). As a corollary, the inflated fees paid to \u201cthe talent\u201d can be reduced in line with their lower profile on BBC services, which should be a little more serious and a little less populist.\nIn return for that, the Government should allow the BBC licence fee to increase with average earnings, (and indeed reduce with them in times of hardship and recession), and modernise the licence so that it becomes a levy on any individual with access to a television, radio or the internet either in the home or in their car. In the next Charter period the BBC, and the whole nation, can look forward to a stable and creative future. As with so many technical and artistic challenges, the BBC can do it if we allow it to do so. \u00a0", "The Government has been accused of putting a \u201cticking time bomb under the BBC\u201d after ministers stepped back from fundamental reform but gave the corporation just five years free from political interference.\nUnder the terms of a \nBut ministers have inserted a five year \u2018break clause\u2019 in the Charter which could allow a future Conservative Government to re-open negotiations with the corporation after the next general election.\nThe Culture Secretary, John Whittingdale, said that in the long run the licence fee was \u201clikely to become less sustainable\u201d and would have to be overhauled entirely.\nLord Waheed Alli, the former television executive who launched a campaign group to fight plans to diminish the BBC, said it was clear that Mr Whittingdale had \u201cbeen forced to back down on some of his wilder proposals,\u201d but had shown\u00a0himself to be \u201cideologically committed to undermining the BBC\u201d.\n\u201cWhile this (Charter) may not destroy public service broadcasting immediately, it is only right to warn how this can do real and lasting damage the long term,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is a ticking time bomb under the BBC.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s shadow Culture Secretary, Maria Eagle, said that most of Mr Whittingdale's \u201cwilder proposals\u201d had been \u201cwatered down, dumped or delayed\u201d.

The BBC can therefore ensure it holds the balance of votes, but executives at the corporation believe that doing so would create a board that would become too large and unwieldy.\nLord Hall, the director-general, said: \u201cWe have an honest disagreement with the Government on this. I do not believe that the appointments proposals for the new unitary board are yet right. We will continue to make the case to government.

Jon Platt, a 45-year-old company director from the Isle of Wight, refused to pay the penalty. He was taken to court under the 1996 Education Act. But last October, magistrates dismissed the case against the businessman.\nThe Isle of Wight Council took the case to the High Court to seek a definitive ruling, but were told by the judge: \u201cThe magistrates did not err in law.\u201d\nOutside the court, Mr Platt said: \u201cThe law is nice and clear: if your kids go to school regularly, you can take them on holiday during term time.\u201d\nHe told \nBut Jonathan Bacon, Leader of the Isle of Wight Council, told \n\u201cThis is not a question about who is\u00a0in the right and who is\u00a0in the wrong.

We also plan to strengthen statutory guidance to schools and local authorities.\u201d\nUntil new rules take effect, the judgment could lead to cheaper family holidays all year round, as parents who are prepared to take their children out of school spread demand more evenly.\nThe travel business is different from other industries. Because the supply of airline seats, rental cars and hotel beds\u00a0is\u00a0fixed during the year, prices can surge dramatically at times of high demand\u00a0- coinciding with school holidays. The average holiday firm or leisure airline trades at a loss for most of the year, but more than makes up for it when the schools are out.\nA typical example is provided by the benchmark European flight: a one-way hop on easyJet from Gatwick to Barcelona. The fare next Saturday is \u00a368. A week later, at the start of half-term for most families, the price for the same seat on the same plane more than trebles to \u00a3208.\nThe judgment implies that the definition of \u201cregular attendance\u201d is set at 90 per cent - a figure Mr Platt's daughter achieved even with the holiday. \nMr Platt was happy with the prospect that one in 10 of the children in his daughter\u2019s class could be absent on holiday at any one time. \u201cWe\u2019ll have small class sizes, won\u2019t we?,\u201d he said.\nTens of thousands of parents who have paid fixed penalties - regarding them as part of the cost of the holiday - may now seek to have their money refunded.", "San Sebastian airport is close to France. How close? Well, the runway juts into the Bidassoa River, which divides Spain from France, and the international frontier has to do a little wiggle around the runway to ensure the airport remains in Spanish territory.\nIf you have been lucky enough to visit the culinary hub of northern Spain, you almost certainly didn\u2019t fly in to the city\u2019s airport. San Sebastian airport is 12 miles east along the coast from the pintxo bars of the Old Town, occupying just about the only swathe of flat land in this part of the Basque Country. You can fly to it from anywhere you like, so long as it\u2019s Barcelona or Madrid. So San Sebastian, currently European Capital of Culture, is the single significant Spanish city not accessible by air from Britain.\nLast weekend, I crossed the river over the footbridge from Hendaye - the last town in France - which passes the runway. San Sebastian airport was quiet. It usually is; six domestic flights represents a good day. But starting this summer, the arrivals board will see a new arrival: Luton. Twice a week from 26 July, Air Nostrum will link the Bedfordshire airport with the Basque Country\u2019s loveliest city. And that is a signal that the airline industry is back in an expansive mood, filling gaps in the market that I didn\u2019t realise existed.\nIn 1976, when I first visited San Sebastian, the journey involved an overnight ferry and a two-day hitch-hike through France. For the past two decades, reaching San Sebastian has been much simpler: fly to either Biarritz in France or the de facto Spanish Basque capital of Bilbao. This summer, there are more options than ever, with British Airways returning to the Heathrow-Biarritz route.\nThe trip from Biarritz is fun - a walk, a main-line train and a narrow-gauge train - and takes about two hours. From Bilbao airport, coaches run frequently and directly to San Sebastian\u2019s strange subterranean estacion de buses, taking about an hour. So the absence of flights to San Sebastian hasn\u2019t exactly been a problem. But in any event, Air Nostrum - the regional airline affiliated with Iberia - proposes a solution to fill a perceived gap in the market.\nI have flown on Air Nostrum, from Malaga to Bilbao, and it is not far off a private jet experience. The Luton-San Sebastian link uses a Canadair Regional Jet, with fewer than 50 passengers - about a quarter the capacity of the rival services to Bilbao and Biarritz. You might imagine this would help to justify a big premium for the new flights - as well, of course, as the fast access to San Sebastian's pintxo (Basque tapas) delights. In fact, Air Nostrum is selling at a discount. I priced a flight going out on the first flight on 26 July, back a week later. The fare was \u00a3111, compared with \u00a3115 on Ryanair on the same dates between Stansted and Biarritz. And the Spanish airline offers a free checked bag of 23kg - while the Irish carrier wants \u00a380 return to carry a slightly smaller case. If you plan a summer trip to northern Spain and haven\u2019t yet booked, you could grab a bargain.\nAir Nostrum won\u2019t be making a fortune on the route - this summer at least - but the airline is happy to dip a toe in the Bidassoa. The move helps the airline solve the problem of \u201cWhat shall we do with our planes and pilots during the long weeks of summer, when the demand from business travellers to fly domestic short-hops dries up?\u201d On Tuesdays, for example, the morning arrival from Madrid then turns around and heads north to Luton, returning in time to operate the late afternoon leg back to the Spanish capital. If the flight\u2019s revenue can meet its direct operating costs then the accountants will be happy. As will the passengers. But don\u2019t get too accustomed to it - when the price of fuel rises and/or the economy slows, experience suggests routes like this are the first to get shelved. Make the most of the Luton link while the sun shines on the crumpled shores of the Bay of Biscay.", "On the current Fred. Olsen cruise aboard \nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of cruises affected by this unpleasant illness. But passengers who fall ill have few rights. If the cruise actually ends early, so you don\u2019t get the length of voyage you paid for, you will normally get a refund and/or credit towards a future cruise. But if you wanted to see the coast of New England or Norway and instead saw the inside of your cabin\u2019s bathroom, there is no recompense. And there is no option to cancel without penalty if you are worried about contracting the virus.\nTo minimise the risk, be scrupulous about keeping your hands clean.

Simon Calder, travel correspondent and former teacher, answers your questions.\nPackage holiday prices typically rise by 50 to 100 per cent when schools are out. Increases in air fares tend to be more extreme, with some prices multiplying three\u00a0or four-fold. A typical example: a one-way hop on easyJet from Gatwick to Barcelona next Saturday costs \u00a368. A week later, at the start of half-term for most families, the price for the same seat on the same plane more than trebles to \u00a3208.\n\u00a0\nThe very highest spike in prices tends to be during February half term with families skiing in the Alps. British Airways is asking \u00a3750 for a Gatwick-Geneva return flight next February half-term \u2013\u00a0more than some fares to Australia and back.\u00a0\nLike any sensible business, a travel firm will seek to maximise its earnings for the benefit of shareholders and staff. However, I don't see excess profits being made \u2013\u00a0indeed, most holiday companies are low-margin businesses.\u00a0\nTravel isn't like most industries. If an ice-cream maker detects high demand during a warm summer, it can produce more in response. But the supply of airline seats, hotel beds and rental cars is fixed (in the short term, at least). The average holiday firm or leisure airline trades at a loss for most of the year, but more than makes up for the shortfall when the schools are out. Since most schools have similar holidays, demand surges when the school term ends.\nUntil 2013, head teachers in England were able to grant up to two weeks a year for family holidays in \"special circumstances\". But the then-Education Secretary\u00a0Michael Gove, cracked down on parents taking children out of school during term-time, imposing fixed-penalty fines of \u00a360 for unauthorised absences. In response, a\u00a0petition signed by more than 200,000 people asked the government to ban travel firms from increasing prices in line with demand: \"It's time to stop the holiday companies cashing in on school holidays and let parents have some guilt-free family time! Enforce action that caps the percentage increase on holiday prices in school holidays\". \u00a0But the consequence of any such law would be to reduce drastically the availability of travel, and there is no prospect of it happening.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJon Platt, a 45-year-old company director from the Isle of Wight, took his daughter to Florida against the wishes of her school. He was issued with a fixed penalty but refused to pay it. He was taken to court under the 1996 Education Act, but magistrates dismissed the case. The Isle of Wight Council sought clarification in the High Court.\u00a0\nLord Justice Lloyd Jones upheld the magistrates' view that Mr Platt's daughter's overall attendance record was satisfactor\u00a0and he had no case to answer.\u00a0\nThe judgment implies that parents need only demonstrate \"regular attendance\" of at least 90 per cent of school days. With a typical academic year involving 190 school days, the ruling suggests that 19 days of absence\u00a0is acceptable \u2013\u00a0corresponding to almost four weeks.\nShould a parent's right to a cheap holiday in Florida transcend a school's right to expect regular attendance? If every parent decides to take advantage of the ruling by removing children for two or three weeks, classrooms could become chaotic.\u00a0\nLong ago and far away I used to be a maths teacher. I would not relish the prospect of explaining differential equations to a class of teenagers, then teaching the same lesson again a fortnight later when their pals return from Walt Disney World.\u00a0\nWhile I appreciate the benefits that travel can bring to a rounded education, my interpretation of the number of school-age British children I see in the theme parks of Florida in November is that they are not studying the complex interaction of potential energy, angular velocity and gravity \u2013\u00a0they are enjoying a cheap holiday.\u00a0\nThe Department for Education says: \"Every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chance of gaining good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their life chances,\" and will move quickly to change the law and \"strengthen statutory guidance to schools and local authorities\".\nThat appears to be one implication of the legal reasoning behind the High Court's decision: if a child attended school for at least 90 per cent of the academic year overall, then parents should be able to claim back the penalty for unauthorised absence. But if a family had two weeks in Florida in November, and then later the child was off school for two more weeks, the argument would not stand.", "Given the circumstances, Virgin Atlantic has been much more generous than it needed to be. Assuming you were travelling on non-refundable and non-changeable tickets, an airline is entitled to keep your money and simply suggest you claim on\u00a0your travel insurance - which, as you say, was not in place.\nMost airlines sell highly restricted tickets knowing that a proportion of passengers will have to cancel. That is not an unreasonable practice, given that in many\u00a0cases the passenger will claim on their travel insurance.\nNormally a \u201cno-show\u201d would trigger an automatic cancellation of your tickets.

So they looked like, and were built like, Mercedes-Benz saloons: solidly over-engineered, but no lookers. Later on came some vaguely fashionable SUVs such as the RX, and then some more adventurously styled saloons such as the IS.

In comparison, young white males from disadvantaged households performed the worst, with only 8.9 per cent of 18-year old white men on free school meals entering HE.\nAnother key finding to emerge is that over 80 per cent of universities have more female than male students - 123 institutions versus 26 - yet new analysis conducted for Hepi by the Office for Fair Access (Offa) has shown only two have targets for recruiting more male students.\nFurthermore, male underachievement is also evident when it comes to drop-out rates and degree performance. Previously unpublished data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) show eight per cent of men - compared to six per cent of women - are no longer at university following their year of entry, while 69 per cent of men achieve a 2:1 or above, compared to 73 per cent of women.\nNick Hillman, co-author of the report and Hepi\u2019s director, has recommended more widening participation spending should be focused on boys, including a new \u2018Take Our Sons to University Day\u2019, the involvement of male role models in all widening participation activities, and more foundation years.\nHe said: \u201cNearly everyone seems to have a vague sense our education system is letting young men down, but there are few detailed studies of the problem and almost no clear policy recommendations on what to do about it.\u201d\nDespite the statistics on males, Mr Hillman acknowledged the \u201csubstantial challenges\u201d still being faced by women, and highlighted how female graduates earn lower salaries than males, female academics face \u201ctoo many obstacles\u201d in being promoted, and said lad culture can make \u201clife uncomfortable\u201d for female students too.\u00a0\nThough, he added: \u201cBut policymaking is not a zero-sum game in which you have to choose between caring for one group or the other. Indeed, we can only tackle the socio-economic gap in HE participation by focusing on the underachievement of young men, and particularly disadvantaged young white men.\u201d\nMary Curnock Cook, the head of Ucas, pointed out that girls born in 2016 are on course to be 75 per cent more likely to go to university than boys of the same age.\nShe writes in the report\u2019s foreword that Hepi\u2019s evidence and possible solutions to the growing imbalance in educational achievement of boys is \u201cenormously useful\u201d and highlights \u201cjust how complex\u201d the topic is.\nShe adds: \u201cThe evidence is compelling.

In that time, just under 92 per cent of patients at all A&Es were dealt with in less than four hours \u2013 the worst performance since 2003/04, but still, NHS England said, one of the best in the Western world.\nHowever, the monthly figures show that waiting times performance has deteriorated rapidly, for A&E and for routine operations. The number of patients in March who had been on a waiting list for more than 18 weeks was 298,747, up from 206,032 in the same month last year. At hospital A&Es, only 80.9 per cent were seen within four hours, down from 88.9 per cent for the same time last year, and 95.3 per cent for March 2011.\nThe Royal College of Nursing said that the figures reflected \u201cthe unfortunate reality\u201d of everyday life on England\u2019s A&Es, while Labour\u2019s shadow Health Secretary, Heidi Alexander, claimed the publication of the data represented \u201cBlack Thursday for the NHS\u201d and said the health service could now be said to be in a state of \u201cconstant crisis\u201d.\nHowever, the Department of Health said that hospitals were coping well with increased demand.\nRichard Barker, national director of commissioning operations and information at NHS England said that March had been \u201cparticularly busy\u201d with more than two million people treated at A&E. He said demand had been increased by a delayed spike in flu cases, adding that delays in securing care outside of hospital for patients and the junior doctor strikes, had also had an impact.\nAnna Crossley, the RCN\u2019s emergency care specialist, said the figures would come as no surprise to frontline staff.\n\u201cA&E departments are facing huge challenges in caring for so many patients, to the point that what used to be exceptional pressure is now becoming the norm,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEmergency care is running on the goodwill and effort of dedicated staff, but that cannot sustain it forever,\u201d she added. \u201cIf the exceptional is now the new norm, we have to be concerned about any additional pressures which could cause the system to be completely overwhelmed.\u201d\nMs Alexander blamed the deterioration in performance on cuts to social care services, which she said had left \u201chundreds of thousands of older people without the support they need to live at home independently.\u201d\n\u201cThis is leaving many people with no choice but to go to A&E,\u201d she said. \u201cMinisters can\u2019t sit back and allow this crisis to go on any longer.\u201d\nJohn Appleby, chief economist at the leading King\u2019s Fund health think tank, agreed that investment in social care services, which are funded by councils, could help to reduce demand on hospitals as well as speeding up the process of moving patients out of hospital beds after recovery.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS is very busy but hospitals are coping well with increased demand, with 21,000 more people seen in A&E within four hours compared to March last year\u00a0- despite having to manage the added pressures of industrial action and the very real impact this has had on patients and staff.\n\u201cWe are committed to delivering a safer seven day NHS which is why we have invested \u00a310bn to fund the NHS's own plan to transform services in the future.\u201d", "Women suffering from breast cancer are turning to alternative and complementary therapies while rejecting chemotherapy, scientists have warned.\nResearchers at Columbia University tracked chemotherapy uptake rates in women who had been recommended the treatment by their doctors. Among women who were taking non-traditional medications such as complementary therapies, they were found to be more likely to reject medical advice to undergo chemotherapy.\nThe researchers found: \u201cComplementary and alternative therapy use among patients with breast cancer has increased in the past two decades. The most commonly used complementary and alternative therapies were dietary supplements and mind-body practices. On average, the women used two such therapies, although nearly 40 per cent of the women reported using three or more complementary and alternative therapies.\n\"Mind-body practices include practices such as yoga, meditation, qi gong, acupuncture, and massage. In the oncology setting, patients may use both dietary supplements and mind-body practices to relieve symptoms, for general health and wellness promotion, and to increase their sense of hope and control.\u00a0\n\u201cDietary supplements usage and a higher simultaneous use of multiple complementary and alternative therapies among women for whom chemotherapy was indicated were associated with a lower likelihood to initiate chemotherapy than nonusers, according to the results.\u201d\nThe research expressed concerns that there is currently no evidence alternative therapies work: \"To date, in the breast oncology setting the majority of dietary supplement interventions have not proven beneficial.\"\nResearcher Professor Greenlee said: \u201cThough the majority of women with clinically indicated chemotherapy initiated treatment, 11 per cent did not. A cautious interpretation of results may suggest to oncologists that it is beneficial to ascertain the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapy among their patients and to consider use of alternative treatment as a potential marker of patients at risk of not initiating clinically indicated chemotherapy.\u201d\nDr Emma Smith, science information manager at Cancer Research UK, told The Independent: \u201cIt's every woman's right to choose whether or not to have chemotherapy as part of their breast cancer treatment. But in making their decision they shouldn't think of complementary and alternative therapies as a substitute for conventional cancer medicines. Treatments like chemotherapy, targeted drugs and radiotherapy have been researched in well-designed clinical trials and are proven to be effective for cancer patients.\u00a0\n\u201cAlthough research has shown that some complementary treatments might help to improve quality of life, there is no evidence that they improve survival. Some may be harmful, and possibly interfere with conventional treatments like chemotherapy. If you are considering using complementary therapies it's important to speak to your doctor first to make sure it's safe.\u201d", "Making abortion illegal does not reduce the number of terminations women have, a study has concluded.\nThe research, \nIn countries where abortions are legal on a woman\u2019s request, 34 women in every 1,000 have\u00a0one. In countries where abortions are always illegal or legal only if a woman\u2019s life is in danger, 37 women in every 1,000 have\u00a0one.\nThe slight increase in rates where abortion is illegal may be due to these countries also tending to have more restricted access to contraception which increases conception rates.\nProfessor Diana Greene Foster from the University of California said of the findings: \u201cThe obvious interpretation is that criminalising abortion does not prevent it but, rather drives women to seek illegal services or measures. But this simple story overlooks the many women who, in the absence of safe and legal services, carry unwanted pregnancies to term. Women who live in countries where abortion is illegal often have little access to the whole range of family planning services, including contraceptive supplies, counselling, information and safe abortion.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Marie Stopes International said: \"This study\u00a0reinforces the fact that restricting access to abortion makes no significant difference to the number of women who choose to have one. Instead, restrictions make it more likely that women will turn to unsafe practitioners, whose methods range from counterfeit drugs to industrial poisons or wire coathangers.

There are no data to support the theory of intrinsically toxic properties of gluten in otherwise healthy adults and children.\n\u201cGluten free packaged foods frequently contain a greater density of fat and sugar than their gluten-containing counterparts. Obesity, overweight and new-onset insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome have been identified after initiation of a gluten-free diet. It also may lead to deficiencies in B vitamins, folate, and iron, given a lack of nutrient fortification of many gluten-free products.\u201d\u00a0\nShe also warned that unnecessary gluten-free diets could also place considerable financial burdens on people as gluten-free specialist versions of items such as bread or cakes can cost considerably more than standard versions.\nThe gluten-free market is rapidly growing around the world. It has grown 136 per cent between 2013 and 2015 and is estimated to be worth more than $4bn dollars globally.\u00a0", "A young woman has thanked social media users for helping her hunt\u00a0down a correct diagnosis for\u00a0an incurable\u00a0genetic condition that had left doctors mystified.\nCheyenne Adele Rose told the image-sharing website Imgur of the numerous injuries, broken limbs and constant pain which threatened to end her career as a dancer.\nShe said she was \"terrified\"\u00a0she would no longer be able to dance and that \"countless neurologists, neurosurgeons and spinal specialists\" could not\u00a0tell her what was wrong.\nBut when \n\"Don't be fooled by my happy face, this isn't great news, because there isn't a cure to this genetic disease,\" she wrote beside a\u00a0picture of herself saying thank you.\n\"[But] I have been searching for a 'title' to what's wrong with me for years, and if it weren't for you all, I wouldn't have one.\n\"So thank you, Imgur, from the bottom of my heart, you have helped me find closure in one part of my life.\"\nEDS, which is usually an\u00a0inherited condition, weakens the connective tissue that supports the skin, tendons,\u00a0blood vessels, organs and bones - resulting in severe pain and dizziness.\nFrom aged 12, Ms Rose broke and dislocated her arms, ankles, toes, hips and feet - amd\u00a0spent years on crutches, in a wheelchair and strapped into a\u00a0machine which exercised her leg for up to six hours a day.\nAfter appearing to recover in 2012, the dancer's symptoms then returned in worsened form.\nMs Rose had said: \"Over the past year I have been experiencing extreme back pain, headaches, blacking out, and losing feeling in my arms and legs while dancing.\"\nA test proved that she had Hyper Mobility Type III of the disease.\nWhile there is no known cure, there are supportive treatments and therapies for the areas of the body affected and the diagnosis itself can avoid misdiagnosis of other labels such as depression and chronic fatigue.\n\"It's something I'm going to have to live with my entire life, but thanks to you crazy people, I finally have a diagnosis,\" she said.\nOne Imgur user replied: \"I'm a dancer with EDS too!

It will include a tax on antibiotics as one possible mechanism to raise money to address AMR, although it is not highlighted as a preferred option.\n\u201cThe idea of using the tax system, or some other form of charging, is definitely something we have explored and have ideas about on the pharma industry,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so why would it not be something that would be relevant for all those participants that are part of what in classic economic terms would be regarded as a market failure problem?\u201d\nHe said such mechanisms for tackling drug resistance were very much in keeping with the strategy of the Government-commissioned review. \u201cThe whole approach has been thinking about it from an economic perspective, and assuming all the knowledge we can on the science and therefore we\u2019re trying to think of the right incentives, rewards, penalties in order to come up with solutions,\u201d he said.\nDrawing on his experiences of the recent financial crash, O\u2019Neill said he wanted to encourage consumers and companies to realise it was in their interests to act before it was too late.\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m saying that as someone whose come obviously out of the finance industry and been through the financial crisis. You know, it\u2019s like, that was a train wreck. How did nobody ever notice it but plenty of us could see it coming \u2013 we just didn\u2019t know when and what [was] the right thing to do.\n\u201cBut here you can see a very different, much more troubling train wreck coming because of the lives lost and all the rest of it.\u201d\nAlthough the overuse of antibiotics in human healthcare is widely viewed as the bigger cause of drug resistant bacteria, veterinary use of the drugs outstrips human use globally. However, until recently, little attention has been focused on this area.\nIn December, the AMR Review called for a reduction in antibiotic use in livestock farming, and for drugs that are important for human medicines to be curtailed or even banned on farms.\nThe body warned that human health was at risk from antibiotic resistant infections being passed on via the food chain, from direct contact with infected animals and from farm waste.\nIn his interview with the bureau, Lord O\u2019Neill was guarded about the contents of next week\u2019s report, but said it would not specifically call for a tax on food companies.\nHowever, when asked whether some kind of charge similar to the \u201csugar tax\u201d could be on the agenda, he said it was a move that could be expected somewhere down the line.\nHe said: \u201cIf big food producers don\u2019t see that it\u2019s in their own enlightened self interest to shift to a more sustainable model then it will inevitably become a policy attraction at some point.

This time it's not with Israel but rather between refugees and the UN agency charged with assisting them.\nSince shortly after being expelled or fleeing during the nakba, the 1947-49 Palestinian catastrophe of displacement that accompanied Israel's creation, refugees in camps in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria have received food parcels from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Now, in the West Bank, an efficiency-minded UNRWA is altering that practice, prompting high anxiety among refugees.\nFrom now on the food distributions in Amari and seventeen other camps in the Israeli-occupied territory are being discontinued, with UNRWA deciding instead to issue refugees electronic cards so they can make their purchases themselves.\nUNRWA says the change will actually give the refugees purchasing power worth twenty dollars more than they currently get from the parcels of flour, sugar, oil, rice and powdered milk valued at $110 (\u00a378) and given for each member of a family that meets the UN's need criteria.\nBut the rumour mill in the tight-knit camp says people are about to be short changed by UNRWA and that with the cash cards they will be able to purchase much less than the worth of the food parcels they have been getting. ''UNRWA is trying to save money at the expense of the most vulnerable people,'' says Ahmed Tomaileh, an activist on the camp's residents committee. The distributions have been made every three months.\nSpeaking in a youth centre\u00a0that was adorned with posters proclaiming ''Drugs Harm Health\u201c, Mr Tomaileh charged that the shift to electronic cards comes amid other steps UNRWA has taken to scale back its role, including making fewer people eligible for food distribution in recent years, in what he says is an impending withdrawal of financing of social service institutions in the camp, such as its Committee for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled.\n''UNRWA is withdrawing and if UNRWA withdraws this is a conspiracy to end the refugee issue,'' said Mr Tomaileh, whose family fled Anaba village near what is now Ben Gurion Airport in 1948 and walked for a day and a half under severe conditions to reach what became Amari camp across Jordanian lines in the West Bank. Many of Amari's residents or their parents or grandparents were expelled under the command of Yitzhak Rabin, then a young military leader who went on to become Israel's premier. He conceded in his memoirs that it was a ''harsh'' action.\n''We tell UNRWA that we want you to stay. We don't want a change. We want UNRWA to help us until we return to our houses,'' Mr Tomaileh said.\nTo point up anger over the food change and other alleged signs of UNRWA's scaling back its role, leaders of camps across the West Bank decided on protest steps that took effect Monday, including preventing UNRWA cars from entering the camps and closing offices of UNRWA camp directors. ''If they don't pay attention we will escalate,'' Mr Tomaileh said, adding that no violence would be used.\nUNRWA spokesman Christopher Gunness explained that the move to electronic cards would benefit the refugees by giving them greater flexibility and choice, and was more dignified than queing for parcels. He added that the switch to electronic cards comes as part of an effort to meet donor country expectations of efficiencies and internal reforms during a severe financial crisis with a budget deficit of $81m (\u00a356m). ''We have to make sure things are happening that make UNRWA an attractive organization to fund.'' A basic problem for the organization, he says, is that there is no sign of an end to occupation for the refugees, while there is constant greater demand for services due to natural growth.\nFor the poorest of the poor, when coupled with cash disbursements of 35 shekels (\u00a36) per family member, the food distributions are still seen as vital.\n''Definitely we rely on it,'' says Suha Hamad, 41, whose fifteen-year-old son Mohammed is disabled and has an array of medical expenses that the family is hard pressed to meet. ''My husband is a blacksmith and the money he makes is not enough to live with. With the food parcel, we make our own bread, use the rice and the oil is of excellent quality. I use the money to buy medicine for my son.''\nMr Gunness said he is not aware of UNRWA scaling down its funding for camp organizations. ''It may be that certain organizations are deemed to be better partners and that UNRWA is finding other partners and dropping some,'' he said. Regarding the reduction in recent years of the numbers of people receiving food handouts, a UN official said that during the last five years UNRWA has tightened up its checks of eligibility, with social workers conducting needs assessments to make sure that families who do not qualify do not receive the food.\n''I totally understand why any refugee believes there is a political plot to downsize UNRWA and make the refugee problem go away. But it isn't true. Our mandate is not for sale,'' Mr Gunness said. The change is not being made in Gaza because high inflation and economic unpredictability and in fact. there in the context of the Israeli blockade, it is better for people to continue getting the aid as food, he said.\nIn Amari, Hiam Muawad, 52, who is so poor she has been waiting for charity since the sacred fasting month of Ramadan in June to get her teeth fixed, said uncertainty over what will happen with the electronic cards ''is an extra worry.'' But, she added, if the card does in fact enable her to purchase more ''it will be a good thing.''\nHowever, Ms Hamad, the blacksmith's wife, who is convinced she is about to receive less from UNRWA's change, said: ''The protest steps are good. Maybe it will move the situation, maybe they will change their mind.''", "A professor who won a prestigious Israeli prize has promised to donate the award money to a group of peace activists striving to achieve full civic equality between Israelis and Palestinians.\nDavid Shulman, an American-born Israeli who teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, won the Israel Prize\u00a0for his academic work on the languages and cultures of India.\u00a0\nHe said he will donate the $20,000 (\u00a314,000) award to Ta\u2019ayush - an Israeli group, co-founded by Mr Shulman, working to help Palestinians.\nThe award is given out by the State of Israel to people or organisations who have demonstrated excellence in their field and is generally regarded as the state's highest honour.

It said at the time that an investigation has been launched into the cause of the blast.\u00a0\nThe 55-year-old Badreddine had directed Hezbollah's operations in Syria since its fighters joined Assad's forces in 2012, the group's biggest-ever military intervention outside of Lebanon. Thousands of guerrillas fighting alongside Syria's military were crucial to tipping the battlefield in the government's favour on multiple fronts, from the suburbs of Damascus to the northern province of Aleppo.\u00a0\nWith Badreddine's death, Hezbollah is likely to rely on a younger generation of commanders, moving away from the veterans who came of age during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war or during Hezbollah's 18-year war against Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended in 2000.\u00a0\nOne possible successor, Ibrahim Aqil, is among the last major figures from that generation.

There\u2019s a specially made 35-minute documentary fronted by BBC Radio 3\u2019s Sara Mohr-Pietsch, featuring Stravinsky expert Jonathan Cross; shorter clips find musicians such as celebrated pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard and the opera director Peter Sellars discussing their work on Stravinsky\u2019s music; a timeline puts the composer into his historical context alongside the 1929 Wall Street Crash and the rise of Hitler. There\u2019s something here for everyone, whether you know Stravinsky well or have never heard a note of it before.\nIn the sphere of audience development, other orchestras try to play the digital card, but few with quite the Philharmonia\u2019s levels of ambition. Its interactive projects to date include ReRite, an award-winning virtual reality installation that enables the public to discover what it is like to play in Stravinsky\u2019s \nThe Philharmonia\u2019s head of digital, Luke Ritchie, says ReRite has reached 330,000 people, and a 2014 project, iOrchestra, in Devon and Cornwall, built on that success, mixing video, interactive touchscreen technology and live performance: \u201cIt was all about the fact that people find concert halls too exclusive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe built a big tent in Plymouth High Street and anybody could just wander in on their way out of Debenham\u2019s. We got about 90,000 people through the tents and 50 per cent or more stayed for the whole piece.\u201d None of this would be possible, he adds, without the enthusiasm and input of the Philharmonia\u2019s principal conductor and artistic adviser, Esa-Pekka Salonen. The Finnish maestro emphasises that to ignore this communicative potential would be worse than short-sighted. \u201cAt an international educators\u2019 conference I attended last year, it was clear that support for arts education in schools is challenged everywhere in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cTeachers said that for children, an app through the interface of touchscreen is the most natural way to approach any subject: today this is how they interact with the world. I\u2019ve seen one-and-a-half-year-olds navigating the iPad before they can talk. So this is absolutely the way we have to go, to stay relevant.\u201d\nIn 2012 he and the Philharmonia released an app, with Touchpress, called simply \u201cThe Orchestra\u201d. Apps, he suggests, can provide a seamless path into discovering orchestral music because the medium obliterates any unfamiliar \u201cthreshold\u201d to cross.\n\u201cMy experience has been that the music we present is very powerful and very interesting and most people like it very much once they get over the prejudice and all kinds of sociological reservations,\u201d he says.\n\u201cCuriosity is a basic human instinct \u2013 people want to learn and explore \u2013 and I think the biggest challenge for us in the arts, especially classical music, is to find a way to provide a framework for that. With everything in life, from food to watching tennis, the more of a reference you have, the more enjoyable it is and the more powerful the experience itself becomes. I\u2019m encouraged by the feedback we\u2019ve had and I think this is the way to go.\u201d\nIf technology is a passion for Salonen, Stravinsky is even more so. \u201cI\u2019ve always conducted Stravinsky, but mainly the three most famous ballet scores,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve notched up about 120 performances so far of \n\u201cI was always fascinated by the many faces of this composer,\u201d says Salonen \u201cThere was his public persona in the suit, hanging out at cocktail parties with Jean Cocteau; then there was the person who went through a spiritual crisis, went back to the Russian Orthodox Church, used texts from different faiths.

In the first weeks, we created weekly evening sessions where young people met up with sympathetic producers in order to thrash out what this television should be. After several meetings it was clear that music and comedy were top of the agenda. There was a strong feeling that young adults couldn\u2019t see people like themselves or any of their interests reflected on television. We had a strategy.\nThe first pitch came from \u201calternative\u201d comedian Peter Richardson. He proposed a series of films featuring the cream of the new-wave comics. The satirical films would be parodies of different genres. He got particularly animated when describing \nThen came Andrea Wonfor from Tyne-Tees Television. She offered \nAt first I don\u2019t think they believed that I was serious, but when the penny dropped they went for it with incredible enthusiasm and inspirational creativity. \nIn the summer of 1982 we filmed \nThe call was from solicitors representing Enid Blyton\u2019s estate. They had read about our show and were threatening an injunction. It was agreed that lawyers for both the estate and the publishers could view the film later that day. The viewing took place in my tiny office at Charlotte Street. We squeezed two barristers, two solicitors, Enid Blyton\u2019s niece and the man from Hodder & Stoughton into the room and switched on the VCR. With C4 colleagues I stood outside, watching through the glass wall. One by one, the lawyers were covering their faces with their papers in order to hide unseemly mirth.\nWe got to the night scene of a tent into which Timmy the dog had his head and front quarters. His rear end was sticking out and his tail was wagging vigorously. The immortal line from Dawn French, \u201cOh Timmy, you\u2019re so licky\u201d, heralded the end of any composure. One of the solicitors couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and she loudly guffawed. The tears were running down her face and that relaxed the others. Soon my wee room was full of laughing lawyers. The man from H&S also laughed. The lady from the Blyton estate didn\u2019t. Mr H&S gently chided me as they left. He thought that we had pushed our luck but that it was really funny. The show went out to a mixed reception, seriously splitting the audience down the middle. That felt to me like a result \u2013 as did the fact that I didn\u2019t get fired on Channel 4\u2019s first day of transmission.\nFor some reason, the IBA had a stricter code on language for comedy and entertainment than it had for documentary or drama. There was constant dialogue between us about whether or not certain swearwords were funny and/or acceptable. It was like a war of attrition, an amiable war but a long war nonetheless. We\u2019d argue the \u201cfuck\u201d count for \nOften we were arguing from completely different standpoints with little or no common cultural reference points. Jeremy Isaacs persuaded the watchdog to allow a screening of \nThen came \nThere followed, unsurprisingly, many difficult exchanges with the IBA, Mary Whitehouse muttering about criminal blasphemy, and a toe-curling appearance on \nWe were now no longer permitted to transmit live. We recorded on Friday night for a Saturday evening transmission. After each recording a VHS copy of the show was sent to Channel 4 controller Paul Bonner. The producers and I met on Saturday mornings to edit the show taking into account Paul\u2019s notes.\nWhat could possibly go wrong? The new system worked for a while until the production team got a tip-off that news and current affairs bosses were being warned off any mention of alleged sexual shenanigans involving a very senior member of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Cabinet. This was the era of the D-notice \u2013 an official request to editors not to publish or broadcast certain items because of national security. But we were lowly entertainment beings, therefore not party to any news briefings. A sketch was performed in which Jimmy Mulville interrupted an interview in front of the audience. Something bad had happened, he said and, in a handheld camera shot, we all left the studio and tracked through the reception area into the gents\u2019 lavatory. Above the urinals there was graffiti. It read: \u201cThe Cabinet Minister involved in the sex scandal is\u2026\u201d and then the first two letters of his name, with the rest scribbled out. Who on earth could it be?\nNext morning, we started the edit fully expecting a phone call with instructions to remove the offending item. It never came. The sketch was transmitted. There were understandably demands for heads to roll. As ever, Jeremy Isaacs was a pillar of strength throughout and, although he was unhappy with our actions, gave us his full support. There was to be no \nThe channel then installed an experienced current affairs executive producer, John Gau. He was a lovely man who was never quite sure why he was there but seemed to enjoy every minute of it. We continued to upset people \u2013 only now with John\u2019s blessing. Importantly, \nMy new job was to give me the opportunity to realise a major ambition. Saturday entertainment has always been a challenge for television channels. \nWith the weight and experience of London Weekend Television production behind us, we went on air in 1985. The first series had a different guest presenter each week and introduced all sorts of new faces to television. It made stars of Ben Elton and Harry Enfield. It introduced us to Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. Channel 4 favourites Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson brought us the Dangerous Brothers, a genuinely funny take on slapstick \u2013 with added genuine danger.\nThe second series was fronted by Ben and Harry, the latter creating the characters Stavros and Loadsamoney. By the time we moved to Friday, Ben and Harry were well established and Loadsamoney had become the iconic symbol of Thatcher\u2019s Britain. Amongst the new faces in those series were Paul Merton, Julian Clary, Jo Brand and Lee Evans as well as Bing Hitler, aka Craig Ferguson.\nIn 1986 two young researchers came up with the next big thing. They were working on the music show \nWe were going to make a pilot so we would have to find a host. Alan, Jonathan and I spent a lot of time searching for the elusive talent. We auditioned in London and at the Edinburgh Festival. We drew a blank. Over the course of this search Jonathan would brief the candidates and demonstrate what style was required. It soon became obvious that he was far better suited to the role than any of the hopefuls we had seen. I asked him if he would do it. He said yes.\nWe made the pilot. I thought that Jonathan was great but the show didn\u2019t work. We had to find a new producer. I showed the tape to several noted names. None of them got it, nor could they see what I saw in Jonathan. The words \u201cspeech impediment\u201d came up more than once. The one person who shared my confidence was Colin Callender. Colin had produced the acclaimed Nicholas Nickelby early in Channel 4\u2019s life. The Callender Company would make the show.\nColin brought Katie in to produce it as she had experience both of studio shows and of working with Jonathan Ross. The first show went out very late on 6 February 1987. We pre-recorded it at 5pm and, from the minute we finished that first recording, we all knew that we had something very special. It felt different to any other chat show. It felt fresh. It felt right. The pre-recording and the transmission time felt wrong. It should be live and it should be earlier.\nIn those days at Channel 4, new challenges could be met with brave resolve. Jeremy Isaacs listened to my case for a live show and asked what my preferred slot would be. I said that the show would play well at 10.30pm. From day one, this slot had been a sort of \u201cdisease of the week\u201d slot. Putting an irreverent chat show in there would fundamentally change Channel 4 on a Friday night. Quite.\nWe got the green light to go live as soon as possible allowing for print TV listings to be in sync. It took less than four weeks until \nThe next big challenge was improvised comedy. Improv had been tried on earlier shows but had failed. Hat Trick pointed out that there was a great new show on Radio 4 that would work really well on television. \nWhen the BBC found out that we were interested, Dan ended up in the middle of a bidding war. Controller of BBC2 Alan Yentob personally took on the job of winning the show so poor old Dan was getting frantic phone calls yanking him in every direction. I\u2019m sure that Hat Trick\u2019s involvement helped win the day for Channel 4 and I honestly believe he made the correct choice. It was the right home for the show. It proved to be another huge hit and ran for 10 years on the channel. Dan\u2019s company still makes the show in the US.\nAt the end of the Eighties there were many changes at Channel 4, not least the departure of Jeremy Isaacs and the arrival of Michael Grade. I ended up as controller of arts and entertainment and deputy director of programmes. It wasn\u2019t as grand as it sounds. I didn\u2019t do much deputising and I didn\u2019t have a programme budget. Jonathan Ross and Alan Marke had found an exciting new act and were seeking a commission. The problem was that none of the commissioning editors wanted to spend any of their budgets on the idea. There was, however, a contingency budget to be won and Michael Grade was the man to convince. Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer were performing their show live at the Albany theatre in Deptford in south-east London. We took Michael to see the show or rather he took us in his chauffeur-driven car \u2013 lots of us all squashed in. He got it right away. \nI left Channel 4 in 1990, just as newsroom sitcom\u00a0\nOver the years Channel 4 has continued to offer fresh takes on comedy. Titles such as\nComedy has flourished on 4. "]}
