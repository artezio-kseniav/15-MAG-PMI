* в данной работе использовались следующие методы для кластеризации:
Bag Of Words with Naive Bayes
Term Frequency with Naive Bayes
TFIDF with Naive Bayes
TFIDF with SVM and K-Fold algorithm with k = 5
TFIDF with Naive Bayes and K-Fold algorithm with k = 5
TFIDF with SVM - 90% of data remain for testing
TFIDF with SVM and K-Fold algorithm with k = 5 - 20 classes
BOW - NB - KFOLD - 20 classes
TFIDF - 5-NN - Distance Weights - 20% test
TFIDF - 5-NN - Uniform Weights - 20% test
TFIDF - 5-NN - Distance Weights - KFOLD
TFIDF - 5-NN - Distance Weights - KFOLD - 20 classes
I have found that TFIDF with SVM have the best performance.
